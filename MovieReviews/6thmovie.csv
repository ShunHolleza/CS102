"masonsaul","7 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.","

"blott2319-1","20 July 2022","I think most people thought it was a big mistake when Disney cut ties with Lord & Miller before they completed their Solo film. Now I'm not so sure. It's a little off-putting having a downright farcical movie in an established cinematic universe. Thor: Love and Thunder is about as grounded as a Naked Gun movie, but for some reason the comedy rarely hits for me, where I can enjoy it in an actual spoof. I was surprised, despite the nearly constant attempts at humor, the crowded theater I was in rarely did more than chuckle. If they're going to make a straight-up comedy then they need it to be more laugh-out-loud funny. Of course comedic taste is extremely subjective, so I'm sure some people enjoy laughing along. I just wish it was as effective as Taika Waititi's other films have been for me (including Thor Ragnarok.)The real problem with Thor: Love and Thunder is that it is so irreverent but they also try to tackle heavier topics. The film starts with the death of a child, it focuses on a major character dealing with cancer, and the villain is literally called ""the god butcher."" Going back to my comparison to The Naked Gun, it's like you are watching that film and the filmmakers expect you to feel bad about Nordberg almost getting killed. There is no weight to anything, and it undercuts any attempt at emotion. I'd be genuinely shocked if someone told me they shed a tear while watching this movie, even if the humor lets up at the big climactic moment, though it clearly is trying for some real heart-tugging. I can take a light-hearted movie in the MCU where nothing of vital importance happens, but there are some important plot points, and that's a problem.That's not the only problem with Thor: Love and Thunder, and I could probably go on a full tirade about many of the other issues. However, I will restrain myself and just hit each one like quick bullet points. The handing off of Mjolnir like a loyal pet kind of undermines the magic of the whole ""worthy"" thing established prior to this film. The quick shuffling off of the Guardians of the Galaxy is about as shoddy as Chris Pratt's hair in the film. The whole god convention sequence is atrocious and makes you feel like Gorr has the right idea. Thor has become as shallow and dumb as the version they featured on the What If show. The handing off of Thor's lightning powers to anyone at any time with any weapon makes him look rather selfish in prior films when they could have used a bit of extra help against someone like Thanos. The deus ex machina of the Eternity wish now makes previous plans of people like Thanos and even the Scarlet Witch feel over-complicated when all they needed was a quick trip with Stormbreaker. I'll stop there, but the really sad thing about all this is that it has taken less than 3 years for the MCU to go from a franchise where I couldn't bear to miss a single film, to a franchise where I might just skip out on some movies because the quality has dipped so dramatically.","

"ryrymadrid","9 July 2022","I'm a huge marvel fanboy, and hardly ever have anything bad to say to about the MCU, but this was a huge letdown. Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.","

"TakeUpReel","14 July 2022","...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) ""comedy.""During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The ""jokes"" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There's too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought...""I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie."" That's not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.","

Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.","

"mluinstra","13 July 2022","There are so many things wrong with this film, I'm not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor's costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she's a girl. I guess Queen wasn't good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other ""Thors"" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor's clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.","

"afatedcircle","8 July 2022","First off let's start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif's arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There's so much of it that it isn't even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going ""can we get on with the movie?"". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The ""serious"" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, ""funny"" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that's one of many reasons it wasn't enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems ""final"".Thor steals Zeus' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn't it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn't they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor ""gives him a beer"" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr's resurrected daughter. It's just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok's mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.","

"FeastMode","8 July 2022","This review will come off as very negative, but I had a decent time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, Love and Thunder is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving two goats that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or the 20 times after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is a horrendous decision...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. I can only imagine what could have been if 40% of the movie was dedicated to that character. I can only imagine how amazing it would have been if they treated the God Butcher like The Dark Knight treated Joker.Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me.EDIT: I decided to give this another shot. Sometimes it's easier the second time without the hype and knowing what to expect. But I felt pretty much the same. I enjoyed a lot of it, but the stuff I disliked bothered me just as much.The two things that stood out to me the second time around, Bale's performance is amazing and they are idiots for underutilizing him. And the goats are the single worst thing in the entire MCU. Changing rating from 6 to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022, IMAX 7/20/2022)","

"FallenEye","14 July 2022","Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil.""Gorr - The God Butcher"", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn't have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi's egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don't interpret this as me ""bashing"" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it's their parents' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: ""Whatever it Takes"".Thor: Love and Thunder: ""Whatever"".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would've made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth's family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I'm not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I'm merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I'm just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I'd ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would've laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.","

The Matrix franchise has done it, and this one has done it. It is sad really.The acting is decent, and actors deliver as much as possible, but it lacks continuity, a rational story and so much more. The atrocity that is Russell Crowe's character and performance is just absurd. Christian Bale is as angst ridden as ever and delivers it well, but what a wasted performance on a nonsensical script.The story is bad, the directing is pretty bad, everything including the music is over the top and absurd.I understand how the screaming goats felt in this film and wanted to scream with them!","

There's a Crowe God takes us to new lows, waffles along with ridiculous prose, but he isn't alone, most of this makes you moan, you're relieved when it gets to the close.Taika Waititi fails to pull another Jo Jo Rabbit out of his increasingly emptying bag, in a film that leaves you groaning and squirming, from the ridiculous to the inept, from the absurd to the disengaging and detaching disconnect. Not sure why Christian Bale presents as Marilyn Manson but it's probably the only thing that works, although possibly not as intended.","

I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.","

Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.","

Not so forgettable, because you remember when you hit something ""bad"".Thor is an abomination, because it ruins a whole franchise. It is so bad, it makes work that has nothing to do with the movie itself unwatchable. Thor 1-3 are different in itself, but they are good movies. Not the most awesome, but really enjoyable entertainment. I'd love to watch them again some time. But how am I supposed to do this again? When you see SIF in Thor 1, you will think of the worst death scene ever invented in the history of entertainment from Thor 4 and you won't get immersed into the movie. If I see Avengers again, I will think of this ""funny"" Thor and not of the great hero they created once.And even if you want to make ""Naked Gun"" in the marvel universe, how does Bales character fit in here? If you cut his scenes together, you won't believe it is the same movie.Disney has some amazing talent, they created great things. But they are ruining the Star Wars and the Marvel franchise.

This just became a movie about a superhero who finally snapped and decided to act as a complete idiot from now on... What a great way to destroy years of character development.The writing is just lazy and the director made an excellent work of transforming it into a parody movie of itself. Actually, that was my father's first questions after watching the first 10 minutes of this movie, ""Is that a Thor parody?""Cristian Bale is great, as always, and I am saddened that he had to stain his filmography with this movie.I could go on and on about all the things wrong with this movie but I have already wasted 2 hours of my life watching it and don't want to waste any more time on it.

"jtindahouse","6 July 2022","I sometimes feel like Taika Waititi is wasting his talents making MCU movies when he could be making great original content. But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.","

So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn't have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren't even funny, it's like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don't care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be ""politically correct"" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.","

Poor Thor becomes this silly caricature of the hero and the only person that feels like a real character is Christian Bale who luckily actually acts like a true villain.Imagine a nightmare cross of Guardians of the Galaxy and Dumb and Dumber with a Soap Opera Thor
behaving like a silly fool - and throw in fatty Russell Crowe as a silly Zeus with a hilarious pathetic Greek accent and the topping is 2 large goats with annoying screams.A total train wreck that I had to turn off in the middle because it was intolerable and Taika selection of music gets old fast. And I grew up in the 80s
Eat my hammer Guns n RosesWatch it for the cgi and Christian bale - and for the Children ( yes that is the main crux is saving the children of fantasy Disneyland Askard ha ha ).It makes one wonder what Taika and Disney are smoking these days and what kind of disaster will be created by Taika with Star Wars.1 star because Zero not available.","

"frommeltstephanie","9 July 2022","While not the worst Marvel film, it is certainly not worthy of high praise. Ragnarok was a masterpiece but Taika falls incredibly short of expectations for a bar that was set high in the beginning phases of the MCU. I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't love it, and that is a trend with some of their recent offerings. I'm on the fence about a rating of 7, but my favorite MCU movies are in the 8-10 range.Characters:
Thor has been reduced to a joke and doesn't have the appeal he once had. Why does he look like a carnie ala Joe Dirt? Why is he so weak, dumb and needy?Valkayrie's character has been reduced to a lesser version of her former self and her rule of New Asgard was pitiful and lacked inspiration. Tessa's talent was totally wasted.Christian Bale's performance, while exceptional was a bit too Voldemort-esque.The appearance of the Guardians was lame -who would look up to Starlord? Chris Pratt came across as a white trash version of the character first introduced and has completely lost his likability. Rocket is the best character in the Guardians and he barely had any lines.The first battle was against hawklike chicken muppets riding Star Wars knockoff vehicles and they just weren't formidable in the least.The cameos were fun (Hella) and the goats were annoying when they didn't have to be.Music:
The use of music was ill-timed and not matched to the action -no offense to GNR, but why so much of their music? November Rain was the only song that seemed to be paired well with the action. There are so many 80's rock and metal songs that would have made a better fit .Plot:
Boring and drawn-out. Pay no attention to the commenters whining about ""wokeness"" and this has nothing to do with anything other than their own prejudice and intolerance. The humor was dumb, childish and just not that funny or witty, unless maybe you are a 8 year old boy raised by immature parents.I'm a huge Marvel fan but I have been so disappointed in recent offerings that are a result of Disney greed, poor writing and lazy directing.","

"mrglenngrant","21 July 2022","This is a hard film to review cos as a Marvel fanboy I enjoyed the story and seeing one of my very favourite characters again ... and also getting Jane as The Mighty Thor - and not thru some multiverse trickery, as I suspected.With that in mind, and I do really like Taika as a writer and director (see Jo-Jo Rabbit) ... but I don't think I like that they've allowed him to apply his 'touch' to Thor. It makes me uncomfortable. The forced jokes and parody just don't sit well with me and I long for a more 'serious' take for a Thor movie. Other marvel films have embraced humour (Ant-Man is a great example) but not at the expense of the characters ... but Thor seems to have done a 180 in terms of personality at times - at times coming across as an idiot, which is really sad.I also didn't enjoy the borderline camp and racist Zeus ... which was a waste of Russell Crowe's talent and if that was all Taika's idea then shame on him. This was easily the least enjoyable portion of the movie for me.The Guardians also seemed a little like a wasted opportunity and for all the effort of getting them together for the movie I expected them to be in more than the first 10 minutes.I think this was better then Ragnarok - but neither were better than the first Thor ... or maybe even the second (gasp!).67/100.","

"ladyliliroche","6 July 2022","Maybe I did hype myself too much but since it is coming from Ragnarok and Taika Waititi, I have high expectation for this movie.Chris Hemworth is great to look at. That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.","

"namob-43673","7 July 2022","I had very low exceptions. Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this. This is on par with the worst of the genre and I cannot phantom who can honestly like this.","

"gavinp9","6 July 2022","'Thor: Love and Thunder' (or Thor 4) is a bridge between 'Avengers: Endgame' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3' and is not really linked to any of the other recent MCU films/TV shows, but it does a really good job of building on 'Thor: Ragnarok' and the spirit of that film, including making Valkyrie (Thompson) and Korg (Waititi) the two main sidekicks of Thor (Hemsworth, who both ground him and add humour.The plot is based around Gorr (Bale) having a sword that can kill gods, set-up well in the first 10min, and at the same time, Jane (Portman) being back as ""The Mighty Thor"" and being able to wield Mjolnir. A lot of this is explained in nice quirky montages, courtesy of Korg. There's plenty of great cameos - from a lot of Aussies too, since it was filmed here - but the biggest (not a spoiler) is Russell Crowe as Zeus, who has a semi-important role, and is great.Love & Thunder is very fast-paced, using the soundtrack excellently - especially four Guns N Roses songs - and it's amazing the difference of ""the vibe"" during/after 'Thor: The Dark World' and 9 years later compared to this film. The black and white scene is excellent, there's plenty of battles and whenever it starts to get too serious, there's some well-placed jokes. The ending seems fitting and leaves you happy to see where Thor's journey takes him.","

"duggies70","31 May 2023","I loved the start. The back story of Gorr was wonderful. I never liked or cared about the movie version of Jane Foster. This did nothing to change that. Making her the principal character left me with little hope this movie would please me.The constant bad jokes were just annoying. Not only were they not humorous, they were ill timed. The king/queen of Asgard doing TV commercials was pathetic. I'd heard plenty of bad reviews on this movie, but they didn't do it justice; it's much worse than I'd heard.I'm not certain how the Valkyrie that abandoned Asgard somehow ends up as ""The Woman King?"" But now everyone's a god, so no one is?","

"rghvvikas","7 July 2022","It's surely a disappointing one from Marvel, After a disastrous Ms Marvel show i expected something concrete from Marvel. The Movie is full of comic punches even at the more intense scenes. Christian Bale did a fantastic job at God Butcher but there is just not enough of him for my appetite. Gorr fails to represent himself a Threat at any level to Thor or any other god because we don't get to see the depth of character. The movie feels to be very rushed, it was like watching 4 mini episodes of a single series. The climax was just way more obvious. The Only saving grace I think was of Mighty Thor Arc which was executed beautifully otherwise it was all just a filler for phase five MCU.Watch it once for the sake of continuation if you are an MCU follower rest you can easily skip it. Honestly if it was not a part of a franchise, it's totally not worth going to theatre.","

"MiroslavKyuranov","6 July 2022","Taika has managed to balance humor, emotion and action in a way that must be experienced in order to be described. The story is more than interesting. Once again, Waititi points us in a certain direction, and just when you think you know what's going to happen, he turns our heads. If you liked ""Ragnarok"" you'll like this one too, if not...well probably this movie will not be your cup of tea.At this point, everyone knows that Hemsworth was born for the role of Thor, but in this movie, he elevates his character to a completely different level...you'll see.Natalie Portman returns as Jane, but unlike previous films in which she was not a particularly interesting character, Taika has applied her magic and, in addition to embodying her in Mighty Thor, makes her a well-built character. Her return to the franchise is important for Thor's graduation, but it also tells us a story you can't watch indifferently. She's also funny, something we can't say about her previous incarnations in the role.All other supporting characters such as Valkyrie, Korg and Guardians also add a pinch or more of themselves to the final product. The chemistry between Thor and the Guardians is ridiculous, something we already saw in ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"". The chemistry between Valkyrie and Mighty Thor is something I can watch all day. Korg has a bigger role than and every scene is pure pleasure - that's what happens when you make enough pamphlets for a revolution!Christian Bale...frankly it's still surreal that he's part of the MCU, but his role as Gorr The Godbutcher is quite the reason for an actor of his caliber to perform it. Gorr is brutal, some of his scenes will remain etched in my mind for a long time, but not his radical actions are the only thing that makes his character memorable. You know that once the villain of the movie makes you sympathize with him and understand him, he is more than ""another villain"".One of the best action scenes in the entire Marvel universe is in ""Love And Thunder""! I can't wait to watch the movie again! The film feels like a collection of several comic book editions of Thor, adapted in the form of a film, flooded with a solid dose of style and music from the 80's.""Thor: Love And Thunder"" is all that was expected and more. Taika doesn't do more of the same, but pushes the boundaries even more, giving you a solid dose of laughter, action and emotions that you may not be ready for! The film has many pleasant surprises for fans and the love for the details is visible. The film surpasses all expectations balancing absolutely bombastic insanity with moving character driven stories. Christian Bale is top tier and Natalie Portman is truly outstanding. Waititi may have just delivered the MCU's best movie of Phase 4 and certainly one of the top 10 in the entire Marvel universe.You know this, but still stay for the credit scenes, which are extremely important for future events at MCU!","

Not sure where this is going and how their current model is going to work if these films keep getting to a billion and Disney execs get what they want. Its going to take fans saying enough and voting with their pocketbook along with shareholders saying we invested in you to do great storytelling not just churn content and merchandise. And no apology for the cynical comments. It's clearly them banking not getting great writers.","

"philthegreatone-786-63058","7 July 2022","Thor with help from Valkyrie played by the great Tessa Thompson and his ex Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. They have to take on Gorr the Butcher played by Christian Bale. This film is visually stunning with some really funny typical Waititi humor.I really love the themes of redemption and love going on in this film. Waititi loves making films about misfits and children at the heart of his stories. There is a cool 80's soundtrack that I really liked. I love Tessa Thompson's character in particular the first bisexual character in the marvel universe. She is funny, heroic and sexy with an awkward sense of humor. Thompson is one of my favorite actress's right now. She can do small indie films with depth and great action films like this one. Hemsworth is always great funny, powerful and shows depth on screen as well. Natalie Portman as Jane Foster was terrific her character now has stage four cancer. She uses Thor's hammer to make herself better and have adventures with her love Thor again. Bale as the villain shows a real dark side but also depth to his character as well. As we seen before in Marvel films they humanize the villains. I really enjoyed this film and think it is one of the best films of 2022.","

"MrDHWong","7 July 2022","""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is the 29th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the fourth solo film to focus around the Marvel superhero Thor. Directed and co-written by Taika Waititi (""Thor: Ragnarok"", ""Jojo Rabbit"") and again starring Chris Hemsworth in the lead role, it continues the God of Thunder's journey throughout the universe in a solid adventure that both satisfies and saddens.After the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been in outer space with the Guardians of the Galaxy, visiting distant planets to help out their inhabitants with any problems they are facing. Some time later, Thor is forced to part way with the Guardians after he receives an emergency signal from New Asgard back on Earth. Upon arriving home, Thor is informed that a being known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) has come into possession of the god-murdering Necrosword and intends to wipe out all gods from existence, with the citizens of New Asgard next on his hit list. With this new danger looming, Thor hurriedly recruits his associates Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi), and his old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), the latter of whom has taken up the mantle of ""Mighty Thor"", to stop Gorr from his deicidal killing spree.Since he was first introduced into the MCU back in 2011, Thor's solo films have been, to put it mildly, a mixed bag. The first two struggled to find a harmonious tone, with an inconsistent blend of out-of-place comedy and unnecessarily dark moments preventing them from becoming memorable additions to the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, if it weren't for the amusing antics of Loki (Tom Hiddleston), I assume most people would skip these two films without a second thought. All of this was rectified in 2017 with ""Thor: Ragnarok"" finally striking the right balance between humorous and serious themes, all of which can be traced back to the involvement of Taika Waititi. All of that remains here in ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", as it thankfully continues everything that made its predecessor such a great inclusion to the MCU.Though it doesn't deviate too much from the previous film in terms of tone, this one still retains the same amount of fun and energy that all the MCU fans crave. Here, we get to see Thor as a more upbeat character, who has worked through many of his personal insecurities that were holding him back following his fight with Thanos years ago. He is more optimistic and sure of himself, and despite causing the occasional collateral damage like most superheroes, he always finds ways to make up for it (or at the very least TRIES to).I like how over the course of three prior solo outings and four ""Avengers"" films, Thor has since developed some of the most relatable humanistic traits in the whole MCU, which is interesting considering the character is supposed to be a perfect god. We've seen him go through a wide range of personality changes, from self-important deity, humbled defender of Earth, depressed wreck haunted by his mistakes, and now a man contemplating what his future might bring. But it is in the latter example we see Thor delve deep into what is arguably the most important emotion of all: Love.Considering the film has the word ""Love"" in its title, it stands to reason that it will be the overarching theme its main character will grapple with. Long time MCU fans will remember Thor's original love interest Jane Foster, the astrophysicist from the first two movies whose belief in a scientific explanation for everything is shattered when she meets the God of Thunder for the first time. Though the two seemed to hit it off at first, certain factors prevented the pair from going any further, leading to their break-up and, in turn, her not appearing in the third film.Foster returns here with a vengeance as she makes up for her absence with her new identity as ""Mighty Thor"". Watching as Thor tries to comprehend the sight of his ex-girlfriend donning not only similar attire to him but also using a repaired version of his old hammer Mjolnir provided some amusing comic relief upon their reunion and the way he handles this situation shows how far he has come as a character. He now truly feels a love for someone unlike anything he has felt previously, allowing the story to take their relationship to levels not seen before.In addition to implementing all of these new romantic elements, director Taika Waititi also uses his eye for visual detail to the film's advantage. He shows us brightly coloured locations such as the Omnipotent City, a sprawling metropolis populated by various other gods, including Zeus himself (played by Russell Crowe). Waititi uses this place in particular to show how these gods all have different attitudes to what their titles may suggest. For instance, some of these gods actually care about the well-being of the less fortunate while others just find their positions nothing more than a burden. These moments allow for some quirky universe-building that only a film set in the MCU could properly pull off.But it's not all vibrant environments we get to see. There's also the Shadow Realm, a sinister place lit only by the colours of black and white. When our heroes arrive at this menacing location, the film starts to resemble those classic colourless feature films, tapping into that old school feeling of people exploring somewhere frightening. The movie's antagonist Gorr appropriately considers this place home and his dark intentions suit it to a tee. The way in which Waititi is able to balance these two polar opposite locations alongside one another is testament to his talent as a filmmaker and goes to show that his presence among the MCU staff is a welcome one.Returning to the role after a three-year absence, Chris Hemsworth demonstrates how much he has evolved alongside Thor as a character, going from a stoic overpowered god to a fun-loving hero not afraid to show his sensitive side. Hemsworth uses his signature Aussie larrikin likeability to bring out the amusement factor that makes what I call the ""Waititi-era"" Thor a more endearing hero than when he was first introduced. His scenes with Natalie Portman as Jane Foster had a believable warmth to them, which is surprising since I always thought they lacked chemistry with one another in the first two films. I guess it was simply poor writing in those movies because with the way the pair interact here you'd swear their relationship always had this much of a spark to it. With that in mind, Portman is clearly enjoying herself more this time, considering she has a more physical role in the story than before. It's nice to see her occasionally one-up her co-star during the film's action scenes as she manages to hold her own when the going gets tough.I also think Christian Bale did a good job as the film's main villain Gorr, a man hell-bent on causing the extinction of all gods. Knowing how talented an actor Bale is, it was nice to see him provide the character with more dimension than your typical MCU antagonist. Without venturing into spoiler territory, Gorr's backstory is shown to be quite tragic, immediately clueing the audience into why he is on this genocidal crusade in the first place. The best types of villains are the ones who think they are doing everything for the greater good (like a certain purple Titan wielding a gauntlet), and I did feel sorry for Gorr once I understood his motivations, although this of course doesn't justify him wanting to murder the innocent.Now four solo movies in, it's great to see how a hero like Thor has finally found the appropriate balance between a powerful god and a regular person. Though I think there is little else that can be done in future films to develop the character beyond what we have right now, we can still appreciate him for what he is already - a genuine person with relatable flaws. And that is what I believe to be one of the reasons why the MCU has been successful for so long - it shows that heroes, even literal gods, are capable of going through legitimate growth and changes to become better people. That and the casual humour of course. Either way, it has proven to be a winning combination.I rate it 8/10.","

"theffachrif","6 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is about The Space Viking Thor Odinson, after teaming up with Guardians of the Galaxy to help everyone in the galaxy who are in distress. And later he travels to New Asgard to fight a new threat in Gorr The God Butcher who've vowed that all gods will die, only to discover his ex, Jane Foster, who now wields Mjolnir and became the Mighty Thor.I liked this movie as much as I did with Thor Ragnarok. The visuals and cinematography are slightly more colorful and stunning than before. The humor is slightly funnier and sillier as well. And the actions are fun as hell.And again, the pacing and runtime are the issues for me with this movie. Because some moments are happened relatively quick, like when Gorr becomes The God Butcher and Jane becomes The Mighty Thor. A little backstory or a flashback about the necrosword would be neat. Although it didn't really affect the overall story so it didn't bother me that much, I just wanted some more after what they did in Multiverse of Madness.MAN, Christian Bale really lived long enough to see himself become the villain. His performance as Gorr possibly is the best villain portrayal in the MCU to date. And seeing Natalie Portman back together with Chris Hemsworth since The Dark World is a pleasure. I'm satisfied with the ending it definitely lives up to the title ""Love and Thunder"".(SPOILER TIME) (SPOILER TIME) (SPOILER TIME)In the post-credit scene, I was hoping Loki would show up considering he actually died in the main timeline.

Sadly in MCU Thor was only once really Thor and it was in Avengers: Infinity War, where we finally feel that he is the protector of Midgard and the God of thunder as in mythology. I'm not saying that Taika Waititi is a bad director, but the fact is he wrote and directed this empty movie with some jokes. He could maybe make a great Deadpool movie but Thor should have been more than this. Even Christian Bale's outstanding performance as Gorr couldn't save it.

"Zeus-pro","7 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is largely successful in honoring Thor's long journey towards self-actualization and rarely falters while keying into the crackling chemistry between leads Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Tessa Thompson. It's essentially the MCU's first romantic comedy, and plays with those tropes in delightful ways. But while Thor and Jane's relationship is handled well, Love and Thunder is less deft -- and a lot safer than you'd expect -- in pushing the greater MCU story forward. Christian Bale's Gorr feels underutilized and Tessa Thompson's King Valkyrie takes a frustrating back seat, especially as the movie goes on. Taika Waititi's signature humor and visual style persist from Ragnarok, and are essential to buoying the movie through its cookie-cutter plot. With Hemsworth as enthusiastic an Asgardian as ever, Thor's future with both love and thunder are bright.","

"fredschaefer-406-623204","17 July 2022","I am a lifelong reader of Marvel comics, and have consistently tried to see every single MCU film in the theater going back to the first Captain America film. I was blown away by INFINITY WAR and ENDGAME, and unlike some fans that have soured on Marvel's super hero adventures after the latter, I've hung in there, finding a lot to like even in film efforts that paled when compared to what came before. Though Robert Downey Jr. And Chris Evans have retired their parts as Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, there was still the consolation that Chris Hemsworth would continue as Thor, the Asgardian God of Thunder. Hemsworth is a perfect fit in the role, with a real movie star's physical presence, and a good sense for comedy, two attributes that are not always evident in others. For these reasons, I was really looking forward to THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER, the first stand alone Thor adventure since the excellent THOR: RAGNAROK back in 2017.Sadly, I was disappointed. Though I didn't find LOVE AND THUNDER to be the disaster some fans did, I thought the film was done in by a script and a director that took the God of Thunder down the wrong path in a big way. I have admired a lot of Taika Waititi's work in the past, especially on RAGNAROK and JOJO RABBIT, but this time he leaned into the humor way too much, doubling down, and then tripling down, on the humorous elements that worked so well in RAGNAROK, but forgetting that there needs to be some heart and sincere emotion for the humor to play off. That's something that even a lesser MCU film like last summer's BLACK WIDOW pulled off well. LOVE AND THUNDER picks up post ENDGAME where Thor is roaming the galaxy with the GUARDIANS, enjoying the adventures of being Space Viking. But soon, he is back on earth trying to hunt down a villain going by the name of Gorr the God Butcher, who, for reasons of his own, is going about systematically killing off all the mythical Gods of the many civilizations spread throughout the universe. This is where Thor, and his trusty sidekick Korg (CGI, but voiced by Waititi) meet up with his old flame, Jane Foster, who is now wielding the hammer, Mjolnir, and going by the name of Lady Thor. After an awkward reunion, Thor, Jane, Korg, and Valkyrie (again played by Tessa Thompson) are off in search of help to fight Gorr, who has kidnapped the children of New Asgard. What drags this plot down is the incessant humor, with most of the jokes centered on Thor being a clueless oaf, and his relationship with his ex, who is now his equal when it comes to super heroics. And for the first two thirds of the film, that is just about all it is: setup and punch line...setup and punch line...repeat and repeat. And in case we didn't get the joke, Korg says something to underline it. The God of Thunder himself is reduced to being a big muscle bound doofus in scene after scene, a far cry from the prideful and earnest character trying to do what is right and be worthy that we knew in The Avengers films and his own earlier solo screen appearances. I agree with those who say that much of the film felt like badly written SNL skit-especially Zeus's lightning bolt, which looked as if it had been found in NBC's prop room. Having Matt Damon, Sam Neill, and Luke Hemsworth (joined by newcomer Melissa McCarthy) reprise their cameos from RAGNOROK only diminished the joke, and the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY were totally superfluous the story. There should be a new rule that cameos have to be pertinent to the plot in some way. I have no idea what they were going for in Russell Crowe's small part as Zeus, a part played in a way that seemed to belong in another movie. And the deficits in the script only highlighted how badly this film relied on CGI effects.Only in the final third, when there is a showdown with Gorr, does the story switch gears, and it feels like we're in a real super hero film. And that is because Christian Bale, who plays Gorr, really does show up and give a heartfelt performance. Gorr's origin in the pre-credits opening is well done, and anytime Bale was onscreen, everything is kicks up a notch. But even he was hurt by an inconsistent script that had Gorr, traumatized by the loss of his daughter, turn around and terrorize the children of New Asgard.But despite my criticism, I won't say I hate LOVE AND THUNDER and consider the MCU dead the way many online have done. If you don't ask much of it, the film is entertaining, and I did like seeing the Marvel concept of Eternity brought to the screen. But mostly, I'm left with a sense of an opportunity missed. We didn't get a rousing adventure with a self described Space Viking, which would have been nice. But most of all, we don't get an idea of where the MCU is heading in this next phase. There were two post credits scene, one of which implied that a dead character might have a way back into the MCU, and in the other, we briefly glimpse a super powered being not shown before. I was hoping for something dealing with the next GUARDIANS film, or maybe a hint at who the Big Bad will be in this next phase. Then there is the introduction of the X-Men and the Fantastic Four to the MCU proper after MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS. It would have been nice to see some progress on that front. I know Covid has scrambled the time table for the MCU after ENDGAME, but right now, it feels as if they are simply treading water. And more films like LOVE AND THUNDER will burn up a lot of goodwill with fans like me.","

"CoopaSoopa","6 July 2022","After seeing doctor strange in the multiverse of madness; which I did enjoy; I came into this movie with rather mediocre expectations, overall I think the film was good but not great.The representation was incredible, and the cinematography was awesome, but the plot and character depth was rather stale, Gorr the main villain came off as both menacing but weak, and his whole characters story was rather shallow, as for Jane Foster however, her character was probably the best in the film. Thor was Thor as usual, and his overall character change by the end of the movie was not to extensive, but good.The side characters of the film, who still served good purpose for the plot were great, Valkyrie and Korg shined in there performances and were probably the funniest characters of the film. The Guardians of the Galaxy were great aswell, but didn't shine as much as they did in there previous film appearances, hopefully that's to change in the Holiday Special, and Guardians Vol. 3.To avoid spoilers I'll leave it at this, it's worth a watch, but it's not for everyone, I personally rate it between 6 - 7 out of 10, but one thing I'm left with is the fear that these films are soon to become cash grabs, and not genuine works of art, I see phase 4 as phase 1 (2.0), the stories created in these movies are gonna lead into a more extensive and greater plot, which I am excited, but worried about.I'm underwhelmed to say the least, but I'm happy that the film leaves the story open, and continued certain characters stories! It is worth the watch, but is probably not gonna go down as a marvel classic.","

"fluffchop","19 August 2022","My sister wanted to go to a movie with me. Ok let's see Thor I said. It was a little short at 2 hours or so for the money we paid. We've all seen Marvel films by now so it's a movie you know what to expect going into so it's not a gamble. Nothing to write home about but enjoyable. Interesting choice of soundtrack which will either be loved or hated by many I would say. It needed a good half hour more to flesh out the story. It was really quite short for a Marvel film. I'd watch it again when it comes on TV but wouldn't really recommend it to non-Marvel fans as I don't think it's very appealing overall.","

It looks like all Taika is good for (apart from repeatedly flashing his name every other line in the end credits) is satire. And yes, it's funny in part, but we're not laughing with you Marvel studios; We're laughing at you as the credibility of all your offerings is disembowelled one character at a time by self grandiosed charlatans like Taika Wahiti. Such a shame. Generations of comic book heroes destroyed by an unthinking egopath.","

"Vishal_s_kumar","6 July 2022","Thor: Ragnarok was a terrific movie, and Waititi has returned (with a co-writing credit) to deliver the next chapter in the ""Thor"" saga, restoring the atmosphere of the previous odyssey with a slightly heavier round of freewheeling fun, looking to keep the God of Thunder loose and amusing, but also hitting the big guy with some profound emotional weight this time out.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has cleaned himself up, feeling renewed purpose to help others with his weapon, Stormbreaker, and his Asgardian powers, happy to be part of the Guardians of the Galaxy with his pal, Korg (Taika Waititi). When the Guardians depart, looking to ditch Thor, the God of Thunder is left with a new threat in Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), a man who once believed in a higher power, only to learn of godly cruelties, inspiring a plan of revenge while armed with the devastating Necrosword. Gor is looking to slaughter all gods while trying to reach Eternity, kidnapping the children of New Asgard to tempt Thor into the open. However, the hero isn't easily defeated, joined by Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a gift of magical goats, and The Mighty Thor, with ex-girlfriend Jane (Natalie Portman) trying to prevent the spread of illness by claiming Mjonir's power, transforming her into a formidable warrior.Waititi does particularly well with villains, continuing his interest in dark paths with Gor, whose story is economically detailed in the prologue for ""Love and Thunder."" He was a simple man who trusted in his god, but Gor was betrayed by his faith, turned into a fool and soon a killer, taking the Necrosword on a journey to remove all gods from the universe. One doesn't hire Bale to play it cool, and the actor goes all out as Gor, with the skeletal figure of doom an unusual antagonist, living to torment others while setting out on a defined journey to Eternity, backed by creatures of the Shadow Realm. He's taken children, including Heimdall's son, to inspire a rescue mission, and Thor is ready for action. At least for the most part.""Love and Thunder"" finds Thor trying to find his place in the world again after time spent with the Guardians of the Galaxy, eager to return to power as the hero everyone looks up to, but writing disrupts such confidence with the reappearance of Jane, who's keeping herself alive with Mjolnir, which has reformed in the human's presence. Thor is floored by this reunion, unsure how to process seeing Jane as The Mighty Thor, wearing his outfit, and one of the best running gags in the feature is his secret interest in reconnecting with his beloved hammer, leading to some jealousy issues with Stormbreaker. ""Love and Thunder"" crisply arranges a plot and establishes emotional stakes, and it keeps the story on the move, sending Thor, Jane, Valkyrie, and Korg out into the world to acquire the help they need. This involves a visit to Zeus (a very silly Russell Crowe), with his powerful lightning bolt just the thing the gang needs to take on Gor.Waititi is making a comedy with ""Love and Thunder,"" working to revive the ""Ragnarok"" mood with defined playfulness from the cast, including Hemsworth, who seems to love playing Thor as an insecure Asgardian putting on a show of hypermasculinity to keep up appearances. Laughs are sizable in the endeavor, but there's a grim side to the screenplay that's a little harder for the helmer to manage. Jane's illness is addressed, and Gor's intro includes the death of his daughter, giving him the inspiration to rage. This heaviness doesn't always balance with goofiness, leading to a few awkward breaks in the action, but Waititi is trying to land a more sensitive ""Thor,"" and it works for the most part, exploring the tension between Thor and Jane as they work with their special powers and confront their personal history.Led Zeppelin is traded for Guns N' Roses in ""Love and Thunder,"" with Waititi keeping the metal cranked up and his visuals stunning, following the gang as they visit new lands, including the Shadow Realm, which turns everything black and white. The sequel successfully continues what ""Ragnarok"" started, developing personalities and action potential, keeping thrills coming and humor consistent. The new, fun Thor probably drives comic book enthusiasts crazy, but he does marvelously on the big screen, with Waititi understanding the bigness of the character, the colorfulness of his world, and the universal feeling of his uncertainty.","

Well talking about the movie if you know the movie director than you should probably get the idea of his movie making. As I being completely honest I was expecting more but still I like it what the director has deliver us. Chris Hemsworth is far More better than in the endgame. Natalie & Tessa simply nailed it with rest of the cast. Story could've been more better because you have such a powerful villain but I don't know what the director thought and movies runtime could be long rather than it's Christian Bale just nailed it. Yeah he has less screentime but whenever he comes at screen he'll just made your day. Director should've given a lot more time to Gorr but still nonetheless. Anyway It's a fun movie if you are a THOR fan you'll definitely like it but don't expect too much because it's a standalone film as it should be....","

"vermaarya-99725","6 July 2022","This movie is so much fun which I was expecting just watching the trailer. This is probably the best Thor movie to date but I have a few problems with it. One, The dialogue with Jane and her problems doesn't really hit for me and another thing is that this movie is a bit too similar to Ragnarok in the sense of cool epic shots like the one with Thor awakening in Ragnarok. All those scenes are great to look at but lose their charm after a while. Otherwise, Chris Hemsworth, Christian bale and Taika watiti are at their absolute best in this movie. Visually this is one of the best MCU movies to date. If you have strayed away from the MCU like me, give this a shot, it's worth it.","

"cardsrock","19 August 2022","Thor's fourth feature film increasingly blurs the line between fun and farce, although it mostly succeeds in what it sets out to do. Taika gets a little too much free reign as there are many unnecessary jokes. I really hope you like screaming goats. In addition, it's often hard to take the dramatic moments seriously when you think there's about to be a joke inserted to undercut it.Natalie is a nice addition as she brings some gravitas, however her character is saddled with some occasional poor dialogue. Hemsworth is game as always with his stellar comedic chops. His interactions with his various weapons are some of the best scenes in the film. The colors and vibrancy Waititi brings continues to be a highlight and one particular scene on a moon is stunning to watch. I have to say I also loved the GNR needle drops.It's not too often that I wish a film was longer, but this is one of those cases. I feel like we miss a lot of Thor-Jane moments we need to really feel the payoff here. Gorr is also shockingly underutilized and we barely see him butcher any gods. Bale goes all out with a phenomenal performance as one of the MCU's best villains, but I just wanted more.Love and Thunder is pretty standard Marvel fare that we're all accustomed to, which is fine, however I wouldn't mind a more consequential story in Thor's next cosmic outing.","

"dave_maguire","7 July 2022","I love Thor - maybe an unpopular opinion but the first Thor film is one of favourites in the whole MCU. The fish out of water comedy elements were great and Chris Hemsworth shone with these comic moments. Thor got funnier as the movies went on but still retained a serious edge to the character. Then Taika Waititi got hold of the franchise to tell a story of loss and pain with ragnarok, and turned him in to an all out comedy foil - And this is much the same as that movie. Don't get me wrong, I did laugh at some bits, but then immediately thought this is ridiculous. I know people clearly like him but in my opinion Waititi has no place being involved these films, if Gorr hasn't butchered your god, then pray to them that he is never allowed near the franchise again!Thor is an absolute idiot in this film, you can never tell if, in his serious moments he is actually being serious, or acting that way within the character. He also somehow gets in to a love triangle with mjolnir and stormbreaker???? With the exception of Portman the film is full of annoying characters to be honest -Valkyrie - never looks bothered about what she's doing in the film and doesn't even take part in the last battle cos ""she might get killed"", despite talking to Jane earlier in the film about how she wants her Viking death so she can get to Valhalla????? Speaking of Valhalla, Sif makes an appearance so she can instantly be dumbed down and not understand how you get in to he place - even I know how to get in to it!!Korg - time has come and gone for him and he is just annoying now, constant interrupts the serious moments and just has no point in being in the film.Overall it's just a very boring story, there's no real plot, Thor finds out someone is murdering gods, and just goes to kill him.... Synopsis done, that's it! Way too much filler in the film and pointless scenes just to drag it out far longer than it needed to be. I had also heard that Gorr is the best MCU villain since Thanos.... not the Gorr I saw - he's barely even in the film! I did find his shadow powers visually impressive, but overall though he was quite underwhelming, and didn't really understand the ending - which was also underwhelming.Don't get me wrong, thee are some good elements to the film, there are some excellent set pieces, the cinematography is great at times, Natalie Portman is the best part of the film and I found she has a very compelling story during the film, and there are some genuinely tender moments between her and Chris Hemsworth when the film allows. And the goats are funny.... You'll see.The most worrying thing is, after seeing what phase four has given us so far, I really worry where the MCU is headed as there doesn't seem to be any overarching story arch going on with these films, there was one scene in Shang chi about the rings, but the rest of the credit scenes just seem to be confined to their own movies. I honestly don't know where they are going, and with the last four films being very ""cosmic"" based, I'm not sure what is going to happen with Black panther next.Anyway, rant over so in closing I'll say, if you like ragnarok then you'll love this film, if not then maybe best to wait till it's free.","

"movieman6-413-929510","7 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is the fourth Thor film in the film series. Like the third Thor film, this film is directed and this time also partly written by Taika Waititi.In the film, after all his adventures, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is somewhat lost in his life and decides to go back to New Asgard. Before returning here, he learns that a dark creature called Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) is on a mission to kill all the gods.When he arrives in New Asgard he wants to ask Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) for help, but here he sees that his old hammer Mjolnir has been restored, but has found another owner. This owner is his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who has magically taken over his hammer and powers. Along with Valkyrie and Korg (voice of Taika Waititi), both try to stop Thors Gorr before he manages to kill more gods.With this film, Tor is the first superhero from the Marvel film series to have four films of his own. Taika Waititi managed to get the Thor series moving again with the third Thor movie and is trying to do the same again with this fourth movie. Together with other script and story writers from other Marvel projects, he managed to turn the third Thor film into a more appropriate comedy action Sci-Fi film. In this fourth Thor film, the writing comes only from Taika Waititi herself and the more aspiring writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. The fact that the writing now comes from fewer people is reflected in the film. This fourth Thor film contains too many comedy elements, which often unnecessarily overshadow the drama moments and other elements. The comedy also comes at the cost of some of the different storylines, making some of these seem a bit rushed and if not clear which can sometimes lead to a more long-winded feel.Fortunately, Taika Waititi knows how to provide beautiful and believable visual effects in the film and thus brings out different worlds of the gods in creative ways. For example, he brings out the divine sides of the Marvel film universe more clearly and more playfully than they tried to do in the Marvel film Eternals, for example. In this film he also manages to use rock music from the 80s as a soundtrack in a fun and appropriate way.The returning cast members once again reprise their roles in this film. Despite the lesser sides of the script, Taika Waititi managed to persuade Natalie Portman to return to the Thor film series. Portman gets more drama sides with this film, but also super power sides to work with. In addition to Natalie Portman, Taika Waititi also managed to get Christian Bale back to act in a superhero movie with the script and request of his children. After his time as Batman in The Dark Knight trilogy, he no longer wanted to act in superhero movies. Bale brings a darker serious side to this film, adding more darkness and some light tension.","

"cthirlby","7 July 2022","Had high hopes for this film. The fact Jane was in it I thought would bring in the emotion and also the sadness of the story with it and darkness of her having cancer. And also Gorr the God Butcher! Wow I was so excited for him to be in it and Christian Bale playing him was also exciting for me! This movie was fun, it was really fun! Fun isn't always enough. The movie was way too fast paced and didn't flesh out enough of the story. Jane having cancer was mentioned but added up to not too much especially considering the post credit scene, it was a little sad but wasn't really held on in a moment. Thor was alright in it I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, he's goofy and somewhat cool. Christian Bale though... Gorr the ""God Butcher"" himself! He did in fact live up to the name in the opening scene, but then where was the rest of it? Was it cut? The name and the look alone was scary but the actions weren't, no consequences or fear of losing any characters along the way. Gorr was watered down and your just supposed to imagine him killing gods I suppose. And he really wasn't in the movie that much either, they seriously under-utilised Christian Bale and did Gorr dirty. Can't say I was bothered by either of the post credit scenes. It was just fun there's nothing really more to it. Just way too fast paced, even more so than doctor strange which managed to pull it off so either it's the writing or things were cut and the movie should've been longer. Enjoyed it but disappointed so yeah but the style and the colours on screen were really pleasing to look at especially the black and white mixed with colour.","

"r96sk","24 August 2022","As usual for the MCU, 'Thor: Love and Thunder' is a good watch. I did want more from it, though.Chris Hemsworth remains the star of the show, I'm adding nothing new by saying he is just perfect for the role. Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi and Natalie Portman all make for good support. Christian Bale is also someone I enjoyed, I like the look of his character but kinda felt that I wanted to see more of him - it's like we see a beginning and an end, but part of me feels like we coulda had something in-between.The special effects are solid, as is the music; even if the track choices aren't the most creative. I probably would've shortened the run time a little, though that isn't anything all that noteworthy to be honest. There are some funny moments in there, which is always something I expect from a Taika Waititi flick.As for me and my own personal Thor ranking, this - like the 2011 original (also 7/10) - isn't one of my favourites (fwiw, I enjoy 'Thor: The Dark World' and 'Thor: Ragnarok' (both 9/10) way more) but it's still a fun enough time that I'd recommend it.I simply cannot (cannot, I tell you!) believe they didn't just call this 'Thor Four' btw... 💔","

Korg is the narrator and is telling us, the audience, the story of how they defeated Gor the God Butcher.The entire opening plays out with Korg' narration over the top and plays like someone telling you a story rather than action taking place in real time.I don't think it's a wild theory but if I'm wrong this is a very different movie.","

Literally EVERYWHERE.On one hand we have a sad but also beautiful new happening/story surrounding Jane, which really got to me, and I wished they'd kept that realness and sense of honest reality throughout the movie. They didn't..The action scenes are cool and some intense, and the overall cinematic scenery is stunning, like we're use to receive from Marvel. And some scenes are really funny. But here's the problem, cause on the other hand they're trying too got damn hard to be exactly that: funny.It's like they've said: ""what can we joke about next?"" instead of focusing on the story. Instead of taking the heartfelt story they have, and made that the roots of this movie, they joke everything away. Jokes are meant to just spice things up a bit, put a little zing on it, not take over the whole show. This makes the story weak, and most of the story they're trying to deliver in this movie is lost. So why a score of 7?Cause the story between the jokes and orgie-humor, is that good.","

The main focus was on the comedy and action throughout a decent story that went downhill in the final act. It's decent, and Christian Pale (sorry, terrible joke) gives a great performance as Gorr The God Butcher - an interesting antagonist with a great motive. Like I say, the movie had a pretty great start with a solid first two acts. It just goes way downhill after that with a bad ending. Giving it a 7/10 is me being generous.","

I think it has more comedy than Ragnarok, so if you didn't like Ragnarok, you probably really won't like this. But it got some huge laughs (see it with a packed crowd) and I did laugh out loud a few times. There is also some great use of Guns n Roses songs.Of the cast Hemsworth is great, I love this version of Thor, as opposed to one from the first two movies. Bale was superb, he was very creepy when he was onscreen!! Natalie Portman works in a way I didn't expect. I LOVE Natalie Portman, but I never cared about the Thor and Jane relatiinship. I was surprised at how much I got into it and their relationship in this one. Russell Crowe is clearly having fun, but he won't be for everyone. Tessa Thompson is no fun, but that's how her character is written, so it's not her fault. Where was the bad ass from Ragnarok?It's tone is a bit all over, the comedy is so front and centre it kind of takes away from the seriousness of what is happening and it is serious at times.The Jane/Mighty Thor storyline seemed a bit rushed and I'd have liked more Bale, but overall, I really liked it a lot and will be seeing it again.","

Don't expect too much just turn off your brain and have fun, that's not bad but it's sad that it could've been way more than that.Christian Bale was great but he was wasted by giving him very little screen time.Natalie Portman as Mighty Thor was the best part and I still feel like they wasted her.Taika has proven with Jojo Rabbit that comedy and emotional scenes can coexist within the same movie, but with this film there's no time to feel empathy for the characters and there's no room for other feelings rather than laughing.-Spoiler Warning-
I really hope we get to see Jane as Mighty Thor again.","

"AfricanBro","8 July 2022","After endgame, I noticed marvel trailers only use cuts from the opening 15min, so everything after is more of a mystery and I like that. On that note though, I did watch a YouTube video on '10 things to remember before watching Thor' and basically everything it suggested would happen actually did happen, it was still interesting but I would suggest avoiding that one if you're one to look at recaps too.This is definitely the most schmaltzy take on Thor so far, it still kept its comedic and action elements. I love how it wasn't just a hero stuff but more on Thor's search for love and life's meaning. I love how they focused more on the actual action, not just the visuals which is what I felt some of the recent MCU movies did. It was also paced really well, didn't feel too long or too short. Gorr is definitely one of the best MCU villains, I still think Thanos was it, also love how Ultron looked at the internet once and it was enough to convince him humanity needs to go, just funny to me. So Gorr's definitely up there, with a more cognizant villain origin story. And his nickname 'The God Butcher' is so badass, I love it.One thing I didn't like about the movie is that there were slight inconsistencies in strength/power levels, Gorr would clearly have the upper hand and in an instant one of the Thors or Valkyrie have him fleeting, like you were whooping their ass 2s ago, wasn't too concerning though. The girl playing Gorr's daughter had terrible acting though, but she's just a kid so if she is coming back hope she does better. The scene sequence at the gods gathering felt too comedic for me, definitely justifying Gorr's hatred for them, but I thought they could have taken matters a little more seriously. Biggest problem with the movie was it was they tried sneaking in jokes at everywhere unprovoked.Still got a standing ovation at the end which shocked me, it was okay but not that good. For every good moment there is also a cringe one and I think that smudges the movie as a whole. Like the goats were so over done. Had low expectations but turned out better than M. O. M. In my opinion. I thought Zeus was ""killed"" way too easy, barely showed why he was the strongest and wisest god, just circus theatrics. I won't say much on the post credit scenes(2) but they got me really excited for whatever's coming next. I gave it a 7 but it's just about, the good things make me want to give it an 8 but the bad ones make me want to drop it to a 6. There's a good movie somewhere in there, still good enough to recommend watching though.","

The jokes were a little overdone at times, not all were as funny. It's fun but it ain't Ragnarok. The Hulk and Grandmaster added to the success of that movie so in my opinion this one didn't live up to it's former one. Christian Bale was great but not exceptional. The movie hits and misses sometimes but is a solid 7.5 for me!","

"gitapar","25 July 2022","What could have been a poignant story dealing with grief and loss was ruined by too many cheap jokes. Tone it down. Less is more. The soundtrack was underwhelming. Also, Jane deserved better and Natalie Portman is better at drama than comedy. I think the only thing that was good in this movie was Christian Bale. But, because this is a Marvel movie and he's playing a ""disposable"" villain you already know how this ends without me needing to tell you. For shame. Why does Marvel have the tendency to kill of the three-dimensional villains that are actually interesting? They should keep pumping out complex and flawed villains, same as heroes. Otherwise, what's the point? For us to be bored to death? Mission accomplished. Marvel: Please do better.","

"Donki","6 July 2022","Allow me to start of by saying that it's a worthwhile watch at the movies, as the visual spectacle and jokes will keep anyone well entertained during its runtime.So even if I'm giving it a lower rating I can easily recommend it. My rating comes from a place of love towards Thor movies.But I have to address the elephant in the room which is it's jokes. Don't get me wrong, the movie has a lot of very good jokes I genuinely laughed out loud, but the movie was so focused on delivering jokes non-stop that it became a parody of itself.This movie is the definition of sometimes less is more.Almost every moment that had some sort of heart to it is completely buried under a pile of jokes that made these moment completely irrelevant.Taika found a great balance of story and humor with Ragnarok. I mean, almost everyone praised how the humor he injected into the Thor, brought it to a whole new level. Easily on of the best movies of the Infinity Saga movies.So I'm a bit confused as to why they decided to go so overboard with the jokes, that it killed almost every character moment.Christian Bale's Gorr was highly anticipated, as we all know the acting chops he can bring to any project. And he did bring everything one would expect from any character he plays.Thing is ... he's the only one who tried to bring any amount of seriousness to the movie, and was severely underutilized. He was creepy and intimidating. His character had the right motivation for what he was doing. He had everything a good villain needs. I'm not exaggerating when I say that in the almost 2 hour runtime of the movie he was present about 25-30 minutes in total, most of which was in the climax of the movie.So if the main villain of the movie takes a back seat what was this all about? Well, in short it was romantic comedy between Thor and Jane. Emphasis on the comedy part, since the romance was severely overshadowed by constant need to inject comedy into every single scene.There was even a genuine moment for 2 gay characters, that was very well written, and would have worked so well as character development moments, if it wasn't squeezed in-between a major story beat and a returning joke, that overstayed it's welcome, since it was done for around the 6th time at this point.So my biggest gripe with the movie as whole is that it can't be taken serious at any level, as the movie handles itself as parody within the confines and logic of its own universe.","

Thor: Love and Thunder is the first Thor movie in what is essentially the new 'phase 1' of Marvel. There is a lot that needs to be set up and unfortunately Thor: Love and Thunder has to do it's part in setting up that greater story.All in all, it's an entertaining, well executed, movie that I walked out of in a good mood. Given what it has to accomplish in the overall Marvel narrative, I'd say that's an accomplishment. And with the ending that it has, I'm very excited to see what is set up in this movie payoff.","

"frankiesilver-91836","9 July 2022","After the overly-hyped and mostly disappointing Multiverse of Madness, I tampered my expectations for Love and Thunder despite it being a direct sequel to one of my favorite Marvel movies. I was right to do so.The concept already wasn't too great. Mighty Thor is pretty dumb to begin with but Gorr was an awesome villain idea. The Jane stuff didn't end up as awful as expected, but it still felt forced and her being ""a Thor"" is just stupid.They at least try to explain it, but how Mjölnir changes Jane doesn't happen to anyone else worthy. It also just makes Thor and Steve seem less special.This movie degrades Thor enough as is. He went from a humorous kickass god to now acting like a bumbling idiot. He genuinely is a parody of himself. The way the cast behaves doesn't fit the dark plot lines of Jane's cancer and a god butcher.Jane reappearing after being absent in Ragnarok felt weird. Still she looked awesome and this was probably her best appearance. I was expecting her to take over Thor's mantle permanently, but surprisingly she dies instead. I'm thankful they didn't kill off Thor, but Jane's death felt rushed and not impactful.Gorr's depiction by Christian Bale is downright wonderful. He brings his A-game, but we get very little of him. Gorr's suffering could've been fleshed out more and they could've explored the moral grey area of his goal. We get none of that. Instead we only see the GOD BUTCHER kill one god on screen, and they cut away during the decapitation! We see him terrorizing children most of his scenes, which is pleasantly terrifying but they should've done way way more with him. As it is this is a waste of both the character of Gorr and Christian Bale in the MCU.Everyone else gets next to nothing to do. The Guardians understandably leave early on, Korg and Valkeryie just tag along for nothing other than jokes and forced sexuality commnets, Lady Sif returns and is degraded as a character.No one is taken seriously for the sake of comedy. The serious opening with Gorr comes off as jarring because of this.Also the Warrior Three's deaths are made fun of and Darcy only gets one scene.Many of these jokes seem to actively be making fun of pre-Ragnarok Thor content.For a positive, I will say I loved the first act of this film. It was downright hilarious, most likely due to James Gunn collaborating with Taika. The Guardians' chemistry with Thor is awesome. By the time act 2 started I was still laughing out loud throughout, but the jokes made less sense and were either shock humor or unintentional. By the ending of the film I was just depressed at realizing this wasn't the Ragnarok 2 I expected.When you also take into account the shockingly unfinished looking CGI and special effects for Marvel standards you get a messy movie that is funny, but not well-constructed by any means.Ragnarok wasn't just funny, it had a deep, high stakes story behind it. This movie needed to not just be funny but flesh out its story and keep continuity better.This isn't the total miss that was The Dark World, but it's very much under the quality I'd expect from one of the most beloved Avengers.","

"benjaminskylerhill","7 July 2022","Taika Waititi amps up the zany craziness of Ragnarok to unbelievable levels in this film, both for better and for worse. The movie is often hilarious due to how unpredictably absurd it is, but sometimes suffers due to the overbearing need it seems to feel to always have jokes in every scene, regardless of whether they fit in with what's happening in the movie.But, this is nothing new for Marvel. I only bring it up because it happens far more often in this film than in any other Marvel outing.What is new in this film (and quite fresh) is the villain. Christian Bale gives a surprisingly both creepy and heartfelt performances as the God Butcher. Right from the opening we have a deep compassionate understanding for why he does what he does, and the conclusion of the story gives him a very satisfying conclusion for his journey as well.I just wish there was more of him. He gets a great introduction and a great ending in which compelling parallels are drawn between him and Thor, but throughout the rest of the movie he's just ""evil possessed guy."" The motivations are still there, but I wanted to see more of what he was doing and how his possession was affecting his mind or personality.I was worried about how Jane would be as ""Lady-Thor,"" and thankfully her presence in the movie is warranted. She's written into the story in a way that both makes sense and actually amplifies the emotional stakes, which are sadly nonexistent in a lot of these Marvel films.The action is mostly pretty good, but kind of a mixed bag. The camerawork and selective use of colors is fun and frenetic, but the overuse of CGI is sometimes far too noticeable and makes the movie look...cheap. Cheaper than any other Thor movie. Cheap is not a word I like to use when describing $200 million movies, but there isn't a better one to use for this.Endings are hard to write, and the ending of this film (no spoilers) both works and doesn't work. There's a satisfying payoff to the themes of love and loss, but at the very end the story asks us to care about Thor's relationship to a character who we have not seen and know nothing about.It's a sweet and charming ending, but it left me feeling...colder than I think the filmmakers wanted me to feel. And that's because they didn't put in any work throughout the movie to make me feel as satisfied as the characters in the movie are by the ending's outcome.I do recommend this film, for Christian Bale's performance and for Taika Waititi's very distinct (if flawed) absurd method of telling stories with a lot of humor and heart and ambition. A lot of ambition.","

"jddv","6 July 2022","Thor 4 is going to cause quite a bit of division, with some people loving the fast pacing and humour, and others citing a lack of character development with a flippant disregard of true, life-threatening danger.In a way, they'll both be right.There will also be a never-ending comparison to Thor: Ragnarok, with some justification, as TR was Taika's first foray into the MCU and therefore a breath of fresh air; but also with the same reasoning being a caveat that we are a bit inured to Taika's originality now, and thus not as easily impressed.While I agree that the director's penchant for not wasting time on minutiae allows the story to proceed apace, it felt as though the middle of the film failed to allow the antagonist to establish his bonafides as a true threat, reduced as he was to scaring children. Without going into specifics, the ending also nullified his emotional motivation that ""All gods must die.""However, the film makes up for some of these weaker points with imaginative use of powers, props and locations. But you aren't allowed a moment to digest the more serous moments, and end up leaving the cinema feeling a bit confused and uncertain as to whether you enjoyed what you just watched. Hence the division of opinion of those who watched the film, but didn't take more time to digest what they saw.So when you do see it, give yourself a few hours to let it soak in, then decide if you feel it was worthy of your time & money.","

"seige-hound","11 July 2022","Thor Love and Thunder is two movies. The first movie is another Thor Ragnarok, a goofy Taika Waititi comedy with lots of improv and silliness. The other is a dark and gritty story about Gorr's grief for his lost child, and how it parallels Thor's grief for the impending loss of Jane.The issue is it doesn't quite balance that. I'm not sure if that's the fault of Taika Waititi's direction or producer meddling, but either way, the film is a bit 'off'.The good stuff is good. Christian Bale as Gorr is fantastic. He nails the portrayal of both the grieving father, and the corrupted evil mastermind. Jane's story as Mighty Thor is also very compelling. If I could say one thing, would be that she should've been the main focus of the movie, with regular Thor as a side character/comic relief for an otherwise dark story told straight.That, or just save the Gorr story for a later time, and have another goofy Thor comedy ala Ragnarok. Have him hang out with the guardians more or something. I don't know. The problem with this movie is that with the slightly reduced run time of 2 hours, and the inconsistent mix of tones, the film feels unfocused and rushed. Which is disappointing, because of the two stories that it used up (Gorr's and Jane's).","

Also No Way Home's multiverse exploration has skyrocketed everyone's expectations and we kinda want to see something about the multiverse in every Marvel movie now and when that doesn't happen its a bit disappointing.

"Brandon_Walker_Robinson","7 July 2022","Let me preface this by saying that I don't really love any of the other Thor movies. Ragnarok was actually a massive misstep for me. The slapstick comedy made me eyeroll almost every time out, not at all fitting any progressive tone from the previous Thor or Avengers movies before it. After loving Jojo Rabbit, I thought that every Taika Waititi product that I didn't enjoy was some exception to his excellence, but I shortly discovered that that was the only film I did care to love from him. I started to give up hope, especially after hearing Love and Thunder only adds to the silliness that Ragnarok had.I'm here to say that the comedy this time around wasn't as maddening for me. Some of it was legitimately funny or at least served a courteous chuckle; it never interfered with the action, the villain, or serious moments; and I think the majority of jokes that fell flat passed by so quickly that I wouldn't even realize it was an attempt at humor unless somebody said it was supposed to be funny (which is never good, but it's better if it goes without a hitch). The Zeus scene was admittedly worst than the Ragnarok levels of 'bad' and really brought the movie down during the time, but thankfully that was the only time that I really felt the brunt end of failed comedy. There were two other running gags during the film -- one involving certain animals which I laughed at the more they appeared, and the other involving weapons which really didn't work except the first time it happened. They even repeat a bit from Ragnarok that I thought worked more this time around simply because it took place on Earth instead of Asgard. Upon re-reading my own paragraph I feel like I may be giving this movie more credit in its humor than I feel it's owed, but I feel this is all relative when I say: ""At least it's not as bad as expected or as previously established."" I can't see how somebody who loved Ragnarok is only now going to be upset at the knockabout that this movie at times can be.Love and Thunder introduces Jane as Mighty Thor, and although it was great to see Natalie Portman return, the dichotomy between her two selves with no in-between was very jarring. I guess in a two-hour runtime you have to accept these little nuances to be skipped time to time and she isn't the only character to undergo an immediate change like this, but if you're coming off the Phase One MCU character of Jane who you remember you would never believe she would evolve this persona. I guess that's what happens when your character lives on as you take a hiatus from the universe as an actress, though. Regardless, this story is very Jane-centric and I think it is something that Ragnarok was dearly missing. She helps complete Thor, or at least for a life that Thor pines for. There is a backstory montage showing a relationship between Thor and Jane (almost in an ""never before seen footage"" kind of way) that displayed more chemistry between them than either Thor or The Dark World bothered to give off. Like I said, very heartfelt.This actually is a good transition to Gorr, because his origins are also derived from the love of another as well. This movie does that thing that the show House M. D. did (where a patient with a certain quirk delivered thematically for the doctors in the episode), so what was happening with Thor was also happening with Gorr regarding their attachment to the loved ones in their lives. It doesn't play like this for the whole movie, but it is still a present theme. Christian Bale is really good, but I'm not sure if he has enough moments to show this. He both frontends and bookends the film very strongly and shows up here and there with shadowy minions, and he is absolutely a dominant presence every time he is on screen, but I definitely could have had more of him. He is never served as cannon fodder for Waititi's comedy, so his scenes are always serious and impactful. His monologues are very captivating and will get a lot of clicks on YouTube, and the action set pieces with him are very diverse and engaging.I'll restate that Thor never really was my favorite, and unfortunately it could be because he isn't Earthbound. Any time this character is off of our planet, losing that grounded aspect really takes away from it all for me. Never before had I imagined after seeing the first Iron Man film that we would get to a point where we'd have rainbow bridges and rock-bodied aliens, and that can be detracting for me. That said, the Earth scenes here once again grabbed me most (as well as the scenes with the colorless portrayal, you'll know when you get to it) and the off-world stuff did not (especially once again the Zeus scene). When Asgard was destroyed in Ragnarok I thought that was the best thing that could happen to this franchise if it meant more Earth scenes. There are some scenes away from Earth with nice grounded conversation, and these are the moments that almost reminded me of what Jojo Rabbit did so well. Valkyrie was also normalized a lot in this movie and I dug her every time she was on screen because of it.Despite some of the cringe that was afoot, I had a good time with this sequel. Given that I do not relatively enjoy the Thor films as much as many of the other MCU films, I can easily put this above the other three myself. It was a visual delight, the music was well done, the actors all gave good performances, and characters had solid arcs to play out. Furthermore, I like that it was two hours and they didn't needlessly add in other characters which didn't fit this story, even if they were a part of previous Thor films. I won't say this movie completely fuses the humor to my liking for this character, but the movie itself is the best/most entertaining of Thor that I have seen so I suppose I am accepting of it.","

"Top_Dawg_Critic","8 August 2022","Sure it was cheese, but it was Pule cheese, the best there is. I'm shocked how many reviewers can't count past one, because production value alone is worth at least five stars. I really wasn't expecting much with all the negativity, but wow was I pleasantly surprised! Just when I thought the industry ran out of superhero writing ideas, this little gem comes along, and we were all in tears laughing so hard. Even the story-telling narration was a brilliant touch and elevated the plot and the laughs. The entire screenplay had everything and something for everyone. The humor, the romance, family dynamics, and so on, everything imo was perfection. All casting and performances were outstanding. The almost 2 hour runtime flew by with the excellent pacing. The set designs, S/VFX and cinematography were amazing. The score and soundtrack were spot-on. I can't wait to see this one again, as it's now one of my favorite superhero films of all time. If you haven't seen it, ignore the whiners, this is one heck of a fun, entertaining and hilarious popcorn flick. It's a 9.5 rounded up to a perfect 10/10 from me.","

"vibhus-17780","7 July 2022","Eventhough I wasn't much hyped for Thor : Love and Thunder , yet I was disappointed . Major drawback of this movie was trying to keep everything funny and hilarious , even Thor loses throughout MCU journey was potrayed as joke and at end it felt like some spoof , but TBH most of the places comedy worked well , so i guarantee movie never fails to entertain you . Plot was weak and seems like it was exclusive made for children's watch . Huge cast in single movie and runtime is around 2hrs , so everything was jus rushed and felt incomplete . Overall just watch it for fun , don't expect something like Thor Ragnarok .( suma suma ovoru scene comedy , sarcasm , mock panren soli nala scene kuda keduthu vachurukingha le da )","

"aslihanbiyikoglu-103-842075","7 September 2022","I always looked forward for Marvel movies to come out, I didn't watch the trailers to keep the excitement at top, I arranged time for us to go see on the first days, the excitement, the intensity, the enjoyment. Not anymore. My daughter refused to go to Love and Thunder, she kept saying her friends hated it. I insisted and we just went to see it. Such a disappointment.The humor on Ragnarok was cleverly played. Action, story, Chris Hemsworth, excitement was all to the point. But Love and Thunder is like a bad middle school play, it is NOT funny, it is not exciting, it is not even a ""meh"" movie. I found myself regretting paying for the movie tickets. I don't want to watch a loser superhero, I don't want to see overly comics looking outfits, bad hair extensions, great actors doing terrible accents. I don't want stair skipping, skirt holding Zeus. Superhero movies were special because I wanted to feel those fight scenes, the emotions, the fear, the power of the winning. I don't think I rolled my eyes this much in a movie before. Only 3 good things about this movie was Christian Bale, the fighting scene effects at the end and naked Thor. That's it. So upset of the direction superhero movies are going.","

"OnlyAtJMart","8 July 2022","So this had promise. Even though Gorr wasn't comic accurate, Bale did a good job, but the script was bad. With what he ultimately wanted, the whole movie could have been solved with a conversation. ""Hey I need Stormbreaker to have Eternity exchange lives so I can sacrifice myself to bring my daughter back to life, and I need someone to keep her safe. I have the Necrosword, and don't want to do this the hard, violent way."" Boom, whole movie was unnecessary. Also, lots of overuse of Guns and Roses. Does every action scene have to have ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" other than the one time they used November Rain? Plus they bring Jane Foster back, just to kill her off? The visuals were good, but the writing was bad. Very one dimensional. Phase 4 is probably the worst phase of the MCU so far. I really hope they see that it's been underwhelming, and get some better writers moving forward. As a big fan of the MCU, I hate to say all this, but they can do better.","

For me, MCU did injustice to his character, he should have some more scenes. Most surprising thing for me was, I never think of watching Dr. Jane playing as Mighty Thor however,it's amazing to see her playing and carrying on this role so perfectly. And, Thor is usual best to do some actions or comedic scenes whatever he gets.But, sadly, the story wasn't good. So,the artists haven't much to offer though they played the roles so gracefully.","

"newguy85","14 July 2022","I gave Ragnarok a 10 and it's one of the only MCU movies I seek out for repeat viewings. It's stylish, hilarious, balanced, and treats the source material with dignity.I saw the trailer for Love and Thunder and immediately wanted to see it opening night, which I rarely do anymore, but thought this warranted a big-screen viewing.Without spoilers, my opinion of what we got is too much silliness and irreverence and poor writing, pacing and plot in the first half of the movie that dampens the very exciting and fun second half.A very important plot point happens in the cold open in a very fast vision, and multiple plot developments happen off camera, yet we get a multiple moments of on-screen gags like Natalie Portman coming up with catch phrases, Stormbreaker being jealous of Mjolnir, the Zeus lightning bolt show from the trailer, and easily ten minutes of goofy flashbacks narrated by Korg that get old really fast. There are times that it apparent that director Waititi just likes the sound of his own voice (as Korg)As for the acting: Christian Bale's Gorr is the only character that works; Natalie Portman looks out of place and amateur trying to be Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson barely gets a line in despite being King of New Asgard, Russell Crowe's Zeus sounds like Borat and made his scenes unwatchable, and Chris Hemsworth goes full himbo Thor.Where Ragnarok felt like a love-note to comics, Love and Thunder felt like everyone involved believes Marvel Comics and the MCU are undignified and something to be mocked.As for content, if you are taking kids be aware that there is a lot of sexually charged dialogue, a scene about orgies and when Chris Hemsworth is disrobed a lot of jokes about the size of his genitalia.","

"weldingr","9 July 2022","The movie overall was as expected, funny moments by Chris Hemswort as always and great acting by Christian Bale as always. Natalie Portman acted great also. The rest of the cast did what they were supposed to do, to support. So many great moments were clouded by Disney's insistence of show that they are inclusive. Probably like 10 reference of gay couples were made including the stone dude. Yes, believe it. Disney is causing Star Wars and Marvel real fans to get tired. They are more worried about the ""being inclusive war"" than doing good writing and directing. Spider-Man showed that they don't need to be woke in order to do a quality job. I hope Kevin Feige and Jon Favreau get tired and move to DC. There's nothing fresh anymore on marvel.","

"avindugunasinghe","2 November 2022","Love and Thunder's lightheartedness is it's main feature. Sillness of it's somewhat cringey moments are cute and adds an easygoing tone. The plot's shapeless form makes it unpredictable and exciting. Maybe this is the best way forward for certain MCU stories, to make the plot more light-hearted, silly from which the plot has more qualities of a comic book adaptation than a separated entity from it's roots. Visuals are heavenly and that was the golden ticket for this movie. Plot's metaphorical outlook on society is admirable too , there's no genre limitation to remind of reality. Great performances by the cast making the experience a joyous one. Well done.","

"QoS007","16 July 2022","Thor Love and Thunder is probably the biggest Marvel disappointment of them all, and yet again Disney is at the helm of squandering creativity and adventure for bloated CGI, mindless world building, and terrible quippy dialogue.There's not much of a movie to discuss here, but I'll say that engrossing entertainment on the big screen began to dwindle when Disney took over Marvel and Star Wars. Remember what it was like to walk out of a theater beaming with delight over a memorable film? Embrace the nostalgia because that feeling will never present itself in films like this.What a mess, Disney.","

"dommercaldi","10 July 2022","Pros:
1. Christian Bale (Gorr) was incredible. Every scene with him is just utterly transfixing, and he leaves you invested in the character with his intensity and focus.2. The action scenes are energetic and fun to watch. There's also a certain weight to them, which sometimes can be lost via the CGI.3. There are some comedic moments, particularly when Thor (Chris Hemsworth) gets to jest back-and-forth with other characters.4. The horror aspect was well-implemented, and genuinely provided some tense moments.5. Chris Hemsworth gives his usual upbeat and jovial take on Thor. It's clear he's become at ease with the character.Cons:
1. The Guardians feature in the film for about 10 minutes, and then pointlessly disappear for plot convenience. This is especially annoying as they feature heavily in the trailer.2. Most of the humour comes across as if it was written by a seven-year old.3. The movie is tonally confused half the time. It inserts a plethora of jokes, and then tries to ram in a supposed serious moment, only to place a few jokes after said serious moment. It thus makes the jokes fall flat, and the serious moments feel hollow.4. Tessa Thompson's acting is some of the stalest and one-dimensional that I have ever seen.5. A lot of the special effects are distractingly bad. It's incredibly obvious that a lot of the scenes take place in front of a green screen.6. During the final fight scene, Thor conveniently turns the kidnapped kids into essentially mini-Thors. It's bizarre that this ability has suddenly turned up, as it would have come in handy against Thanos.7. Korg is starting to become like the Minions from Despicable Me (2010); funny at first, but is fast starting to outstay his welcome.","

"BrnzReviews","17 August 2022","Thor Love & Thunder was an entertaining movie as far as Thor movies are expected to be, although I felt this movie focused and relied more on the comedic side of things rather than diving deeper into the characters origin. Gorr The God Butcherer (Christian Bale) was magnificent, truly a standout performance. Chris Hemsworth is great at playing Thor, he invests alot into the role as we've seen over the years and hopefully more to come.I'll admit I was skeptical at first in the decision of bringing Jane Foster/Lady Thor back into the mix as her character has had no relevant screen time to the story for many years but I was wrong, she was brilliant. I couldn't help but ponder where Loki was, I was expecting a reunion/ a confirmation of Lokis possible survival for Thor but nothing. I know its all a plan and I have faith it will be incredible! I can't wait to see Thor return on the big screen, I'd highly recommend this one, not the best ever but still very entertaining!","

"pranayjalvi","9 July 2022","Love and Thunder was chaotic, all over the place, messy, filed with lots of weird dialogues and punchline with a not so strong storyline.The film is particularly disappointing given that it's directed by Taika Waititi, the nimbly funny New Zealander who made Thor's previous installment, Ragnarok, a smash hit and generally has a strong track record of mixing tones, swerving from silly to sentimental with practiced ease.The return of a major actor such as Portman should feel compelling, but she's simply part of some busy wallpaper. Bale and Crowe are instead the film's biggest standouts, because they dare to supersize their performances.To summarise, Love and Thunder offers the usual lightning-streaked action and tossed-off gags, but this time, there's not enough heft behind the flashiness.My Rating: 4.5/10.","

"hazelZD16","6 July 2022","Marvel have going downgrade lately. Quantity Over quality? Thats facts. This movie have a potential to be the coolest and amazing thor movie. But turns out its just another overhyped movie with mediocre story. I know this movie just build up for greater upcoming story. But why? Sacrificing a movie with great potential just to make another mediocre movie? Im afraid mcu have gone too far. U can see the quality since iron man 1 and endgame. After that? Nothing. Thor L&T have unstable CGI, Forced Joke, And lacks of depth on storytelling. I can't believe this movie have many plot hole. Like who know heimdall have son? Who know that thor ca lend his power for limited time or forever? Who know what happen to gorr before his daughter died? Or what happen to his race and wife? Why gorr only ask his daughter but not wife to eternity. Or maybe ask his whole race to be resurrected? Or maybe thats not how its worked? Whole MCU Phase 4 is nothing but A ""LOVE"" Story. Almost every movie they put in Phase 4 the main story of the movie is about love and regrets. I wanna know more about gorr backstory but i guess it will never happen eh? Or maybe someday his daughter will tell the story. And i want to know necrosword origin? They dont even tell us about that, just straight to gorr mighty sword to kill gods. Im worried that marvel have run out of ideas for their movies. Like the story for this movie its just not it. Now we come to post credit part. First post credit scene? Zeus told His son ""Hercules"" to kill thor odinson. Which im pretty sure we gonna wait another 5-6 Years just to see him again in theatre. Anyway Welcome to MCU Brett Goldstein (Hercules). Second post credit? Jane in valhalla and met heimdall. If im being honest they should leave this valhalla thing alone. Let the one who died just died. Shouldnt show us they physically alive in valhalla because its just ruined the emotional moment we get from the dead of asgardian. Is Thor L&T Good Movie? No.Is Thor L&T A Bad Movie? No.Is This movie better than recent Mcu movies? Idk
Because they all look the same.Peak performance for christian bale gorr
and natalie portman jane foster. Top Notch performance for both of them.","

"cricketbat","17 September 2022","The Thor movies can't seem to get the balance right. Thor was serious, Thor 2 was too serious. Thor: Ragnarok was goofy, and Thor: Love and Thunder is too goofy. It feels like kids wrote the screenplay. Its tone is wildly inconsistent, the story doesn't make a lot of sense, and they maybe should have cut a joke or two instead of leaving in everything every writer submitted. When screaming goats are the funniest thing about your film, you should probably try some rewrites. I did smirk a few times, and Christian Bale really puts some effort into his character, but this Thor: Love and Thunder mostly fell flat for me.","

Each new movie seems to out do the previous, making it an absolute feast for the eyes and ears. I had a blast watching it and I think it's more enjoyable than the previous Thor movies. None of them are particularly exploring anything deep. What thematics are present are done well, though. Just enough awkward ex stuff, screaming goats.

"becky-92346","17 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) follows Thor as he goes up against a new villain who aims to kill all gods. He enlists the help of his friends, and a new unexpected hero. Unfortunately I really wasn't a fan of this film, and I just ended up getting really bored while watching it!Firstly, the cinematography was fairly decent but there wasn't much to talk about. I really enjoyed the black-and-white that was used in the film, it was tasteful and set an interesting tone. My main issue in terms of visuals comes with the CGI, which I thought was poor and some of the worst we've seen in the MCU so far. I'd expect more, as they obviously had the budget needed.The acting was good, and the characters continue to be as loveable as they always were. Chris Hemsworth is charismatic as Thor, and Natalie Portman really put her all into her performance, however I feel her character was rushed and wasted. Christian Bale was intriguing as the new villain but once again, I feel his backstory was rushed and felt incredibly basic.The humour for this film felt forced, and I much preferred Taika's approach in the previous film, Thor: Ragnarok (2017). This was a shame as I really enjoyed Waititi's previous works. A few of the jokes made me cringe, which most definitely wasn't what I expected.The music was fitting, but Guns N Roses seemed to be almost the only music used, therefore it got old quite quickly and had less of an effect as the film went on. I can't really remember the score, so I feel unable to comment on that.Lastly, the pacing was messy, and the tone was confusing. The film was both fast and slow, but It didn't balance it very well, and the film completely lost tension for me because of this. My biggest problem was that I couldn't tell what tone the film was going for, and the tonal shifts were too often and abrupt.","

It does not live up to the standard of the last Thor movie but sides as one of the better MCU films. Waititi 's iconic humor does not disappoint in this film and is filled with top notch action scenes; Bale's depiction of Gorr the god butcher is impeccable; However the film fails to move the MCU's broader narrative forward and leaves fan asking did this film have any impact on anything and anyone.","

"Carycomic","9 July 2022","If so, I have to say that I was relieved when the attempts at being comedic finally stopped! The attempted pep talks by Hemsworth as Thor were especially unfunny. To paraphrase the late, great Lloyd Bentsen: ""I've heard inspirational speeches by the original Capt. America, Mr. Odinson. And you, sir, are no Capt. America!""I also wasn't amused by Russell Crowe's portrayal of Zeus. I mean, if he was going to adopt a mock-Italian accent for the character, a la Chico Marx, he might as well have used the ancient Roman name of Jupiter!On the upside, I did enjoy the bittersweet reunion with Jane Foster (a.k.a. Thordis). And the flashback narrated
by Korg (a.k.a. The Stone Man of Krona) certainly helped explain why she and Thor broke up in between ""...Dark World"" and ""...Ragnarok.""I also enjoyed the cameo appearance of the Celestials during the hasty exit from Omnipotent City; the Zeusettes' disappointment at Thor having his toga restored; and the arguement between Thor and Axel over the latter's refusal to go by his birth name of ""Astrid"" anymore.*As for the mid-credit cameo ""hinting"" that the next Thor sequel will feature the character of Hercules? Kind of a mixed blessing, as Brett Goldstein boasts neither the musculature of Steve Reeves nor Kevin Sorbo! Plus; if Thor returned to the apartment to read her good-bye note, then Jane definitely and undeniably left first.In short; if you can stand the lame jokes by Hemsworth, go see it. If you can't; wait to download it from pay-per-view so you can fast-forward past the agonizing dialogue of the intended ""humor.""*Nor can I honestly blame him.

So worry less about how not to offend people and be more inclusive, instead worry about how to encourage and motivate them to overcome their weakness and reach their true potential by reflecting a world that is true and in that world people need protection from wars, viruses, incompetent governments, inflation, raising costs of living and so on.","

Too much jokes, I would say that having a lot of people talking and trying to be funny doesn't work. Maybe 2 out of every 5 jokes are funny. Guardians are barely in this movie so don't expect a Thor and Guardian team up.The tone is kinda inconsistent, with serious moments getting interrupted by that tradition ""Marvel comedy."" There is no real threat, Christian Bale is great but all he does is say stereotypical evil villain monologues. His fights scenes are good though, I will admit. He has a good backstory but his transition from grieving guy to main villain was lame and quick. It happens within the first 5 minutes. One second he is a normal guy, the very next he suddenly changes his looks an is now a super villain.Natalie Portman and Tessa Thombson are good in this movie, and they get almost as much screen time as Thor. I would say the ending involving a battle with kids and shadow monsters was kinda lame, it suddenly turns into a little kids movie. Seriously, it feels like a (ahem) ""Disney movie.""Overall this is a good action movie with great effect and some good acting, but if you are looking for some deep story or stuff like that, it ain't here.7/10.","

When every single line is played over-the-top, they all lose their impact. Subtlety would have gone a long way with him.The other thing about the comedic beats -- most of which completely fall flat -- is not due to the actors' delivery but the directorial choices of how the scenes are shot.Even the Guardians of the Galaxy, who can usually be counted on for solid humor, came across poorly in this.A better edit might have made this more enjoyable, but not by much.

And yes, I'm looking at you Taika Waititi - it may be time to hang up your pen! This movie has some good talent in it, so it's a shame they were treated like idiots with poor dialogue, too many bad jokes that fell flat, and a plot that needed a major overhaul.Fat Thor turns into buff Thor and gets his very own nude scene - but relax ladies, he's only shown from behind. There were so many bad lines and lame jokes that I can't even pick out just one, but hey, at least Thor got to play a caricature of his former self!Smart Jane Foster turns into cancer ridden Jane, who then turns into Female Thor. Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, which was crushed to pieces by Hela, becomes whole again and is instructed by Thor to protect Jane. Apparently Mjolnir didn't understand and instead turns her into Female Thor whenever she picks up the hammer. Jane has new strength and hopes that a miracle will heal her. Unbeknownst to her, the hammer is actually drawing her remaining strength out, leaving her body unable to fight off the progressing cancer. Thor and Jane rekindle their love, only to be separated permanently by Jane's untimely death. Also, it looks like Jane became more godlike than human, because she joins other dead Asgardians in Valhalla.The Guardians of the Galaxy make an unremarkable appearance at the beginning of the film, but they are totally ineffectual until Thor shows up and saves the day. Say goodbye to the Guardians.Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) turns into King Valkyrie instead of Queen, without any real reason given. She's not given enough to do and is rather a wasted character, which is a shame.One of the better characters is Gorr (Christian Bale) who turns into the ""god butcher"" after being chosen by the Necrosword, and sets out to kill all gods. He also isn't given enough screen time and also becomes a wasted character.Funny rock guy Korg turns into the unfunny and annoying ""Jar Jar Binks"" of this movie. (writer/director and voice of Korg, Mr. Waititi makes sure to give himself plenty of dialogue) I found myself just wishing Korg would shut up and die, but even after being reduced to rubble, his dang face remains in one piece and he can still talk! Later on he appears to have ""regrown"" himself and he's back in one piece.Zeus (Russell Crowe) can't decide if he's an all powerful god, or just a simpering weakling who picks up his short ""skirt"" as he sashays down a few steps. I guess he was just showing off his ""feminine side"". Thor called him the most powerful god, but they cast an out of shape, flabby Crowe to play the part. Crowe also assumes the most atrocious accent and ends up sounding like a Greek mafia king, who turns out to be neither a strong nor benevolent god.There also seemed to be a lot of confusion as to who or which weapon was the strongest. First it's female Thor and her hammer, then it's male Thor and his axe, then it's Zeus and his golden lightning bolt, or it's Gorr and his Necrosword. In order to blur the lines between all of them, the movie used darkness, shadows, and a whole lot of CGI for the fight scenes so it didn't matter anyway.Disney continues to further its ""anything goes"" stance by bringing out how Korg had 2 fathers who got together and produced him. Then there's Valkyrie who admits to loving another woman, and let's not forget how everyone was invited to a giant, fun loving orgy by Zeus. It seems the mighty Zeus would rather use his strength for lots of sex, rather than save a bunch of innocent children from death by Necrosword.This movie had so much potential but it never lived up to it. I love the Marvel Universe and all its characters. They deserved so much better than this mishmash of tripe. I really wanted to like this movie, but felt let down on every level. Shame on you Disney. I'm sure Stan Lee is turning over in his grave.","

"Mayhew18","9 July 2022","This is by far the most disappointing movie experience of my life. I love Marvel. Except for the Eternals, I've loved every Marvel film, even Thor 2. This film however was an embarrassment and really tough to watch. 15mins in I wanted to walk out but I was in the middle of a row.Thor has become the unfunny village idiot and everyone else just reprised their roles for an easy paycheque. It had so much potential to be epic, especially with Jane coming back in as Thor. But there was zero Marvel magic to it, and her story was completely overlooked and rushed.Bale was the only worthy thing about this monstrosity, but his character and performance were completely wasted.Don't bother seeing it until its free on Disney+, and even then, make sure you're drunk so you don't remember it the next day !!","

Love Hemsworth but now he really is just taking the piss.Waititi should stick to his TV comedies, which I love, and leave superhero movies alone. He has literally lost the plot. 🙄","

"cinistersynthicate","7 July 2022","With review I'm going to try and not speak about anything to do with comic book accuracy, mainly because in short you can definitely throw any of that out of the window with this movie, and instead I am going to just focus on the film itself and why I don't like it. First of all I just want to say that Thor Love & Thunder is the first ever comic book film I watched where there felt like there was nearly zero at stake. The tone of the movie is just so all over the place, the dialogue was something that my 8 year old nephew could come up with, the story seemed good on paper but was not executed well and that could be because there might be a lot of things removed, the pacing just made me feel like I was watching this for almost three hours when in all reality it was among one of the shortest of the Marvel films. Wrap up all of these issues into one big bow and you got a product that feels like actually two separate films in one movie. I briefly scrolled through some of the other reviews on here and saw plenty of complaints this time around on Thor's personality, and how he's just in a full on idiotic form. In recent years, I have been feeling very strongly about this matter and it is in full effect within Love and Thunder to the point that it is blatantly obvious. As someone who did not care for Ragnarok I was not expecting a majority the humor to resonate well with me, I wont lie and say it was totally and purely awful, I think Waititi definitely nails the Guardians of the galaxy's humor well, not as much the Thor humor though. I didn't find most of the jokes in the movie funny and I think its safe to say that it appeared that my screening did not find most of the jokes funny either between the friend I attended with actually expressing to me he felt like he was almost ""forced to laugh"" at many of the jokes and the lack of the audience expressing a sign of laughter on most of the jokes. As it is, for whatever reason it may be, the runtime was restrictive enough as it was in a movie with a lot to accomplish, If only more time was focused on developing certain plot points, relationships, characters (especially Gorr the not-so-God butcher), and adding necessary details instead of focusing what joke they could nail next, I believe the impact that the audience was supposed to feel walking out at the end would have been greater, made more sense, and maybe even I would have liked it more.","

"awarlock-17703","14 July 2022","I was a big Thor fan as a kid in the 70s. He's a buffoon in this movie. They made this franchise into a comedy. Very disappointed. If I watched this back when I was a kid, I wouldve cried.The writers of the movie should sit down ad watch all the '60s cartoons to get a grasp of the character ""Thor"". Maybe then, they'll get it.","

"rafaelcastrogarcia","14 July 2022","So... sure all the infinity saga was awesome... mostly and we were all excited for what was to come. But come on! This saga should've ended on endgame. You are just trying to make more money without any more hard work, this film made no sense as Spider-Man NWH did, as Eternals did, as BW did and as DS and all the series that are just annoying I mean you spend 2 -3 hours tops watching one of these movies... but a series? Really? These stories are just empty and dumb at some point. If Thor was able to just transmit his powers to anyone... why didn't we ever see this? Why he didn't do that during the last stand with Thanos so all the Avengers were OP? Now Infinity what the hell... I mean if this thing existed why never mentioned it? Why when he got his new hammer on IW instead of going to Wakanda to do nothing or at least help Tony... why didn't he go to infinity and asked for Thanos to forget about the stones. Why does Greg or Gorr or whatever his name is wished for her daughter to live if he knew how crappy was everything and either way he was going to die he wouldn't be able to be with his daughter cause now she's alive and he dead. You dumb Greg, I mean why bring his daughter back to life? Why he didn't say that Jane's cancer get deleted so she could be with Thor why would Thor care about that kid whom by the way is a terrible actress her dad dies and she couldn't care less. And finally Jane Foster or whatever what the hell this story felt really forced in order to introduce again Jane Foster just for her to die. I mean... why?The story is just dumb and empty just like all these Fase 4 movies.","

Very enjoyable Thor despite anything Love and Thunder is epically entertaining should be praised a fair amount. Well directed fun Marvel experience that has the right elements a bulk of the time! Has an amazing soundtrack that flows well with everything especially the glossy colorful scenery. I understand the hate as well but there's a lot to enjoy.","

"gorair-45579","7 July 2022","Though the movie had so much potential but sadly it became a mediocre parody .just disappointing. Only positive thing is gorr's presence.otherwise whole movie didn't stood up to the expectations.it's even below then Ragnarok.probably 2nd worst thor movie after The dark world.One of the biggest disappointing thing is the pace & Runtime movie needed 2hrs 30 mins time for establishing the characters with the story. Everything Just feels rushed.Another big negetive aspect is thor is known for mind blowing & goosebumpsy fight scenes but this movie didn't have any single moments like that.It should've been little dark & serious story telling rather than a cheap parody.","

"BandSAboutMovies","9 July 2022","This is a movie of weird inconsistencies and you're either going to be forgiving or you're going to hate it. Or maybe you're a Marvel fan and will just love anything they put on screen. I'm predisposed to enjoy comic book movies because I remember an era when all we got was Ron Ely as Doc Savage -- and we liked it -- and fake Iron Man TV movies like Exo-Man, so I always wonder when people dislike these movies for reasons -- that I'll get into -- it kind of makes me wonder how filmgoers went from being so afraid of the train in The Great Train Robbery and then a few years later didn't think motion pictures were dark magic and started saying, ""Oh, this is kind of boring.""Mining the work of comic book writer Jason Aaron -- having Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) gain the hammer and powers of Thor as she battles cancer; Gorr the God Butcher attacking gods throughout time and space -- director, co-writer (with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson) and co-star (as Korg) Taika Waititi has created a movie that is as much about Thor (Chris Hemsworth) seeking his identity as it is superheroics.Gorr lost his daughter and realized he was the last being left on his planet. After praying for salvation to the god Rapu, he discovered that the gods no longer care or hear these pleas. He discovers a weapon called the Necrosword and immediately slays that god, deciding that there's no need for them. You know, kind of like how we have monarchs and leaders who beg so much of us with no return.Thor has been with the Guardians of the Galaxy, who have begun to tired of him and a call from Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander) informs him that Gorr the God Butcher is coming to Asgard to destroy any of the gods who survived. It's intriguing that while Thor took Gorr's arm in their first comic book battle, Gorr takes hers.Asgard has become a tourist spot and Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) has begun to miss the life of combat she once savored, instead being trapped by bureaucracy. Gorr is a threat she can handle more easily than red tape, so she dives into the battle, soon joined by Jane as Thor, Thor's friend Korg, two braying space goats named Toothgrinder and Toothgnasher, and Thor himself, carrying Stormbreaker, a hammer that begins to grow jealous of its owner's old weapon.Gorr ends up kidnapping the children of Asgard and makes his way to find Eternity, the being in the center of the universe that he can ask to end the gods. Thor and his friends head to the Galactic Senate on Coruscant -- err, I mean Omnipotence City. There, they petition Zeus (Russell Crowe) for help, but start to realize that maybe Gorr went on his mission to end the gods with good reason.The movie is, at the end, about the love that binds us to people and defines us more than hitting shadow creatures with axes and hammers. The tone may vary throughout the film, as major threats are joked at throughout the film, a fact that was embraced in Thor: Ragnarok and yet disliked here. I've ever read comments that people wanted the entire film to be like the dark opening as Gorr loses his daughter and I wonder, ""Have they ever seen a summer blockbuster with four Guns 'n Roses songs blaring on the soundtrack?""Christian Bale is what made this movie, playing a role that finds him frightening children and laying powerful gods low. After The Dark Night Rises he claimed he'd never make another superhero film, but his children begged him to be in this. I hope they have the action figure of their dad; he's one of the best -- if not the best -- Marvel Cinematic Universe villains, one that may be more right and devoted to his cause than Thor, whose only cause is his own life for most of the film.I also loved that Korg starts and ends the film almost as a riff on Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, telling the children of the adventures of a legend. His constant fumbling as he tells the tale is actually pretty endearing. And hey -- any space Viking ship that names its bar after Cocktails & Dreams, the one Tom Cruise works at in Cocktail -- is going to make me laugh.Are people tired of superhero movies? Sure. But they're the reason to leave our homes and go see a movie. This is the natural evolution of the summer blockbuster and if big studios could have made a Star Wars every few months, they would have. As for most comic book fans, we get it. We get hundreds of new blockbusters released every Wednesday at comic shops and keep thousands of characters and timelines and alternate realities straight. I just wonder what people expect from movies now and what would make them happy. Honestly, I get the feeling that some people instantly dislike a movie just because they need something to kvetch about. Then again, I'm a forgiving lover of 80s sword and sorcery movies, Jack Kirby and neon colors on film. So maybe I was predisposed to like this.That said -- I never thought that I'd see so many Celestials -- much less one -- in a movie. Yes, I realize they were in The Eternals, but seeing so much of this movie is like reading through old issues of Journey Into Mystery. Sometimes, you just need to enjoy things, find the good and love the feeling of summertime, when movies just want to entertain you.","

"hectordanielbuelna","9 July 2022","Chris, Bale and Portman are at the top of their acting in here. There are a bunch of scenes where they really transmit their sadness, their passion and their hate. I really liked that. There wasn't enough of it, sadly. Disney's sticking to the old Marvel formula of ruinning a beautiful scene with a dumb joke or a funny gag and then looking directly at the camera going ""hahaha did you expect that joke about rocks making babies in the middle of a deeply emotional character scene?"". Horrible.I just didn't like it at all.This movie is made for kids. It was so much better when the movie was in my mind, now that I've actually seen it I'm beyond dissapointed. But I'm finally done with the MCU so hooray! I have zero interest in any of the upcoming movies. So now I can save my money and maybe buy some good books instead.","

"dupregalaxy","6 July 2022","Unfortunately the film itself seems to be quite underwhelming.Whilst the stars and co-stars continue with the similar style of performance as previously seen, the story itself seems to be lacking a drawcard that stimulates the hunger for more. The climax is quite anti-climatic and the cgi in itself seems to be of poor quality considering what we have seen in previous films.The introduction of the mighty Zeus could have illustrated a bit more raw power as opposed to introducing a comic, that could possible be taken out by Hawkeye if given the chance.The light hearted comedy observed in Ragnarok was well balanced whilst not detracting from the story. In Love and Thunder it feels that some of the comedic moments are forced, and that the emphasis of the movie is to create laughs rather than build up the anxiety and tension that you would expect Christian Bale's character to create, or feel any emotion between Thor and Mighty Thor.If you are not in any hurry, wait until the Disney+ release.Perhaps better luck in the next instalment.","

"prbessette","19 July 2022","With such star power and serious acting ability how on earth didn't somebody yell STOP? This isn't working! Write a script worthy of the actors who clearly did their job in preparation for this mess. All the blame for the much anticipated and highly hyped Thor: Love and Thunder lays at the feet of its director/writer Taika Waititi and I can't believe I had to write that. Often brilliant, all I could think of was why he didn't pass if he didn't want to make another Thor movie! I'm actually worried that someone will get the wrong impression that there isn't a story to tell about Thor when I'd pay to see this one again with a good script and with proper use of the available talent. These movies are made for young teens and enjoyed by adults and this turned me back into an early teen stomping my feet and yelling in my head at the screen for the lame jokes, the pitiful use of Russell Crowe, the tragedy of the lack of use of Christian Bale, (he finally has been given the right role to bother with a Marvel movie and you butcher his story?), the very indifferent story given to Natalie Portman to address the situation she is living in, and on and on. Why were The Guardians even there? Another complete waste! How do you manage to waste Chris Pratt and Brad Cooper too? Not to mention the star!! Hemsworth worked unbelievably hard to prepare for this movie and even he was wasted in this nothing burger, poorly conceived and genuinely indifferent direction with no story, certainly not one worth telling, of what could shoulda woulda been THE blockbuster of the summer! WHO LET THIS HAPPEN!! I'm very worried that the wrong people will get the idea that there isn't a Thor story left to tell when this actor, who has basically dedicated his career to playing him and cares every bit as much as Benedict Cumberbatch does about portraying Dr. Strange, won't get credit where it's due because so much trust was placed in the wrong director because he had a hit with Ragnerok. He keeps saying he didn't want to make it again when that's exactly what he did! This story called for a script that took the material seriously, including humour that hit the target instead of lame 6 year old jokes! And mostly it needed the time, that extra 40 minutes given to Dr. Strange, to fully give Gorr the time he needed to show us his rage and anguish becoming the God Butcher, there's never been an actor better qualified to play a character with the depth of this one (think Oscar Isaac as Moon Knight, where was Christian Bale's chance to bring his incredible performance out of the shadow because he was robbed of story time?). And also time to truly let us feel that Natalie's Jane Foster was the love of Thor's life who this all powerful god could do nothing to save? Where was their moment? Honestly Mr. Waititi, I don't think you wanted to make another Thor movie period and you should have been big enough to pass on it or get help when you knew your script wasn't nearly enough to properly serve the characters in a movie that clearly WASN'T Ragnerok but an epic tale which you admittedly said you filled with every single suggestion received by 6 year olds. How could you? How do you sleep? You're the king of comedy in New Zealand but you're more than that, you can be overly silly but you're extremely intelligent and must have known this was headed off the rails early enough to save it from a near complete disaster! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???","

"eddidvd","12 July 2022","I really wanted to enjoy it, but it made me want to leave after 20 minutes. I am actually appalled at the amount of good reviews online. I know the movie is supposed to be light hearted and a comedy, but it still fails in an astonishing fashion. IT IS SIMPLY NOT FUNNY. I was not the only one to think so either. It was really painful to hear the silence in the cinema after most of the supposed ""jokes"". The pacing was terrible as well, with most of the movie not driven by plot points but by what jokes Taika Waititi found funny; some were rehashed old jokes as well. There are good actors in this movie but their characters are stupid and too goofy for us to appreciate them. Thankfully, Anthony Hopkins' character is dead, otherwise we would have heard him tell fart jokes. The dialogue is the worst part by far, with most lines sounding like they were written by 4th graders. Bale is an amazing actor and his character was one of only good things about the movie; however, his ark was also understandably limited and a little superficial. The random cliche cgi monsters did not help the movie either.I would have been satisfied with a simple parody-like superhero movie, however this one failed completely in almost every aspect.PS: I think the movie should be rated somewhere around the 5/10 range but I gave it a 1/10 because of how much I disagree with the current rating.","

"tmcmaster-67512","13 July 2022","Marvel has finally jumped the shark. They have had no idea what to do with their product after Engame. I thought this would have something to do with the multiverse seeing as that's the route they've decided to take but nope, nothing here on that whatsoever.The film is essentially a ""comedy"" but not one joke was funny. I laughed at the movie rather than with it. This movie really pointed out that these movies are very goofy and should be not taken seriously as with older films. The scene with Russell Crowe, I laughed so hard at the embarrassment all these actors must've felt doing it. In front of a giant green screen acting like complete fools to entertain no one.Speaking of the CGI, I'm not sure where Disney put all their money into this because is wasn't for the CGI. Everything and I mean everything in this movie is built In a computer. I'm pretty sure even the hospital scenes with Natalie Portman were in a green screen room. At one point in the first act Thor & Mighty Thor are talking and I swear they digital deaged both Natalie Portman & Chris Hemsworth to make them look better. I know they do this in movies now to get rid of wrinkles and stuff but it was so blatant and distracting I couldn't help but be baffled at what I was seeing. This is by far the worst effects I've seen in a marvel film hands down.That leads me to the action scenes, first of where were they? Whenever someone had to fight I honestly could care less. It was so boring and the villains shadow monsters were completely trash and forgettable. The action is not existent in this. It's really beautiful people standing in front of a green screen improvising every single word of dialog. I'm truly embarrassed for this film.So Thor, he honestly should've ended his screen time after endgame as well along with Ironman & Captain America. I don't see how he fits in the future of the Universe at all. If you were going to keep him around I would've much rather of seen an entire film with him with the Guardians of the Galaxy & working with James Gunn. Speaking of, no one should direct the Guardians of the Galaxy but James Gunn. The scenes with actors from that film are all off with a different director. All the characters just felt off in this movie and that lives and dies with Taika Waititi. Now I like his films, he is a great filmmaker and funny in general but the tonality of this film is just all over the place and he really isn't a great fit for this anymore.Now the only and I mean only saving grace in this film is Christian Bale hamming it up in spectacular fashion. The film was only ever good when he was on screen. Far and beyond the only interesting character in the entire film and he's honestly barely in it. Just a complete waste of his talent.So from here I have no idea what marvel is doing. Their ""storyline"" is all over the place since Endgame. They better figure it out quick because this was just a mess from beginning to end.","

Thor: Ragnarock is my favorite Thor movie, and one of my top five favorite MCU movie, but Love and Thunder is just an absolute train wreck. A total swing for the fences, and a miss. Unfortunately it seems they were swinging for fences which most likely border the Three Stooges Universe, and nowhere near the MCU. Is Love and Thunder worth watching? Yeah there's some entertainment there, but don't go expecting a top notch MCU experience. Lower your expectations a lot. Otherwise you're in for a big dissapointment.","

"dannylee-78082","19 July 2022","This is by far the worst movie in phase IV. I even enjoyed Eternals. While not as exciting, I thought it was a fun watch. But this feels hard to defend.Throughout the movie, Christian Bale gives his best effort to salvage the movie with little impact. Even the origin story felt clunky but it did set the light and comical undertone. I initially thought this was not necessarily a negative - just different. However, my mind began to see the truth of it as the movie passed.The entire trailer was like within the first 5 min. I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with that but it added to more anticipation how the rest of the movie was going to play out, which in the end added more disappointment because it did not deliver. It was good to see Natalie Portman on screen again but she wasn't particularly outstanding in this film. If she's not to return in future Thor movies, I don't understand why she needed to reappear as I feel like Jane's character was assassinated to accommodate the overall comical undertone. I simply couldn't comprehend why she would turn from a career-focused physicist to battle loving warrior. It felt so out of character but poorly explained. I initially thought that the hammer was to cure her terminal cancer but turned out that it actually drains its life force. This was some elementary writing that I cannot believe was approved. There was no sense of logic or buildup and the audience was just supposed to swallow the ridiculous propositions that the movie presented. Furthermore, Jane and Thor's relationship was portrayed so poorly. Their kissing had no emotional effect. They broke up because they got distant and 3 years later, they suddenly have a spark again. Elementary writing at best that surely cannot anticipate mature viewers to appreciate. Valkyrie felt like she was also another victim of character assassination. I even noticed this despite her not being the main center of focus in this movie. She has never felt this light.Overall, the technical aspects also felt lacking. Many have already commented on the low quality CG moments of the movie. I have to admit that I didn't point that out in my notes as I was watching the movie but it did definitely feel visually underwhelming, similar to how Black Widow felt. On top of that, the music and the battle sequences felt underwhelming and that's where I figured that this will be terrible because those are Marvel's strong suits. Not hitting those checkboxes indicates a serious problem.Once the veil of comedy was lifted and the movie started to take a more heavy turn, I still could not take it seriously because the execution felt cliche and subpar. For most of the movie, I had not taken the movie seriously because the tone provided zero weight with its cringe jokes that are supposed to make middle schoolers laugh. The inconsistency in its tone made the movie a little short of everything - not comedy, not action, not drama, not romance not a Marvel movie that we've all loved in the end.For some positives, I found the shadow monsters intriguing. I thought they were well designed, albeit nothing entirely new. I found the screaming goats funny, partially because I wasn't aware of the meme before. I appreciated the black and white tone in the shadow realm. Felt like Sin City for a moment. Bale definitely stole the scene in all of his moments but I am not still convinced that this movie was a good choice for his near-perfect filmography.Overall, I found Thor to be a high budget B movie that significantly tainted Phase IV and (hopefully not) will have a lasting impact on future Marvel projects.","

"fuzzyjj-1","12 July 2022","What can i say.... Weak script, weak acting, pointless use of Guns&Roses in soundtrack, attempts to be funny that aren't funny. I think the actors aren't bad actors, bit they're just not showing good acting in this one but i guess with a script this weak that's a challenge.Gets 2 stars instead of 1 because of the well done special effects.Wouldn't recommend, absolute waste of time. Lasts about 1 1/2 hours too long. Not worthy of Disney imho.","

I thought I stepped into a spoof movie. I was waiting for Mel Brooks to show up. I don't know how the MCU recovers from this. 1. They turned Thor into a buffoon. 2. The Pacing of the movie was terrible. 3. It tried to be funny and failed miserably. 4. Korg is the Jar Jar of the MCU. Every scene with him is as irritating as poison ivy.I also can not believe Russell Crowe signed up for this. Times must be tough.The mid-credit scene was pointless as well. Nobody cares about Hercules.","

"apereztenessa-1","15 July 2022","Thor Love and Thunder is a massive failure. Like Ragnarok, it doesn't take itself seriously. Unfortunately, in this case, the jokes are just not funny. So while Ragnarok carried its audience along through its humor, Love and Thunder fails to do the same, and the audience is left staring at a not funny film that doesn't believe in itself. Soon enough the characters abandon the screen and the worst risk of all superhero movies materializes: all you see is grown-up people in superhero costumes. It's embarrassing for the actors (aren't you a bit old to be wearing superhero costumes?) and by reflection, for the audience.I find that poor directors can hide their weaknesses for so long, and Takia Waititi is one such director. His most famous films, Jojo Rabbit and Thor Ragnarok were generally weak, but went by, disguised in some humor that worked okay. Without that artifice, the gaps of Waititi as a filmmaker are fully revealed in this new Thor.","

Disney once again strikes with its wokeness ruining Thor, making him into a moronic, love struck buffoon while pushing girl power once again. The story was weak, the special effects were so-so, the acting was just bad except Christian Bale who did a amazing job as Gorr.

"thePopcornExplorer","8 September 2022","The multiverse plotlines and the insane success of Marvel these days, has made their content become empty, shallow and a mere eye candy experience.The best word to describe this movie is soulless; a fast-paced story that doesn't allow for the plot to evolve organically, a goof fest of characters that are simple comedic versions of their own selves, terrible jokes, ridiculous scenes (the kids in the final act...) all of it wrapped in decent CGI to make it easily digestible.Taika Waititi did the hardest thing which was to recover a character with a boring couple of movies and making the third one the best adaptation for the character itself and for its place in the cinematic universe, but this second time around he simply over did it, I felt nothing for this film, it's an empty experience with good imagery.If you stay for the credit scenes you will see how pointless the final part of the film is, and it had the potential to do some sort of redemption but it's again an empty gesture... Also, the reason I don't score this lower, is the fantastic performance by Christian Bale (nothing surprising here) and makes me sad that they wasted such a great villain in a movie like this, a great achievement not from the acting department made possible by Bale and Portman but also for the villain's background story, one of the richest I can recall from the MCU.Wasted potential, Marvel and Disney are sitting on their pile of money making this Phase 4 which has been overall very underwhelming, I know this won't happen, but they should either give audiences a break from Marvel or just reinvent the Universe and explore other characters and directions.","

"tpcatoz-90650","8 July 2022","It pains me to write this review because I really wanted to love this movie and I really enjoyed Thor Ragnorak, but this movie just wasn't good.Before going into the movie I was interested in what people were saying about it and saw a ton of people comment on the amount of jokes. They were so right. It felt like there was a joke every 30 seconds. They were barely any serious parts in the movie and in my opinion it really hurt the movie. Marvel usually does an excellent job with balancing the jokes in their movies, but Love N Thunder just over does it completely.Also, why did Endgame make it appear as though the GOTG and Thor were going to be a team for the foreseeable future? The Guardians were basically not in the movie and it was definitely disappointing for me.The pacing also felt kinda odd in my opinion. It felt like it picked up and slowed down and kept repeating this.Overall, I didn't hate this movie but I had high hopes going into it and felt dissatisfied afterwards. The jokes and pacing were big complaints of mine but there was some decent parts to this movie's.","

"ryannoel-84353","23 April 2023","Thor: Love and Thunder feels like an absolute disaster of a movie, taking all the positive aspects from Thor: Ragnarok and focusing on mindless humour.The movie is poorly written and lacks any coherent plot. The screenplay is a mess of contrived dialogue, nonsensical character motivations, and lazy storytelling. The movie attempts to be a comedy, but the jokes are forced and unfunny, falling flat at every turn. Even the action scenes, which are supposed to be the movie's saving grace, are poorly choreographed and unexciting.The performances of the cast are wasted in this movie, with even veteran actors like Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman unable to save it. Hemsworth's portrayal of Thor, which was previously a highlight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is reduced to a caricature of itself, with the character reduced to a bumbling, unfunny joke. Portman's Jane Foster, who was previously absent from the MCU, is given nothing to work with, reduced to a love interest and a plot device.The new characters introduced in the movie are poorly developed and forgettable. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, who was previously a promising character, is reduced to a one-dimensional stereotype, and her role in the movie feels tacked on and unnecessary. The villain played by Christian Bale is a paper-thin caricature, lacking any depth or nuance, he is set up as the big bad however is quite underwhelming despise the efforts of Bale.The movie's visual effects are unimpressive and feel like a step back from previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.The CGI is often poorly rendered, and the movie's use of practical effects is uninspired. The film's overall look and feel are underwhelming, lacking the epic scale and scope that fans have come to expect from Marvel movies.In conclusion, Thor: Love and Thunder is a terrible movie that squanders the potential of its talented cast and adds nothing to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie's poor writing, unfunny jokes, forgettable characters, and underwhelming visuals make it a complete waste of time and money. Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be better off skipping this movie altogether and waiting for something better to come along.","

But Waititi just wants his mark everywhere. From the direction, the narration film screen time. It was just way too much infact piss poor usage.The only saving grace was Christian Bale who could only work with the material he had but worked his cotton socks off, as for Zeus what a lame attempt to use Russell crow in his worst performance as a kebab shop owner and also in a fat suit and honestly embarrassing to put his name to that.Love the marvel franchises but this one is a miss for me.","

Someone must be pulling a lot of strings if he can get funding for a script so badly written.Thor is dumb now btw. The whole movie is a parody of Thor.Thor can give his powers to anyone he likes, so he creates an army of little Thors basically.Also, remember when yielding Stormbreaker was a huge deal? Created by the flames of a dying star-will brake everyone not strong enough to yield it and make him mad?? Yeah...Now everyone can yield it basically. Even a KID!You also have a love triangle between Thor, Mjolnir and Stormrbreaker, which can drink beer now and can be petted....Marvel did it again.

Like really really bad.I have no clue how Taika Waititi, director of Thor 3 (which is one of the best MCU movies) and Oscar-Winning ""Jojo-Rabbit"", could create such a bad movie.So do not get me wrong, this isn't THE worst movie ever, as a standalone it's just a quite average mediocore superhero movie. But this isnt a standalone movie. This is the forth installement in the thor franchise and features well known and established characters, of whom we all want to know how their story plays out after the defeat of Thanos.And in this context, everything, literally everything is this movie is bad. No not bad, horrible. This is a mess, a movie that feels like a badly written fan fiction.There is only one thing that grants this movie at least 1 out of 10 points: Christian Bale.

What was totally off was the storyline.Whatever plot existed was white-anted by alternating weak comedy and melodrama. Swinging repeatedly from serious worlds-at-stake tension to SNL sketches just didn't work and playful, lighthearted cameos by Damon and a rotund Crowe contrasting starkly and awkwardly against dramatic monologues from Bale just added to the WTF factor.Add the innumerable plot holes and the cast must've been as bemused as the audience. Descriptions like drama, action thriller, RomCom and parody can not apply to this plot salad.Morbid curiosity or blind loyalty would be the only things keeping more from walking out on this trainwreck. For me it was mostly the former but I'd tuned out after 15 minutes.In summary, early reviews are correct.Whether it was a whim or a romp for self-amusement, MCU have created a flick to out-Razz DC's WW '84.This is one sequel better not made.","

"chera_khalid","26 September 2023","""Thor: Love and Thunder"" hammers its way into theaters with a 6/10 rating, and I must say, it was just okay. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson deliver charismatic performances, injecting humor and heart into their characters. The film editing keeps the pace lively, balancing action with quirky moments. Its strength lies in its exploration of themes like identity and legacy, and the film certainly doesn't shy away from the over-the-top comic book fun. However, it falters with a somewhat convoluted plot and a sense of déjà vu from previous Thor installments. The music adds a bombastic flair, and the cinematography captures the fantastical landscapes with vividness. ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" may not be the most thunderous entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it delivers a decent dose of cosmic superhero antics for those seeking a fun, if somewhat familiar, adventure.","

The story of gorr is one of hte most interesting in the comics and here, he barely appears, he has 3 scenes of dialogue, a fight scene, the final fight scene and its over, hes dead. Valkyrie and Korg are annoying for me, the do nothing all the movie but to tell stupid jokes and to be gay. Thor while being funny in other movies like Ragarok or Endgame, you felt he still had its serious moments or realization, of growth, etc; but not in this movie, he is pure stupid, all the time he is just thinking in what his next joke is going to be, Jane foster also has the same problems, a character that was serious in previous movies and now is going throught a very serious stage in her life due to cancer, is also only thinking in the next joke to say. Fortunately, shes still the best part of the movie because to a certain extent, she is a little bit more serious and has her moments. But all the movie feels like that, a joke, and the worst part is that they dont make you laugh either, they sometimes tell the same joke over and over until you just cant stand it anymore or is the most stupid joke youve ever heard. On the good things, you could say that the fight scenes are really cool, not on the level as ragnarok, but still OK, the soundtrack is also cool but it has the problem that almost none is implemented correctly, and also the colors and normally the stethic of the movie is cool, with very bright colors and good designs.But thats it, theres nothing more to say I think, the entire movie is just a bad joke that apports nothing and doesnt make you laugh.","

"Jeremy_Urquhart","9 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder may not technically be the worst movie in the MCU, but it's probably the most disappointing. For that alone, I would say that it's probably my least favourite movie from the MCU so far.Taika Waititi brought a lot to Thor: Ragnarok, and it was an MCU movie I really enjoyed, and it took the character of Thor in an interesting, fun direction. Love and Thunder seems like it's trying to capture the same sense of comedy, action, and absurd fantasy, but the execution is off. The cast are all doing the best they can with what they're given, but the writers, director, editors, and all the people behind the scenes seem like they're on autopilot at best, and genuinely uninterested with the whole thing at worst.There were a couple of okay scenes, but even the okay scenes could have been better. For example, there's a good set-up for the villain, only to have that character ultimately wasted. Same for the Zeus + other gods scenes- it's a bit of fun, but it doesn't add up to much.I smiled a few times but there were no big laughs, and a shocking number of jokes fell flat. Sure, the idea of giant screaming goats is a funny one, for example... but the joke doesn't go anywhere, they're not built on, and there's no pay-off. They're just big and loud and that's it. Also... way to waste The Guardians of the Galaxy. They're there at the start, but don't even feel like the real characters; sort of like bootleg, knockoff Guardians. It almost felt like the entire cast of Guardians were being held hostage on the set of Thor 4.Elsewhere, the action scenes are so boring, and this is a big problem with the MCU at the moment. I feel like the only Marvel movie of the past two years that's had genuinely exciting, memorable action was Shang-Chi, and the action scenes here are particularly lacklustre.Also... three times an important character seems to die, only for them to be revealed to be fine. You can do this once per movie at most (even that can be pushing it), but multiple times? No one likes fake-out deaths! And Loki just had his own Disney+ show and was a big part of the first three Thor's... why couldn't he make some sort of appearance? He's just somewhere else in the ever-expanding MCU while Thor 4 is going on- the universe is getting dangerously big at this point.I didn't hate everything while watching it, but I forgot about 95% of this movie right after exiting the cinema. If there's a more disappointing release in 2022 for me personally than this, I'll be shocked.","

I know that marvel is a subsidiary of Disney but Marvel has always had its own style up until now anyway... you notice that disney has started to decide more in the marvel movies.. for example Korg when he tell a story about his two fathers who managed to give birth to a stone (which nonsense, sigh).. This Thor movie felt more like an old Disney movie i saw when i were 9 years old (23 years ago). At this time i was tagged and liked the cool budget effects without noticing how poorly made they were. That's how it was in this Thor movie now 23 years later. There was no context and no serious mission either, I think this was one of the cheapest movies Marvel made and it's made for kids?. The movie felt like a parody of a real Thor movie but the bad thing is that Chris Hemsworth is parodying himself? I must say, however, that the film had a very few serious and good moments that are worth mentioning (NOT).. the whole movie warth a 2a nothing more.","

"MrHomerJay","10 July 2022","Director - Taika Waititi: ""In the moment, you're like, ""This is the greatest thing that anyone's ever filmed in the history of filming things."" And you get into the edit. You're like, ""I still kind of like it."" And then, after about six months of it being in the movie, you realize it was fun on the day but it doesn't have any business being in the movie""Thor - Chris Hemsworth: ""It was Taika at his craziest. Taika, normally, is kind of at an 11, so you can do the math there. He described it as like he'd been given the keys to the kingdom, and someone said, 'Here, if a seven-year-old was making a movie, what would you do?' He said, 'Well, I want to put this in it. I want to do this. I want to try this.' And everything he suggested, I said yes to, and then we had this insane film in front of us.""Story - the core plot of the movie is actually good and has a lot of potential. However the scenes advancing the plot are few and far between, edited to be as short as possible feeling rushed. Each plot scene is then undercut with a comedy scene that immediately follows. Serious plot points aren't given room to breathe the way they were in Ragnarok. This movie plays like a clown dancing at a funeral.The worst issue is that the comedy doesn't work like it did in Ragnorok. Taika Waititi appears to be a one trick pony like M. Night Shyamalan. He doesn't evolve, he just gives you more of the same. All of the comedy is basically ""look at this random thing"" e.g. The goats bleat dozens of times for a supposed laugh. Just like Shyamalan, Waititi inserted himself into this movie. His character Korg unlike in Ragnorok is now one of the main characters present throughout the plot.Performances - The performances were good. Chris Hemsworth literally embodies Thor, Christian Bale is amazing and plays a complex and sympathetic character (too good for this movie). The rest of the cast does a good job as well.Visuals - Overall the best way I can describe them is a supersaturated rainbow splashed all over the screen. Visuals however are poorly done. The movie uses new tech that projects the background behind the actors. Problem is that in all the close up shots, it looks exactly for what it is. Actors appear in the foreground superimposed on the environment. Try watching the trailer in slow motion, you'll see it. Overall it's underwhelming for a modern movie and disappointing for an MCU oneOverall - This movie commits the worst crime of all: it was boring. You can't invest yourself into the story as it's constantly uncut by jokes and you can't enjoy a comedy since the jokes don't land, seemingly targeted at very young audience.Unfortunately I have to give this 1/10 judging by the MCU standards.","

Spiderman no way home is overrated generic movie only carried by nostalgia, other Peter parkers and villains. Doctor strange 2 wasnt good as expected. Black widow and eternals were bad. And now this Thor 4 did not meet expectations. Not good as Ragnarok.","

"theincrediblehong","25 July 2022","Each Thor movie keeps getting worse. My wife actually convinced me to see this one as she loved the first Thor and was excited to see Jane as Thor (and because fat Thor is gone). But even she hated the movie. Jokes weren't funny, too much profanity for a ""family"" film franchise, mentions of orgies and gay rock creatures? Bale was actually a pretty awesome villain but it's wasted on this joke of a movie.Really, after Endgame it seems like Phase 4/5 MCU films' first priority is pushing minority characters and progressive ideologies at the expense of entertainment and good storytelling. What a shame.","

"VisionThing","16 July 2022","I loved Thor: Ragnarok. I thought the humour in it did a great job counterbalancing the really dark subject matter (destruction of Asgard); the humour enhanced the film. I went to see Thor: Love and Thunder giddy with high expectations, but was immensely disappointed.The quality of writing in LaT in comparison to its predecessor is like particularly sordid fan fiction by someone who completely misinterpreted what made Ragnarok so great. (It's worth noting that Taika Waikiki did not write Ragnarok, only directed it. And none of the screenwriters from Ragnarok were involved in the making of this film.)There is no real plot. Dialogues are horrid, chock-full of very forced out-of-place elementary school level ""humour"". Directing, editing, and even a lot of the CGI feel like rushjobs. Most acting is bad. The only one who seemed to put real effort into this was Christian Bale, who unfortunately has very little screen time.To sum it up, Love and Thunder is an astonishingly bad movie. It is nothing but a cavalcade of bad jokes, pointless meandering, glaring plot holes, and degradation of the character that was Thor.","

Yes. Its worse than the dark world.I dont know what happened, everything was too short, massive decisions made no sense at all, there was an absolute hampering of the quality of this film to make it the shortest mcu film to date.I love taika waititi, i loved his vision for thor in 2017, but for me this was a total bust and it was unbelievably disappointing.

The collapse of MCU started with Spiderman trashing the set timeline, but whatever, I thought, well, take individual movies, sometimes.Still, however bad Endgame was, it at least carried an overarching narrative. What is the thing holding all these movies together anymore?But ok, whatever, individual movies.Well, ALL of the P4 films were simply: bad. Patheticaly bad waste of money. But what do I know, right? Profit is profit, even if the planet will burn down because of it, right?Then somehow this Genderswapped Thor sparkled my interrest. I looked at the poriginal story, and it looked magnificient. Ethan Hawk's character looked excellent in the promo. I didn't mind Cartoon Thor. I was ok with Natalie Thor (Nhor?).But Nhor joking all through the film, even in hooman form, not even a shadow of cancer, and suffering, and everything this story is about?

Half of this movie is crap and poorly made attempts at comedy. The might Thor has been reduced to a stand up comedian with poorly written jokes. The concept of Gods and Asgard have been made to look like Disneyland.Overall, avoid watching this if you can. It's just a waste of time.Also this requirement of 600 characters is stupid.

I came back later to try and finish and gave up a second time out of boredom, and DNF gets an automatic 1 star.The film itself deserved maybe 2 or 3 from what I saw.Thor is finding himself for the third time in 3 movies. He's millennia old and has to 'find himself' 3 times in 8 years. What a loser.Then boredom happens, the screaming goats are funny for 2 minutes but it drags on for ages and is so repetitive the gag gets really old really fast.It has no time to breathe, the themes are love and loss and death and terminal cancer and inevitable loss, but there is a cheap gag every 30 seconds so we're not supposed to care at all about any of that.This is a film which seems to be aimed at, and written by, a 7 year old with ADHD.","

Pump a hundred million into special effects and hope that will compensate for major holes in plausibility.Every film now requires at least one character's death. Good chance they will pop up alive again in some later film, but for now that can wring some pathos out of the viewer.Speaking of deaths, didn't some of these kids die in battle. Bodies were being blasted apart and thrown all over. Maybe at least a broken bone or two. Yet when reunited with their families not a scratch.Finally what's the deal with Russell Crowe's Zeus?

"kosmasp","10 July 2022","Round two ... my internet really pulled one on me. I had the complete review written and then it ... well it went away. So from the start - and probably a bit different than the other review I wrote. A bit like the Thor you get here. Taika reinvented him for Ragnarok - and he even went further with this installment.You have to dig what he does - and his humor too of course. I understand that some do not like the humor. You can't fault the movie technically speaking though. Ask (your) kids - maybe you got a bit weary, but they surely haven't. And the darkness that Christian Bale brings to his role (great as always of course), will not faze them either.Bale who gets introduced first in the movie. Might be a (new) trend for Marvel. Giving us the bad guy, before we see the good guy(s). Moon Knight did the same (Ms. Marvel did not of course), but let's keep an eye out for that.Bales character is not alone when he gets introduced. There is someone with him. And while you may want to forget about it. Bale will not let you. He will keep talking about that character - so much so, that you may get a bit annoyed. But there is a reason (or two, no pun intended) for that.Everyone except Bale can show off their silly side. Adding a bit of gravitas from time to time. But the darker tone and mood is kept for Bale and his character. He may not have much screentime, but the movie called Thor (whoever that might be - you probably have seen the trailer so you have an idea I reckon).But apart from reintroducing characters to us, the movie is also reintroducing the Thor (movie) mythology to us. So if you or the little one you are with or whoever have not seen the previous movies, you get a ""what happened"" at the beginning. Not everything will be rehashed. There is another flashback kept for later in the movie.This is the fourth Thor movie and aside of Hugf Jackman as Wolverine, no one has played a comic book character as long as Chris Hemsworth has. And the latter has gone through quite the transformations. I understand if you are not into the humor.I myself had an issue with another character (that you may already know is in the movie). The portrayal and the accent seemed weird to say the least. But even though I had my own preconceptions about that ... I'll call it character, I understand that Taika only wanted to do his thing. I did not know he was part of the Marvel comic book cannon to be honest, but I am not as involved in the comics as others are.So while there is not much story here (getting from point a to b and all that), there are a lot of cool set pieces. And a lot of weird (Taika) humor. Like him expanding the God universe if you want to call it that. Which is sort of the scene I was talking about above.It all makes sense in the end though and for me the balance between silly and drama did work. You have to suspend your disbelief, maybe drink a little bit of that kool aid and just go with the flow.I for my part am happy Thor is back. At the end of Avengers Endgame, no one seemed to know (apart from Kevin Feige probably), if any of the surviving (and available, no pun intended to the ""old"" man, who passed on ... well you know what) characters would return. So seeing Thor get into the Guardians of the Galaxy ship really made me hope he'd return. I thought it would be in a Guardians movie, but it's them who were in this ... at least for a little bit. A funny little bit that is.And then you have the end credits scenes. People should be aware of them, but still some get up and leave. As with most MCU movies (minus Endgame), you get some bonus and look into the future. One scene during the credits and one after ... both are promising and really great to say the least.So sit back, relax and let the (mostly) lightness wash over you ... it would be a shame if you couldn't. I just had to laugh, because there is a moment where Thor is naked. You don't see a front shot of that, but you do get to see his behind ... uncensored, if that means anything to you. It's another joke and it does work quite well too (no pun intended).Edit: almost completely forgot a few important things. One thing I am surprised by. Well the non reaction from people who are into religion (no matter what kind) that is. Because the movie essentially is critisizing almost everything about religion. It does make fun of Gods ... no pun intended. This is more than the silly depiction of Thor. This is kind of an atheist ... well heaven (another pun I know). It is underlying, but it is not subtle to be honest.And of course the music - Guns N Roses for the win as some might say. Music apparently played a big role during the making of the movie. And if you don't mind classic rock as I reckon people would call it now ... well you could do a lot worse.","

Despite being trapped in a wildly generic villain arc, he does wonders with what he's given!Natalie Portman too is a good bit of fun, perhaps for once enjoying herself in these movies.Within her newly dubbed role as Mighty Thor she conjures up more than a few surprises to justify her character's radical turn.But this is Hemsworth's show and he's a man who loooves any spotlight where he can be as absurd and against hero-type as humanly possible.Taika Waititi, no slouch either in the out-of-his-mind department, aids his leading man's every whim and throws curve balls left and right (to Hemsworth and the MCU in general).Yet, despite the two's almost transparent attempt to push things beyond the scope of reason or...taste, Thor still comes out the other side with hero statues firmly in check.And you can bet that's no accident.","

I hate basically everything they represent and the main producer behind these films, Kevin Feige, is the literal demon that ruined cinema as we know it. He represents everything wrong with the film industry.This film is the same old garbage repackaged with some new fun ideas. For starters, yes I laughed quite a bit during many moments. You can definitely enjoy this film purely from a SNL skit perspective. Also some of the ideas Waititi plays around are fun and enjoyable, such as the 80s inspired rock-costumes and the designs of many aliens. The score and soundtrack are really well implemented.However aesthetically this film is one of the worst offenders. Rarely have I seen this much bad CGI in such a big film. The action ranges from ok to atrocious. The shot language is extremely bad and stale, not a single ounce of dynamic and movement. Just basic green screen single shots and reverse shots. Where's the ingenuity of ""Hunt of the Wilderpeople?"", it all looks so fake and textureless. Gave me Robert Rodriguez mid 2000s green-screen movie vibes, but without the charm.Every scene taking place on earth in an interior set is one of the most bafflingly looking things I've ever seen.","

If you took out Christian Bale's performance ""Love and Thunder"" is more akin to SpaceBalls than any Marvel movie. The ""comic relief"" feels painfully forced and it gets old quick. There was a lot of potential here for a fun Thor movie but it came across as more silly than anything else. The plot was there but the script seemed like it was written by a 14 year old who likes fart jokes. It could have been worse but it also could have been a lot better.

This film was hot garbage and felt like a parody of the Thor series while checking all the politically correct boxes in the process. For starters, there was not a lot of action and the humor was forced and really not all that funny. Secondly, nobody asked for Thor to be humanized. There is a scene where he is wearing an apron and flipping pancakes with his daughter at home. It's that bad.Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) enters the picture, is suddenly dealing with a terminal cancer diagnosis and becomes ""The Mighty Thor"" (complete with powers) to the delight of feminists everywhere.. Russell Crowe's Zeus was a waste of airtime and the villian wasn't really all that intimidating.If Marvel wants to have another good film under their catalog, then they should find a way out of their contract from Disney because they (Disney) are destroying what once was a great franchise along with pretty much everything else these days. With that said, Bob Chapek can add another failure to his expanding list of movie flops this year. Love and Thunder misses the mark and isn't simply worth the time and money spent.","

This film seemed like a journey the characters just had to go through and everything just seemed so right.The acting in this movie is exactly as amazing as you would expect it to be with such an amazing and talented cast. My personal favourite performance was Christian Bale as Gorr, who is undoubtably one of the best mcu villains so far. Not only did he seem perfectly reasonable at all times, but he was also scary and intimidating.The cinematography is beautiful and sometimes even unlike anything I had ever seen before.Taika Waititi once again made Thor magical and proved us just how beautiful his way of storytelling is.All in all, this movie is so much fun and emotional and the closest to perfection a thor movie has ever been. This is for sure one of my favourite films of all time!","

"optimus_spbla","9 July 2022","Thor Love and Thunder seems like a kids movie based on the sophomoric humor and childish behavior, yet is full of sexual references, talks of orgies, and full-on nudity. It's as if they created a movie they new would attract kids and then filled it full of inappropriate sexual content... groomers. Also, the hypocrisy was glaring - we see women ogling Chris Hemsworth's nude body when placing Natalie Portman in the same situation would have been called misogynistic . How about you leave it out all together, there was no need for it. The shame is there was a heart of a good story here with Jane and Thor, too bad it was ruined with Disney's anti-family/pro decadence agenda. Disney seems determined to run itself into the ground.","

"williegannon","11 July 2022","I think everyone would agree that Thor: Ragnarok was the best Thor film by a good distance and one of the best Marvel movies.Thor: Love and Thunder is a very, very poor follow up. The Avengers: End Game restrictions on the narrative of Ragnarok have been removed and it seems that Taika Waititi has been given full creativity for this shambolic follow up.Awful humor and poorly placed jokes litter the film. Shoddy set pieces, terrible CGI and a really bad story ruin this follow up. More so when you compare it to the last Thor film.The film is filled with forced McGuffins from the first minute as the A to B story is forced from point to point. There is no jeopardy in the film whatsoever.Considering that the Gorr the God Butcher run and the Jane Foster run are considered seminal in comicdom, this film has done more damage to Thor on and off screen than if it hadn't been made at all.Actually, the best thing about the film is the soundtrack. And they didn't even get that right with a handful of Guns and Roses songs and not even a mention of Lady Lightning by Bang Camaro. Probably because its on the Peacemaker soundtrack.Actually, go watch that instead.","

When Gorr crawled out of the oasis pond it and was so obviously fake grass over a plastic tub on a soundstage, my stomach dropped. How did the LED panels look so convincing in the Mandalorian and so fake in this? I felt like I was watching a role playing video game.Bale is a great actor, but wasted in this part. His character was not menacing at all. He just shows up in a mass fight and starts sword fighting? What?The Thor and Jane relationship retrospective was painful to watch. It was just plain dumb and juvenile. There was no hint of a real connection to be rooting for.This wasn't a standup routine, but it felt like it. How about a few great, well-placed jokes instead of throwing everything at the wall and see what sticks.I confess I didn't see the end, because I fell asleep! After this I'm really scared of what Taika will do to Star Wars. Please, no more improvising!","

"justriffy","11 July 2022","I love Marvel and Thor is one of my favourite characters! I enjoyed watching Love and Thunder but as I was watching this I could see problems with the film! If this was a DC's attempt at a film, I would have accepted this but Marvel have done so well with the previous phases that you think this phase would be amazing!As the film started with Gorr (Christian Bale), I should have felt his pain but because the script was bad it felt rushed, the scene was a disappointment,
Then comes in Thor, who seems to not care and just isn't with it. Instead of building his character, so that he cares, they throw him into a rushed situation! They could have maybe changed this and he meets Jane Foster on her death bed and when he loses her to cancer that probably would have been a strong reason for him to find his way back to being the hero he is. The whole film felt rushed and felt more like an episode. I didn't mind the comedy aspect to it but did feel like they did try hard on this aspect, when the writers should have spent more time on the storyline. Gorr felt more like a subplot and was underused, Jane and Thors love story was more the main plot which should have been more of a TV series.Gorr was meant to be this villain that everyone is scared off but never really felt it as Jane who has never really fought before is taking him on whereas a god that has more experience in combat lost her arm to him,Christian Bale and Russell Crowe were amazing! Chris Hemsworth as usual is Thor! Just hope the next film doesn't have this writer and director as this film was not what I was expecting!","

I wasted time watching it. The MCU unfortunately doesn't feel the same anymore. The original comic book story is a dramatic piece. It feels like they replaced the drama with weak comedy to set it as the base for the movie,
then tried to garnish it with drama. I would've preferred it the other way around. There was way too many jokes in this movie and I just don't even see the reason to even have Korg in this movie. He was just there making joke after joke. The ending fight acne when Thor gave all those kids the power of Thor and the kid with the stuffed rabbit having lightning shooting out of its eyes. I was just annoyed of this movie for me it's like a 4 out of 10. Recently I have felt that I am experiencing what everybody calls superhero fatigue. The last two movies, doctor strange and Thor were moderate at best. I did not enjoy myself as much. The movies seem adequate at best, the characters felt cartoonish, the story was not engaging and I found myself yawning quite a lot. Especially Thor was really disappointing. After the widely popular and fun Ragnarok, this venture was surprising in the sense that the same cast and same director could produce such a joke of a movie. I did laugh in the movie but that was a pity laugh and I was laughing at how bad a movie could be. Many believe that it was not as bad. I myself felt that I wasted my money. I did not enjoy the movie. The superhero movies are not the same. I find myself falling out of love with these kinds of movies. I think I do not have the heart of a 10-year-old anymore. I have grown I guess. I love the mature content. I love something that I could relate to. For instance, I love the boys. I love the Zack Snyder iteration of superhero movies. They have a heavy tone and contain mature content that I can resonate with. The fart jokes are not funny anymore. The audience has grown along with the movies. After such heavy movies like endgame and infinity war, going back to silly things are idiotic on the part of Marvel. Finding a balance between what you cater to the mature audience all the while keeping the children interested is the trick and Marvel should learn better to walk that fine line. But as things stand they are leaning over to the side of making small children happy. Thus, the reason for people's low rating of recent movies. Superhero fatigue is real and has caught up to me. I don't think I will see any of the Marvel movies unless they promise something new and mature.","

The lore of these characters is completely abandoned, particularly Tessa Thompson's character who was a force in recent Marvel movies but has been reduced to a cliche in this. It felt like an episode of FRIENDS with the schlocky zingers coming at you one-after-the-other. All it was missing was a laugh track, I swear.Not only that, but the story is a complete bore. The ending is so ridiculous it might as well be a children's tv show - and sadly it was the only part of the movie that's not trying to make you laugh.","

If I wasn't completely burnt out with the MCU at this point I might have the energy to be upset by this abomination of a movie.Taika Waititi is the director version of Ryan Reynolds! Sometimes he is amazing when he is restrained and thoughtful but most of the times he does the same thing over and over doing his thing no matter what the movie calls for.But at least they gave Natalie Portperson some nice cgi arms, tbh, she almost looked like a real human.","

"Benedict02","12 July 2022","Without even touching on plot holes and things that generally make no sense in this movie for the wider MCU, there is about thirty minutes of footage that belongs to what could have been a serious dark movie - to nobody's surprise all of these scenes include Christian Bale.This could have been a film about a man who loses his daughter and subsequently his faith in his God who becomes corrupted by a sword which was created by Knull, God of the Symbiotes (not that the movie feels the need to tell you any of this). As a result this man makes it his mission to rid the universe of all its Gods. And while on his journey this man turned God Butcher comes across a terminally ill woman who fell in love with one of the deities that our antagonist has made it his mission to kill.Now that's what we could have had... but what we got, is a movie so forgettable in it's plot that i barely remembered the Guardians of the Galaxy were in this when the credits roll, but the comedy in this movie is actively damaging in its attempt to be a carbon copy of Ragnarok. I liked Ragnarok, but I wasn't left wanting another one. This movie could have been so much more than a boring comedy over saturated with lame gags and over-used unfunny jokes; it absolutely wastes Oscar winning actors and actresses in its pursuit to be funny, that's it's just sad to watch because it sacrifices its story and all I end up thinking about is what it could have been.Despite the fact that Gorr the God Butcher is only seen KILLING ONE GOD!!! Christian Bale's performance is by far the highlight of the movie and it's a shame that he didn't have more screen time and his motives and transformation weren't more fully fleshed out. And I can't help but feel that had this movie been come a phase or two before now, and had someone other than Waititi working on the script, it would have been a much better movie. Instead it's just another factory produced piece of garbage churned out by the Marvel machine, but due to the inclusion of Bale and everything involving him it makes this movie disappointing more than anything.","

"VinsendVega","10 July 2022","Although I realy enjoyed Taika Waititi idiosyncratic style in Jojo Rabbit, It doesn't work for a movie like Thor. Previous Thor movies where never too serious and already had plenty of humor. Making a parody of a character like this just feels fake and turned the whole movie into a somewhat childish joke. The relationship between Thor and jane is very different from previous movies and I should probably tell you the director has taken a lot of artistic liberties with their back story. Thor is turned into a goofy Homer Simpson-type of loveable Idiot and the entire first half of the movie feels very empty. Some parts do get a good laugh but for me the whole movie was far too silly and childish.Positives: Christian bale makes great villain and the visuals are great (even by marvel standards).Not for serious fans. Woman and children seem to be the target audience here.","

"TheVictoriousV","7 July 2022","A lot of people expected the fourth and supposedly final Thor movie to be a passing of the hammer, and I don't blame them for detecting a pattern within the latest Marvel Universe titles -- at least the ones that concern the original Avengers:So far, Steve Rogers has handed his shield over to Sam ""The Falcon"" Wilson, we've seen a new Black Widow in the form of Yelena, and I'm pretty sure we got a new, younger Hawkeye in the Hawkeye TV show (I'm not gonna watch that), which is to say nothing of She-Hulk. And yes, the trailers for Taika Waititi's Thor: Love and Thunder made it seem as if Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth), who now seems kind of a joke, was going to surrender Mjölnir to Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), his bland love interest from the first two movies. Why her? Because it was in the comics, shush.Hell, pretty much all of these changes mirror the comic books. Passing a superhero mantle from one character to the next -- sometimes of a different race or gender -- is one of the medium's oldest traditions, so I could certainly see why people expected us to get a ""new"" Thor with this film (because apparently, first names are now mantles to be passed forth once a magical hammer abruptly repairs itself).However, after the latest Doctor Strange movie ventured into the Multiverse and changed very little in the process (despite adding such supposed game-changers as America Chavez and other stuff that likely won't be mentioned outside of the Doctor Strange or Scarlet Witch properties), I was genuinely thinking that the trailers were showing us an alternate reality; one that will only feature in this flick as a throwaway adventure and then never be acknowledged again. I won't reveal whether Mighty Thor is a permanent mainstay, but will report that I'm nevertheless troubled by the general directionlessness of Phase Four. What's this all for? What's the next Endgame? And why is the plot point ""Jane was snapped by Thanos and, due to a side effect of it, she now has cancer"" not an Onion headline?As the film begins, Thor is out adventuring with the Guardians of the Galaxy but is forced to reunite with Foster, Korg (Waititi's character from Ragnarok), and other older friends when Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale, who gets the best scenes of the film) starts exacting revenge on all ""gods"". That is, of course, the aliens that inspired the gods and goddesses of Earth mythologies (now including the likes of Zeus, as portrayed by Russell Crowe, who has the power to flick away Original Thor's robes and give us a good look at that regained ""god bod"" of his). He's not going around slaughtering deities willy-nilly.But in terms of more truly god-like (omnipotent) figures, the film also follows in the footsteps of Eternals by bringing in some more of Marvel Comics' more ""cosmic"" characters, specifically Eternity, who is a personification of the entire Universe and the source of Gorr's power -- so there's a decent explanation for why he would become something so impressive as a ""god"" butcher. Whether Eternity is still at the mercy of the Time Variance Authority or an angry witch who can ""destroy the Multiverse"" is anyone's guess. Could Konshu and Moon Knight rearrange the stars that comprise him at their own leisure? Who knows? It's useless to think too hard about Phase Four media.We also reunite with Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), who is the ""king"" of New Asgard while Thor is off with the Guardians. Much fuss has been made about the fact that the film calls a female ruler a king, to which more smart-alecky viewers will explain that Asgard is a made-up fantasy world and so it's not our place to question how the word ""king"" is used in their pretend space-Viking culture. Funny that ""king"" is apparently the only Anglic linguistic unit that's used differently whereas the rest of their language mirrors ours pretty straightforwardly, but whatever. Go off, kween. I mean, qing!Another notable ""character"", I guess, is Mjölnir itself -- which, like I said, makes a very sudden return and seems more interested in Jane than Thor. Its relationship with Thor supplies many supposed laughs. Is it an old ex? Old roommate? Estranged kid? Pet? Simple: It's whatever joke Waititi felt for at the time.Thor: Love and Thunder is very much another Marvel movie. Like many of the post-Phase Three additions, however, it does mostly allow the director to keep his voice. Waititi isn't as unrestrained as Rami was with Multiverse of Madness -- which strayed a little too far from the MCU mold for some fanboys -- but he's possibly even wackier here than with Ragnarok, and we're treated to some wild, interesting-looking worlds (particularly the nightmarish pocket realm of Gorr).The film has enough zaniness to go around and I do like Bale's ""Come to Daddy""-inspired performance, but the VFX will often look incomplete, the dreaded Marvel comedy is worse than ever (capping many nice scenes with a cheeky wisecrack or silly character moment and so deflating them -- when it doesn't outright take older dramatic moments and treat them with all the dignity of a Seltzerberg parody), and some scenes are shot like some McDonald's tie-in commercial that managed to get the actors from the real movie involved. Much like fast food, however, you're not wrong for liking it; I'm not here to stop you. Having just seen the Tollywood epic RRR (which was both crazier and yet treated its characters with more dignity than this), my own patience with Hollywood is the lowest it's ever been, though I guess there's little to be done (even as the spread of RRR does re-ignite my faith).I just hope that you're watching this because you feel it genuinely enriches your incomprehensibly short time on this cosmic spec we so briefly inhabit -- the fact of which bolsters just how astronomically lucky you are to be alive to experience this age of art -- and not because you're too lazy and complacent to seek out whatever isn't Hollywood-approved product. And yes, that includes if you're watching it just for Buff Mommy Portman; I'm all for that.","

It's not so much bad as it is just mindless. There's no intention, no direction, the movie feels as lost as it's title character who still has a lot of growth to do after his bro phase in Endgame. The film's plot is so bizarre and shallow that it's immensely talented cast is wasted. The jokes are so inconsistent that I can't believe Taika Watiti, a future comedic legend actually wrote this movie. In my opinion, Christian Bale was spectacularly let down. I was very excited for his character, because I really enjoy his work and in my opinion, he is one of the most talented actors working today. What we got was unbefitting for someone of his range and caliber. Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is as bad as Captain Marvel for me, but for the exact opposite reasons. The movie has way, WAY too much personality and ambitions, and it falls short of being memorable or coming remotely close to its ambitions. Instead, the movie comes off as more shallow then a baby pool and fails to justify its existence. Anyway, that's my attempt at a spoiler free review, I hope other MCU fans enjoy this one more than me (although that's looking doubtful).","

1. It's a movie by committee, which means it exists for the sole purpose of making money. They have to check certain boxes, make sure everyone is happy, and not offend anyone.2. It takes itself pretty seriously until they decide to throw in a joke, which is about every 90 seconds
3. Christian Bale is a great actor (from Empire of the Sun to American Psycho), so let's give him almost nothing to work with, aside from (yet another) ""I want to destroy everything"" bad guy
4. Everyone loves Guns n Roses, so we should play four of their songs! But not any of the deep cuts, just the hits at cliched parts of the movie (and even name a character Axl)

All the corniness made it really hard for me to get invested in the characters. I just didn't care what happened to anyone in the film, I looked at my watch at least three times and was happy when it was over. Also, stop shoving the WOKE nonsense down our throats.

An idiot in a movie with Spy Kids quality CGI, on a Marvel budget.I was looking forward to this so much, only to be disappointed at every turn. The script managed to somehow forget to have any character growth. At the end, Thor hasn't changed. He's had an adventure. His ex girlfriend has died. And a few random unimportant gods have died as well.There's just nothing redeeming about this movie.

The film is one long series of extravagant images, childish jokes, and goofy sight-gags, to the point of almost being a witless parody of the worst excesses of the genre. The CGI is technically impressive but artistically unimaginative (an exception being the B/W sequence), the story is dull and derivative, the A-list cast is stuck delivering a D-list script that would have been at home in a 1970's Saturday morning cartoon, the climatic fight is cretinous (but not unexpected from a production company that once gave the world the Mickey Mouse Club) and the maudlin ending risible. I forced myself to finish the film (mostly watching with one eye and 1/10 of my brain (which was still more than needed)). The film is not just awful, its annoyingly and irritatingly awful but, sadly, it still made money, so I'll save a 1/10 score for the inevitable next installment.","

"roaches_97","8 July 2022","Yeah I said it, this film is worse than Dark World. It's painfully unfunny, the visuals are over saturated, and the plot is dumb. If Gorr's plan is to kill all the gods by wishing them out of existence, then why did he make himself known to them instead of staying under the radar and sneaking in to the magical bs wishing well? Why didn't Thor use his lightning powers that he had in Ragnarok to fight Gorr instead of risking losing his axe? There are tons of inconsistencies like this throughout the film. The performances are generally okay. Hemsworth does well as Thor, Natalie Portman is alright as Jane Foster, Tessa Thompson gives a terrible performance, and Christian Bale is the highlight of the movie. The movie just feels empty overall. It means nothing, there is no emotional payoff to any of it. And the sad thing is, this is one of the better post-Endgame Marvel movies.","

"malice_o_conner","8 July 2022","This is yet another installment of the drivel from Hollywood/Marvel. While it had more Thor than Strange was part of his 2nd movie - this was not coherent, in fact rather it was whimsical, directionless, and complete waste. I can only give credit to Bale's performance as he seemed to be the only one who was trying. Everyone else was a hollow representation, a shell of the character. Too bad Bale was coming from another film to put the 100% to this - although it wouldn't have saved this trash.Every attempt to be funny was a miss to me. Everything that was meant to have meaning was meaningless. Everything that was supposed to have a reason, either didn't or was explained in the dumbest way possible. This is just another installment of Propaganda Marvel films, and the complete ideocracy that has become Hollywood today. They do not care, everything is a tool to spread the messages that want. Nothing is sacred, nothing is nuanced, or complex. When it should be complex, it's pathetically simple. Like if you wanted to break into CIA HQ in Langly, it's not a problem because what you need will fall in your lap, and all the guards are completely inept. Oh and like an Epstein - the cameras will magically ""not work"". They think you are this dumb that you should be eating this puke pile up and be saying, ""thank you, may I have another?""
The film has so much to go over but not without spoilers so I simply say miss this one. Miss it entirely. Don't bother with it even in streaming, as it was a complete and utter waste of time. I'd rather have watched grass grow, at least I could contemplate the meaning of life and have got more out of it.","

This is beyond a doubt one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen. You will instantly regret paying good money to see it. Remember when Matt Damon made the movie funny because he over acted well now he is the least corny person in this film and all other actors are grand over caricatures of their characters. This is horrible, I have my wife's sweater and the only reason I can't stay soundly asleep is because the horrible noise which accompanies the horrible cgi, wakes me up all over again. Christian Bale forgot how to act, Natalie Portman, seriously and Chris - you were horrible. Save your money.","

"abirchy-96827","7 July 2022","The story of this movie may not be the best we have seen in the MCU till now but the movie will definitely entertain you.. For like first 40-50 minutes I thought this was a joke. But later it got better. Especially fight scenes with Gorr-The God Butcher were top notch. Visuals were also pretty good. Although I wanted some kind of different ending but it's not bad either. Some scenes will definitely make you cry for sure. For MCU fans this will a good piece for entertainment otherwise if you are not a marvel fan you may not like this movie much.Spoiler warning:Giving you a little bit of spoiler : I guess Thor will be the first avenger to get 5th film of his own. Really waiting for that. Hopefully that will become before the next Avengers film because this film really doesn't set the future of Thor to join in the Avengers team again.","

"dextermorgan-91603","7 July 2022","My title of review is a line said by Russel Crowe's character Zeus and it aptly summarises the problem of this movie.How the mighty have fallen.... said by Thor to Zeus also nicely fits the movie.Incessant gags and idiotic quips marred the already tiring nonsensical screenplay. Christian Bale had barely any screentime and is wasted completely i guess even a thespian such as him has accepted defeat at the hands of mcu. And how come everyone is suddenly a worthy candidate? In the first film Odin had said he whosoever is Worthy shall possess the power of thor, but here apparently everyone is out of the blue. You don't need proper training, skills or experience because... reasons i guess.Only Russel Crowe's Zeus seemed serious and menacing enough but he isn't given a lot to play with. Chris doesn't bother anymore with the pile of cash at his feet i guess butchering Norse mythology left and right. Well u get what you paid for i guess.","

Gorr is underutilized despite Bales performance and the comedy is extremely cheesy at times. The screaming goats....wow did that get old fast. Love and Thunder never takes itself seriously. Every scene is a setup for a punchline. A dramatic moment will play out and 5 seconds later que a joke. Because of this I couldn't take anything seriously and I found myself bored. Despite a visually striking fight scene in the shadow realm none of the action stood out. A disappointment.","

"jtrascap","2 November 2022","As this series goes on, it leaves the idea of nobility behind and makes the cast a bunch of rambling fools in search of a quest. The first Thor film may have been over-serious, but it pulled at the character in different ways and gave it depth; Thor had a genuine soul. This one reduces the character to a running joke about incompetence in anything but fighting - it's as if Marvel (Disney) made the series for a younger and younger audience each go round. All the characters are slight and one-note, the is plot thin and moves fast but randomly, like a drunk on a country road. It's such a shame - the original was about family, trust and honor - there's absolutely nothing honorable here. It just feels like a quick cash grab.","

"beornmatt","11 July 2022","Love and Thunder tries way too hard to capture the same humorous vibe as Ragnarok (one of my top MCU films, btw) while telling a very dark story about Gorr the God-Butcher and it misses continually. Hemsworth is great as Thor and did the best he could with what he was given. Christian Bale was head and shoulders above the rest as Gorr, and I wish we'd seen him as a real threat in a serious movie. He could have been a good sympathetic villain like Thanos and I wish I could have seen him in that capacity.Unfortunately, however, everything else falls flat. Waititi's insistence on putting a joke in every scene undercuts the times that he wants to convey emotion and just cheapens everything. The other cast are clearly just there for the payday, especially Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie. I've never been sold on her as the actress for the character and her wooden performance here just reinforces that.All told, I wouldn't even watch this again on Disney+. I'm mad I spent money on it.","

"rnavarro-81504","10 July 2023","This was an embarrassment to the MCU, to the late Stan Lee, to Disney.Heavy on cheesy quips, jokes, and one liners. The writers tried far too hard to recreate the fun of Ragnarok, of Guardians, etc. Previous MCU movies had serious action, great visual effects, an interesting storyline, and the occasional humorous moment. Love & Thunder seemed to shoot for being a parody of the MCU lineup. Pointless action scenes that did little for the franchise, a boring storyline, with stabs at humor early and far too often. Many of our favorite characters whittled down to nothing.The soundtrack had potential. Lots (and I mean LOTS!) of Guns & Roses, with even a character named Axl. But like the humor, too much means too much. By comparison look back at Avengers: Endgame. Appropriate music selections throughout, to include that final scene of Cap slow dancing with Peggy Carter to jazz. Something for everyone.The end of the credits tells us ""Thor will return."" He's one of my favorites, but if the next effort is the same as Love & Thunder, just let the franchise enter Valhalla and spare the fans the agony.","

"AncienOne23","11 July 2022","I'm an MCU fan and have enjoyed prior Thor movies, but rate Love and Thunder as disappointing and the least entertaining of the series. I had high hopes with the Gorr the God Butcher storyline, which was excellent in the comics but rushed in the movie. Christian Bale was excellent and should have been given more time. Instead there were distracting aspects of the movie.such as the silly treatment of Zeus and the other gods of the universe. The same goes with many of the jokes. They were funny but it slid into camp with the acting sometimes sloppy. The Jane Forster storyline was OK but not engaging at times with the mixed storylines. Asgard as an amusement park was briefly funny, but that and the heavy inclusion of children came off as campy as well at times. The inclusion of Eternity was also a weak plot device that missed the opportunity to build interest in the universal figures of the MCU. I'm hoping the sloppy writing is not a sign of things to come with the MCU.","

"Chandelier-49579","7 July 2022","I just finished watching this movie and it entirely met my expectations.To start with what i liked; the first bit with Thor and the guardians and christian bale as the villian.But for the rest of the movie i found the plot to be weak and Thor acting like a idiot most of the time. Why is the drunk mercenary slaver still leading Asgard and called a KING?? Why do the ppl of asgard even put up with this horrible person and havent started an uprising yet.Another strange name thing was with Jane, why does she call herself Thor while wielding mjolnir? Not only does she steal his weapon and garb but also his name. This is never explained in the movie. Oh Nathalie Portperson is beautiful to look at but looked ridiculous in that armor and beefed up chest. The dresses with the metal parts in them from the previous movies fitted her way better.The female gaze scene with thor being shackled, naked, in front of a big crowd would normally be a fine scene. But in this polarized day and age it just shows the double standards of those complaining about female nudity. If it would have been Jane Foster that ended up shackled, naked and humiliated the world would have been 2 small.The movie is way to comical and doesn't treat ANYTHING serious. In Ragnarok it was already going overboard a little but here the gloves came of. Thor losing his brother, father, friends? Lol! Thor losing his home and most of his people, lol! Children are kidnapped? Dont worry about it. Zeus, the leader of the greec pantion getting 1 shot, lol!I think i just end it here, hopefully me review convinced you to not waste your time and money on it.","

Unfortuanally, like that One, it feels messy.

"thesar-2","9 July 2022","Of ALL the Trek movies, this had to pay homage to...Star Trek V?! Now, yeah, V has kinda grown on me over the years and it's definitely no longer the worst one. But still, Thor: Love and Thunder is helluva lot better.In a rare occurrence, the Thor quadrilogy joins both the Spider-Man Home Movies and the Mission: Impossible franchise as the few series that gets progressively better with each chapter. About half-way through this, I thought I liked Ragnarok more. That all changed in the highly enjoyable final act.Thor is BACK, baby. Well, from his Dad-Bod ways and as he's helping out the happy underdogs across the universe, he discovers both Love and Thunderous rage from a God-Butcher. Pray Thor makes it out of this one.The funny thing about this movie that reunites Chris Hemsworth with Natalie Portman: I wasn't 100% looking forward to that reunion prior to starting this adventure-comedy. Truthfully, she is NOT one of my favorite actresses and I'll get right to the point: She practically steals Thor's Thunder throughout this film. She was spectacular and my favorite part of this movie. And this may be my favorite role for her.Now, that said, I thoroughly enjoyed Chris Hemsworth - he was having a ball and it shows he really enjoys entertaining the masses as the title character. The rest of the cast was equally awesome, except, well, The Bland-Batman.I mean, Christian Bale as the Baddie. He was fine, but really uneven. He almost acted like the Joker/Riddler at some moments and then menacingly quiet and composed the next. And back and forth he went. Unfortunately, he was never likable enough to gain ANY sympathy from me - even though his character had well-defined motivation and depth.While this had a KILLER soundtrack, was absolutely hilarious and is technically better than Ragnarok, it's not by much and it's a perfect companion to that third one. Needless to say, if you loved Ragnarok, this will have the same impact for you. And you might as well forget those first two Thors. Just stick with the two best: Ragnarok & Love & Thunder.***Final Thoughts: I HATE that Marvel makes us stay through the credits. Literally, it's my least favorite part of the MCU. BUT, every once in a while, an MCU chapter will change my mind, albeit temporarily. You simply MUST stay through to the very last few seconds. I liked the first one pretty well and LOVED the last one.","

This movie is just trash in my opinion, they took a great strong character, smart and courageous to turn him in to the end of all jokes. As the new norm from Disney movies, make the female the center of attention, checked! Make man look dumb, checked! Have gay characters, checked! Take all the great aspects of main character and turn them in to crap, checked!So yes, Valkyrie is a lesbian, Korg is gay, why? Who ask for this? Why movies have to shoehorn this into every single movie now adays when there is no purpose to the story?And don't get me started about the screaming goats screaming every 10 to 15 minutes of the movie like watching the screaming goat of Tikok video put on repeat for 2 hours. If that's your thing of being torture hearing a goat screaming, go ahead and watch this movie, but for me after the second screaming I was over it.And lest talk about the gods!!! Zeus! Was Crow supposed to do a Greek accent?The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars was because Bales acting that made it watchable, but if he wasn't in it, I would have care less for this movie.So, in short skip this movie till it comes out on Disney + or better yet watch i on someone's else dime at their home.","

I was watching that whole scene play out and I just was in absolute disbelief... That is by far one of the dumbest scenes I have EVER seen in a movie....SO THOR CAN SHARE HIS POWER WITH 50 KIDS?That power could have come in handy on Adguard when hella was attacking... Hmm idk...

Why not take 5 seconds and imbue everyone on the ship and have 100 Thor's fighting Thanos...Why didn't they do that? Because it's dumb... And its just a McGuffin to end the movie.Then the whole ETERNITY thing....
That single handedly just ruined the MCU...

This movie was different. Such a catastrophe for the marvel franchise. There's no plot, writing, directing or special effects ! They cast some of the greatest actors of this and the last decade but they gave them awful scripts and roles , making them terrible. No need to specify about the plot , I do not think that there is one actually. Writing isnt even a thing here ,they probably just improvising some silly sentences. Special effects? More like a copy of an old version of unreal engine . Not even cinematic CGI , with the actors in all fighting scenes to be graphics . I'm really disappointed, not only with the current situation but with myself too . I just spended 2 hours and 10 bucks of my time and money to watch one of the worst movies of the decade . Actors of a high level and huge budget were wasted .If you haven't seen this movie , DO NOT . This was the greatest mistake of mine because I didn't read any of the comments before watching by myself.Also I feel sorry about all this people in the cinema, who where tricked by this money - earning movie system. Goodbye Marvel (and Disney)",NA

"hasalreadybeentaken","13 July 2022","This movie is ridiculous. Cringe scenes, bad (really bad) dialog.. The only thing I actually appreciated was Bale's character... Everything else was a shocker for me. Disney came along, and Marvel stopped being serious. The first Thor movie deserves the oscar for best picture if compared to this..",NA
