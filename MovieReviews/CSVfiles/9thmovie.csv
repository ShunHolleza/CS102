"The Amazing Spider-Man","classicsoncall","9 July 2012","There was no way I was going to miss this film, but after reading a number of reviews by fans here I began to have some reservations. Most of that had to do with the retelling of the origin, and fundamentally I agree that this probably wasn't necessary after only ten years since the Tobey McGuire version. But now that I've seen it, I can say my second thoughts were unwarranted because this film provides an adrenaline rush with every spider web fired.I always had this unsettled feeling with the McGuire Spider-Man, or more accurately, with the McGuire Peter Parker. I found him to be too much of a wuss, wimping out whenever confronted as the timid teenager. With Andrew Garfield, I didn't get the impression he was OK to let things go whenever a bully came on the scene. With only one picture under his belt as opposed to Tobey's three, I'm going with the new kid in town.Whether intended or not, I also preferred the darker tone to this take on the Spidey character. Many of the action scenes occurred at night and better conveyed a sense that this costumed hero might be more of a menace than a friend. Peter Parker's dinner clash with Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) helped push that agenda and it worked pretty well.As for the main villain, a mixed reaction. There were times The Lizard (Rhys Ifans) looked a bit corny and other times truly menacing. It seemed to me that the film had trouble establishing the villain's proportion in relation to Spider-Man and other humans. In some scenes he looked like a monster, at others merely somewhat larger than Spider-Man. However the concept of cross-species genetics on which The Lizard came to being was handled rather well and proved effective.As always, my favorite moment in a Marvel hero movie did not leave me disappointed. Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance once again, this time as the oblivious librarian listening to a symphony while Spidey and The Lizard make a shambles of the bookcases in the background. I can't believe he'll be ninety at the end of this year.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","AmbushBug26","15 July 2012","Being a Spider-man comic book fan I can say that a lot of the stuff that happens in this story is true to the comic book Spider-man. Spider-man has web shooters, Spider-man likes to joke a lot, Gwen Stacy was Spider-man's first love, etc. So Anyone who is a fan of the comics will respect this movie on that merit, the merit that it was faithful to the source material while bringing in new stuff without losing what made Spider-man who he is.People who've only seen the Spider-man films and never bothered to read any of the comics. Won't like this film as much. They'll say the same old stuff. ""Why was this made? We've seen this already?"" Blah blah blah.Let me go off saying that behind Spider-man 2, this is probably the best of the Spider-man trilogy for one reason.....it avoids all clichés that the original trilogy didn't. In fact the film pretty much avoids all clichés at all. I'll try and explain a few without spoiling the film.Well first of all the woman in this film aren't morons. One of the main problems I had with Sam Raimi's films was the fact that all woman were pretty much portrayed as objects that Spider-man can save. None of them do anything helpful. Sure Mary Jane tried to hit Doctor Octopus with a plank in the second film, but she couldn't even do that right. That's not the case here. Gwen actually has a confrontation with with villain and she doesn't screw around, I won't say what she does but when I saw it happen I couldn't help but cheer. Finally a Spider-man film where the woman have a brain-stem.The second cliché it avoids is being predictable. The original films basically have Spider-man going through the motions. Girl gets kidnapped, Spidey saves girl, Spidey defeats villain or jumps out of the way so the villain can do harm to himself. That is not the case with this film, a lot of the time you think one thing is going to happen but then it doesn't and the opposite happens.The third cliché it avoids is having silly moments. The first trilogy had a lot of them, yes even Spider-man 2 (The raindrops keep falling on my head scene). Going back an having re-watched the Sam Raimi trilogy before seeing this one, the films are more like popcorn films. Sam Raimi is the master at making B movies and that's what the original trilogy was, an epic scale B Movie. With this film, they get a little more serious. There's not really any goofy moments that I can think of and if there are then it's usually played for laughs.Also THANK GOD They got Flash Thompson right. Sam Raimi used Flash so he could be the stereotypical bully, and at the beginning you think that's what Marc Webb plans to do, but then he shows that Flash isn't as big a douche as he makes himself out to be. Flash is one of my favourite Spider-man characters in the comics, and I'd like to say ""thank you Marc Webb for avoiding the cliché of him just being a bully and actually making him a human being with depth."" The film also does other things right besides avoiding clichés. The actors all do fantastic jobs and I will go on record saying that Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-man and a great role model for young boys even though he has his flaws. Martin Sheen was great as an Uncle Ben who is kind, understanding, but at the same time doesn't take any crap. Emma Stone was great as the kind of jokey but intelligent Gwen Stacy who is a strong positive role model for young woman. The Guy who played the villain was great, The girl who played Aunt May was good in the few scenes she was in. Not a weak link in the bunch.So I've done nothing but praise this film so far, so why is it still behind Spider-man 2 in my books? Well the film does have flaw, mainly two. One it's rushed, the only one who really pays for it being rushed is the villain who only gets one line of dialogue to explain his motives and even then we're not sure why he's doing that. The second flaw is that it doesn't have this big epic feel that Spider-man 2 had, it doesn't feel like it was made to be a big summer blockbuster, instead it was made to be an Indy film with a big budget....although maybe that's why I liked it so much, it focuses more on characters than action.....hurm.....I'm still on the fence with that last one.The Amazing Spider-man is a good film. It avoids most if not all clichés, it's fresh, it's interesting, it's got characters you love to see and actually feel for played by fantastic actors, it's a great Spider-man film and it's sad that a lot of fans seem to be hating it right now. I honestly can't see what's to hate.Good film, go see it.....oh by the way.....I wouldn't recommend seeing it in 3D, there are a few moments where you're like ""Whoa cool"" but not much.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","TheNorwegianGuy","10 November 2012","I admit that I too didn't exactly get that excited when I heard that this was in the making. The Sam Raimi trilogy was a fun ride, and the idea of making another Spider-Man movie with a completely new cast seemed strange and unnecessary. When the cast was announced, I got a little bit curious, but nothing more.However, when I watched it, I got a whole other impression. I really liked it. The atmosphere was great, and perhaps a little darker than the Sam Raimi movies at times. I know many of you who read this will hate me for saying this, but I actually think this movie was a LITTLE bit better that the previous ones. Not much, but just a hint better. One thing is the cast. I really didn't like Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man that much. I didn't have a huge problem with him back then, but now when I saw this, I must say that I like Andrew Garfields ""version"" better. He's a little more tougher, both physically and in personality. Also, I think Emma Stone did good as Gwen Stacy. I liked her better as Peter Parker's girlfriend than Kirsten Dunst. The Villain, too, was great. I won't say more about him, not wanting to spoil anything.When I read many of the reviews in here, I don't see much positivity about this movie. I think that's unfair. At least, it's mediocre. Giving this a 1/10 is criminally wrong. At least I think so. If you wonder if you should see this or not, at least give it a chance. Don't let the bad reviews scare you away.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Hellmant","6 July 2012","'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN': Five Stars (Out of Five)The 'BATMAN BEGINS' of Spider-Man films, this reboot to Sam Raimi's blockbuster trilogy doesn't disappoint and I'd go as far as to say it's amazing! Director Marc Webb (who made his debut with 2009's critically acclaimed hit '(500) DAYS OF SUMMER') takes over the franchise with Andrew Garfield (of 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' fame) replacing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man. The film was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who also co-wrote 'SPIDER-MAN 2' and '3') and Steve Kloves (who wrote every 'HARRY POTTER' film). This film focuses entirely on Peter's high school years while he learns to first develop his powers as well as cope with the disappearance of his parents and who his father really was (unlike the original Sam Raimi film). It's also a little more faithful to the comic, in some ways, by having Parker develop artificial web-shooters that he uses to swing around on, rather than being able to produce them physically as part of his super powers. It also goes back to having Gwen Stacy (his original love interest from the comics) as the object of his affection rather than Mary Jane (like the Raimi films). Gwen is played beautifully by 'it girl' Emma Stone (the object of Jim Carrey's obsession). The movie, despite treading on some old ground, is thoroughly entertaining and powerfully well made. This story begins with Peter as a young boy (Max Charles) being left in the care of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) by his parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz), who disappear without ever being heard from again. Peter grows up to be a somewhat awkward teen (Garfield, who's way too old to play a teen) but is much cooler than Parker probably should be; he rides a skateboard and actually flirts (successfully) with his high school crush Gwen Stacy (Stone). One day he finds his father's old briefcase which leads him to seek out his father's old associate, a scientist by the name of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). Gwen actually works at Oscorp with Connors, which is where Parker stumbles into a lab experimenting on genetically modified spiders and is bit by one. He of course develops spider like powers and when his Uncle is killed makes it his mission to fight crime and get revenge. In this film he must deal with Dr. Connors' alter ego, the genetically mutated monster 'The Lizard' (which is the first time the classic Spider-Man villain has graced the silver screen), as well as the police, lead by Gwen's father Captain Stacy (Denis Leary).The movie does go over a lot of the same plot points as the original Sam Raimi hit but it delves a little more deeper in to them. I thought the first two 'SPIDER-MAN' films had a great amount of emotional drama and character development (which is why they're two of my favorite films) but this installment manages to outdo them. It really gets in to the character of Peter Parker, on a relatable level to almost every high school nerd (present or past) and Garfield plays him amazingly. I thought Maguire was about as good a Spider-Man as they could have casted but somehow Garfield manages to outdo him, mostly with passion for the role (he says he cried the first time he put on the costume). Stone is a little cuter and more adorable than Kirsten Dunst, I wouldn't say she's a better actress but it's definitely easier to fall for her character than Mary Jane's (due to Stone's likability). Sheen and Field are classic like always and Ifans makes a memorable insane villain. The acting is definitely a little better in this film but the script is also smarter and more complex and Webb's direction is impressively fitting. I wouldn't say he's as good a director as Sam Raimi but it's nice to see a different take on the series. Besides all the material that's already been done there's definitely enough new stuff to make the film interesting and thrilling. I'd say it's a better reboot film than 'BATMAN BEGINS' even, it's no 'THE DARK KNIGHT' but it is better than Nolan's original Batman film. If you're a fan of the series or the character (and Spider-Man is my favorite superhero) you're sure to be thrilled.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhcS7Q-CkYE","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Robert_duder","3 May 2014","Going back a few years when Sam Raimi's Spiderman released it was jaw dropping. It was sort of the spring board for the current excess of superhero films we see now. Most of us were definitively disappointed in Spiderman 3 but disappointed enough that we thought it should end the franchise and encourage a reboot only TWO years later? Fortunately for them the reboot isn't so bad and actually very entertaining and spidey fans won't be disappointed. I don't think its nearly as good as the original Raimi's Spiderman but then at that time it was new and fresh and captivating to see a live action, non-campy superhero on screen. The Amazing Spiderman does manage to make itself different enough to make you not feel like you're watching something you've seen a dozen times over. Its a different spin on the Spiderman story while still keeping key elements firmly in place (maybe Marc Webb should give Zack Snyder a few tips.) They also establish enough back story to make this a lucrative franchise for at least three films if they don't screw it up some way and get it scrapped like they did the first time around. At the same time of being different enough it isn't really that far fetched from Raimi's trilogy. It still has the same feel and intensity and solid special effects. As someone who despises CGI I didn't find it silly or overused (though its clearly used a lot) its done very well including The Lizard who is complete CGI.If they absolutely had to do this then Andrew Garfield was a great choice for the role of Peter Parker and Spiderman to a lesser extent. Its funny because I always thought Tobey Maguire made a great Spiderman but lacked as Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield makes a great, awkward, angsty teen Peter Parker but lacks something significant as Spiderman. I don't know what it is...but its something. Still he is at least good in both roles. Emma Stone is terrific as Gwen Stacy. Her chemistry with Garfield is perfect (though again not quite as good as Dunst and Maguire) and she shows once again why she's one of the best young talents in Hollywood. Stone outdoes herself in her role. Rhys Ifans is also perfectly suited as our villain Kurt Connors/The Lizard. Playing a villain (especially a giant Lizard) is extremely difficult to not make campy but Ifans plays it very seriously and is a very viable enemy. He absolutely brings the comic villain genius to life. Denis Leary is a great addition to as Gwen's father and Police Captain who is also somewhat of a nemesis for Spiderman and Peter Parker. His character adds a certain layer of depth to the story and he plays it very seriously even when he's being sarcastic and angry. It wouldn't even be fathomable for me to mention Martin Sheen and Sally Field, two absolute legends of Hollywood playing Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Sadly they are very underused and only have a few good scenes in the beginning of the film but I wanted to see more of them because of who they are as actors.Part of the issue I had with The Amazing Spiderman was perhaps the lack of emotional depth, the human side that we miss out on. The connection between Peter and his Uncle and Aunt isn't quite felt as well as it should have been. I wasn't moved enough when Uncle Ben was killed. However, this film gets definitively and absolutely better as it goes on. The end of the film is superior to the first part in every way. Its intense, emotional, action packed and jaw dropping. If the entire film was at the quality of the latter half it might have been a ten. The High School Spiderman/Lizard fight is legendary (especially with one of Stan Lee's best cameos), the scenes between Garfield and Leary and the final battle all make this an absolute must see. Marc Webb did an excellent job of creating something that could have and almost should have been a disaster into a viable and watchable franchise. I wanted to complain about how incredibly cheesy and melodramatic the ""crane"" scene was during the last scene but darned if it didn't make me get goosebumps and feel all warm and squishy. One thing is for certain, there isn't a Spiderman fan out there that can't say this isn't well done and very entertaining. There is some terrific Spiderman imagery (again especially towards the end.) Let's hope Marc Webb can hold this together throughout the franchise's life. Its greatest feat was to overcome was being far too soon for it to be made and it does overcome that. 8.5/10","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Ben_Horror","17 July 2012","With the success of the first X-Men movie in 2000, Bryan Singer pretty much paved the way for all the comic book movies we see today. That included a certain super hero movie made by Sami Rami in 2002 where a nerdy guy (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a radioactive spider and inherits superhuman powers. If Singer had paved the way, then Rami provided the icing on the cake: a faithful, smart, well-acted super hero flick that had as much heart and sincerity packed in as it had all those set pieces. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned, though underrated, third episode.Which brings us to what we have here: while not a beat for beat remake, you get the same story more or less with a different love interest and villain. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) sneaks into a research facility and gets bitten by a radioactive/genetically enhanced spider. He gets super powers and becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a doctor (Rhys Ifans) working at the same facility, is being forced to close down his research into tissue regeneration. In desperation, he injects himself with an untested self-generating lizard vaccine and becomes a half man/half lizard thing. Spider-Man is then forced into action to stop him from spreading this contagion throughout the city of New York. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is the damsel in distress/love interest and plays a role in trying to stop the crazed beast.First things first: this is not a bad film. It's well acted by all the principals, has good effects, a scary and menacing villain, some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the Rami version. Parker is more evidently scientific and intelligent here. Also the police's notion that Spider-Man is a menace to the public is more clearly defined, especially in the scene where he disarms an officer. The new idea is that Parker can hear the movements of spiders and it's a good addition. So where does it all go wrong? The short answer: it's just that it's so pointless. We had already seen the story before. There was absolutely no reason to tell it again. This movie could easily have been Spider-Man 4 with Andrew Garfield filling in the Spidey spandex instead of Tobey Maguire. But Marvel – in their infinite wisdom – just chose to tell the same story a second time. Going by that rationale, presumably Andrew Garfield will be cast aside like a disused sock when they inevitably choose to 'reboot' the franchise again in ten years or so. It is a scarily unimaginative tactic and it is one they will continue to do until there is a massive financial failure.This movie follows the same set up as the 2002 version: Parker being picked on, getting advice from his sage-like uncle (Martin Sheen), being bitten, getting his powers/climbing walls, and turning his back on a situation which unfortunately has tragic consequences for a family member. It's all a case of been there, done that. If you want to compare it to the Rami original, then the short answer is; as good as Andrew Garfield is, Tobey Maguire was better. Maguire filled the suit better; on occasion, Garfield is prone to looking thin and scrawny during several scenes. Even the suit looked better in the Rami movies. And those earlier movies had a heart and sincerity – especially in the relationship between Peter and his aunt and uncle that you don't see here. Again we ask: why does this movie exist?And there are holes: there's a massive lizard running around, wreaking havoc; yet the police are more preoccupied with pointing their guns at Spider-Man – despite the fact that he saved a child in a (surprise, surprise) rehashed scene set on a bridge taken from Rami's first movie. In another part, the citizens of the city (once again - in a bit taken from Rami's movie) unite to help Spider-Man cross the city using tower cranes – despite the fact that there are buildings all around him. Heck, even the villain is initially a do-gooder like Norman Osborn and Dr. Octavius – again from the Rami movies.It also seems to pull inspiration from another super hero movie: Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) in that it's slightly darker, tells such a large origin story that just like Batman Begins, Spider-Man doesn't actually show up on screen for the first hour. So if you take two parts Batman Begins and add a touch of Rami's Spider-Man, the result is what you have here. Additionally, the introduction of the web shooters, while being faithful to the original comics and emphasizing Parker's intellect, is a bit of a mixed blessing. The notion of the web being an organic material rather than being fired from mechanical devices actually made more sense.It's not that reboots are a bad idea, they're not. In certain situations they can work well, provided for example, enough time has elapsed. But there is no point in retelling the same story if the initial release is still relatively recent. In addition, it helps if the story wasn't covered well the first time, or it was a bad movie to begin with. Going by this criteria, Marvel's latest cash cow is unnecessary on all three accounts.In closing, if you haven't already seen the Rami movie from 2002, go watch it instead. If you have seen it, then this probably won't live up to it and you will be left feeling a little underwhelmed. It's fair to say that for anyone over the age of eighteen, this movie will seem rather half-hearted and senseless; for those under eighteen, this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever. Yes, it's a movie that will divide opinions, primarily on the sole reason for its existence. Not a bad, or a badly made flick, by any means just a pointless one.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","thesar-2","4 July 2012","I don't have an argument that Spider-Man's origin story didn't need to be remade for I've seen plenty of very decent to mediocre reboots before. But, what makes this a worthless remake was that it backtracked on all that was good before it.Heart, soul, good soundtrack, excellent score, acting, chemistry, heroism, humor and quotable dialogue were present in the original Spider-Man movies – and yeah, even #3. This movie lacked ALL of those. Heck, it even deleted one of the main characters and often hilarious: J. Johan Jameson. Shame.I was even willing to over look the obvious first hour or so that inevitably retold the same old story of pansy Parker, a love interest, the bullies, the Aunt & Uncle, the spider bite, the transformation and the first try-outs. Without anyone (and I guess me now) spoiling that, we all knew that was coming. But, what I didn't foresee was how blah it all was going to be. How boring and trite.And pleasePLEASE do not let the advertisements fool you into filling a seat for a movie you've seen before: ""The Untold Story"" was about as revealing as finding out about Ellen Ripley's all-but irrelevant daughter in the director's cut of Aliens.What the movie is trying to tell us is that Spider-Man is a hero, that he loves Gwen Stacy and that, despite how great the Hulk looked in The Avengers, a giant lizard man can look real on screen using 1996's technology. No apologies: I didn't buy any one of these things the script displayed. In fact, it showed so much and yet, so much felt left out. So many story lines began and either faded or we're given half-ass explanations.Don't get me wrong; I didn't full-on hate on The Amazing Spider-Man. Of the approximately 20 minutes (of 136) of screen time Spidey was on the screen, he lookeddecent, albeit the shots still looked like deleted scenes from the previous series. And even though Tobey Maguire spun webs around Andrew Garfield's Parker, he still did a good job. I will even give it to both the script and Garfield: Spider-Man's signature sarcasm was funnier this time around.Is it redundant to give the synopsis since I already reviewed the 10-year-old original? Yes, except this time around instead of a green bad guy from Oscorp being human, this one had a green bad guy from Oscorp being a laughable CGI Godzilla offspring. Oh, and as much as I love Emma Stone, her character, Gwen Stacy, first introduced in Spider-Man 3, was so lifeless, you'd have to miss Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane.I simply cannot recommend this movie. Again, of the 136 minutes, 40 were good, but that did not outweigh the bad-3-D effects or 96 other slow-paced, unoriginal and uninspiring minutes.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","g-bodyl","28 January 2014","Only five years after the universally-hated Spider-Man 3(not me, though), Columbia Pictures have decided to give Peter Parker and his alter ego, Spider-man a fresh start. This film is essentially quite similar to 2002's film, but also features a few differences mainly a personality change in Peter. I don't know if I like this film any better than the original trilogy. This film is action-packed, has a great cast, and a rather fun villain in ""The Lizard,"" but this film doesn't live up to the trilogy that gave Spider-Man a name for himself.Marc Webb's film explores the origins of Spider-Man and also unlike the trilogy, we learn more about Peter's past including what happened to his family. As Peter is exploring his past, he is lead to his father's former partner who happens to be too smart for his own good. Also, Peter strikes a relationship with the daughter of the police captain, Gwen Stacy.The acting is really not too bad. An Andrew Garfield/Emma Stone pairing is not as good as the Maguire/Dunst pairing, but they still do very good and it's nice to see some cockiness in Peter's attitude instead of complete nerdiness. The Lizard, played wonderfully by Rhys Ifans, is a good villain to watch. The rest of the cast rounded out with Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field gives this film some starpower.Overall, this is definitely not a bad film and it's very entertaining. But we must ask ourselves, is this a necessary reboot? Honestly, I would rather have seen a Spider-Man 4, but who's to complain. This is a solid entry into the superhero genre despite really offering anything new. But hey I was entertained and that is all what matters. I rate this film 8/10.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","thinker1691","19 November 2012","This movie "" The Amazing Spiderman, "" has been way over-due. Ever since it's initial creation by Stan Lee (who makes his usual Cameo appearance), audiences have been hungrily awaiting this new addition. This time, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) confronts a new and incredibly powerful super villain called, 'The Lizard'. Self created by a one armed scientist, named ( Rhys Ifans ) or Dr. Curt Connors, Spiderman unknowingly gives the fantastic formula to a desperate man who has been trying to invent a way for a human to re-generate a missing limb, without realizing the unfortunate side effects. From the beginning, the film has a dark, foreboding and sinister aspect, which pervades through the entire story. Indeed, this sequel returns to it's early history in that the audience is introduced to Parker's lost parents, as well as his present guardians superbly played by Martin Sheen (Who adds a bit of Panache to the movie and Sally Field. Furthermore, Parker is given a new girlfriend called Gwen Stacy and her father seriously played by Denis Leary. The movie itself is incredible, what with all new high flying action sequences, aerial effects and numerous exciting scenes. Although a bit heavy in using mostly nighttime exteriors, it does lend credence to Parker's equally somber state of mind. Over all, the film is grimly superior to earlier chapters and is therefore easily crafted to enthrall us. As a result, the cast and crew, have intentionally created a Classic in the process. Easily recommended to all. ****","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","cultfilmfreaksdotcom","3 July 2012","In one scene, right after a spider in the Oscorp Laboratories bites Peter Parker: he falls asleep in a subway only to be awakened by a random loser who (for some strange reason) places a beer bottle on Parker's head. A drop of water from the bottle rolls down onto Peter's face, causing him to fling to the top of the car and stick to the ceiling – like a spider.Over a dozen people witness this spectacular feat... and what happens next? A lady gets miffed because some of the beer spilled on her clothes. That particular reaction sums up how amazing the entire film is. After fully realizing his powers and using them to skateboard with furious bravado outside his high school, Peter Parker (much too) quickly dons the Spidey outfit that seems more like a surfer's wetsuit than a real transformation.He seeks his uncle's murderer from the supposedly pivotal scene lacking the tragic fate of the protagonist's mentor in Sam Raimi's version. This doesn't perpetuate Parker into a vengeful vigilante misusing his powers, but gives him reason to fly around wielding his skills that actor Andrew Garfield never seems in any particular awe about. The SOCIAL NETWORK star, resembling Anthony Perkins had he become a melancholy hipster, doesn't give Peter Parker the underdog value Tobey Maguire successfully conveyed – but that's the scripts fault. Parker's not a nerd or even an outcast; having lost his parents for mysterious reasons, he's simply not a happy camper.Other than the rushed changeling into the titular superhero, there's hardly any character arc for the good guy or the villain. Osco's resident genius Dr. Curt Conner's transforms into The Lizard so quick, running amok New York City like a raptor on steroids, there's not much reason, or worthy motivation, for his actions.But (all) this lack of purpose fits a movie that, when not wallowing in romantic melodrama between Parker and girlfriend Gwen Stacey whose dad is a hard-nosed cop and a weak replacement for a much-needed human antagonist like J. Jonah Jameson doesn't live up to the original film or the comic books that at least, for better or worse, had a good time.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","hnt_dnl","1 May 2013","Hardcore fans of Sam Raimi's Spiderman can rail all they want to. THIS version of the Marvel Comics superhero, Marc Webb's THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN (2012) is BETTER! While I really did like Raimi's 2002 initial Spidey flick, I absolutely loathed the incredibly overpraised 2004 sequel. Thankfully, there is a bit more debate about which film is actually better, because I've always been in the small camp that believes Spiderman 1 is better than Spiderman 2. Part 2 regressed all the good will that Raimi built up in 1. And there is pretty much universal agreement that 3 isn't very good. But I still contend that 2 SUCKS. The huge difference that I already see in this 2012 reboot that is better than anything from the 2000s trilogy is that while the Raimi flicks TRIED and FAILED to have emotion and depth in telling the story of Peter Parker/Spiderman, Webb's reboot actually SUCCEEDS! TAS stars the pretty ""amazing"" newcomer Andrew Garfield (who was superb in The Social Network) as the well-known iconic character of Peter Parker/Spiderman. Peter is a bullied nerd whose parents mysteriously left him with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (superbly played by acting legends Martin Sheen and two-time Oscar winner Sally Field) as a child.Peter's father was a brilliant scientist working on cross-genetics technology that allows an organism to cure and re-generate itself by merging with another. Peter, a novice photographer who inherited his father's science acumen, accidentally stumbles upon some of his father's work in his Aunt and Uncle's attic, including a formula that solves the cross-genetic puzzle that his father's former colleague Dr. Curt Connors (sublimely played by Rhys Ifans) has been trying to solve for years. After sneaking into the Oscorp facility and passing himself off as an intern, Peter snoops into a lab full of test subject spiders, one of which latches onto him and bites him, giving him spider-like abilities: strength, speed, elusiveness, scales, web-shooting.Connors works for Oscorp, whose founder and leader Norman Oscorp is dying and in need of a cure, and so Connors is trying to use the cross-geneticism to accomplish this. With Peter's help, the puzzle is ""solved"" and Connors ends up using himself as the first human test subject as he has only arm, which becomes regenerated, but it also has enormous side effects, transforming him into The Lizard, Spiderman's first enemy.During this time, Peter, caught up in his work with Oscorp and bemoaning his parents' abandonment, selfishly chooses to ignore a robbery, which inadvertently leads to his Uncle Ben's death, so Peter initially uses his newfound powers to go an a rampage to find his Uncle's killer as he stalks the streets of New York on a nightly basis, bringing lowlife criminals to justice.A romance develops between Peter and his fellow high-schooler, the equally scientifically inclined Gwen Stacy (played with exquisite charm and maturity by the gifted Emma Stone). The Peter-Gwen relationship is really the heart of this film. Very beautiful and engaging. In addition to his Aunt and Uncle, Gwen actually gives Peter a purpose and direction. Even though in virtually every modern superhero film, the girlfriend always seems to find out the secret identity, this is the first film that I think does it in a truly genuine, clever, mature, and natural way, and not just for shock value or cheap effect. I dare say that the romantic aspect is really the MAIN reason why this film works, whereas in Raimi's flicks, I couldn't wait for the ""romantic"" parts to come and go to get to the action! Credit really must go to Garfield and Stone for having incredible chemistry and being terrific actors. The Raimi films are really juvenile by comparison when it comes to the realistic love story in TAS. Special mention should also go to legendary comedian Denis Leary, who does an extremely effective and refreshing turn as Gwen's father Police Captain Stacy, injecting the character with his trademark sarcasm, but also coming across as very commanding.Another thing this film does is that it literally builds Peter from the ground up as a hero, making him learn the hard way through attempts, failures, experiences, pain, loss, and gain. Even many times when Peter is wearing the suit, he still acts very human and down-to-earth. He has to LEARN how to be a hero by still using his own instincts and common sense. It's not just about looking cool scaling walls and kicking ass! Spiderman isn't Superman! The film also stages the action as realistic as possible, with a healthy dose of CG effects, of course. But, here, unlike in Raimi's films, every action scene makes sense and we get to see how Spidey must use his webs on ACTUAL surfaces! Not just magically touching the sky, the webs hit just about everything in sight: buildings, cars, windows, and even other people! Garfield is simply superb as the awkward, gifted teen-aged Peter Parker, who has led a tragic existence, but finds a purpose through the memory of his parents, his aunt and uncle, Gwen, and the innocent citizens of New York. I usually think sequels suck, but I patiently await the sequel to his underrated, under-appreciated, extremely compelling and original superhero flick!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","billygoat1071","29 June 2012","For some people, it's questionable for Spider-Man to get a reboot. The first film of Sam Raimi's version was just a decade ago and some considered it as a cult classic. Though, one might complain for not being too faithful to the comic books. The first film rushes a lot to the story. Like, Mary Jane was already the love interest and Peter Parker immediately left High School. This edition tries to be a lot more faithful to the comic book. The result is great. The film works better in the drama. The pacing may be too quick in some parts but it's still fun and heartwarming as it suppose to be.If you've already seen the 2002 version of Spider-Man then definitely you won't find a lot of thing here new. The only things that are new here is Peter Parker's father and the new ways how Spidey's powers work. Unlike the original Spider-Man stories, the use of his powers is not as simple as it looks. Here, he needs a device to shoot a web perfectly. He accidentally sticks at objects. He always cause a lot of damage. But it looks credible. What's more credible is when he wasn't quite a professional swinger at his first fights.In some parts, it paces way too quickly and sometimes it feels rushed. This happens in the third act and the montages when Peter was developing his costume. The rest is pretty fine, but the quickness of the pacing of those parts is still noticeable. There are also parts that feels forced like Dr. Conners becoming evil because he became the Lizard. Aside from those, the film is good in drama. It has plenty of genuine emotion and heart. Even in the action scenes. One thing that never fails is the message of being a hero. It's not always about fighting crimes and saving the day. It's all about the hero's character.Andrew Garfield is indeed the best choice to play Peter Parker. He's a talented actor and he made Peter Parker a realistic character. Emma Stone is also great to her role. She made her character more than just a love interest. In other filmmaking, fans might miss Danny Elfman's music but James Horner's score is effective to the scenes. The action is fun enough and the CGI is works well enough. It has plenty of POVs to make it look exciting in both 2D and 3D.The Amazing Spider-Man is almost the best Spider-Man movie. It has an incredible hero and an incredible villain living in a world that is close to reality. He is not yet professional to his own powers. He is a teenager who needs to be responsible. The drama is more effective in this film than the recent trilogy. Although I complain too much about the pacing, the depth of the story makes you think that awesome set pieces and perfect filmmaking doesn't quite matter. Because it's a superhero film that cares more than just action. The action scenes are great but the mind blowing effect here is the heart and the man behind the mask.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","mm-39","19 September 2012","The surprise hit of the summer! Everyone was looking forward to the new Batman movie this 2012 summer! Batman turnout being a bust and Spider-Man is the surprise hit Batman was not! I am tired of comic book movies. The comic book movie has become the seen it done it before with the same old C G I effects. However, I went to see the Amazing Spider-Man because people keep saying Mike you got to see this film. After avoiding Spider-man over the summer I finally saw it. What a great film. Spider-Man is a great film because the movie is excellently direct were the old story is excellent told with new twists. The actors blend the character development into the story perfectly. Martin Sheen played a perfect Uncle Ben. The 3 D effect added to the C G I and give a new excitement to the usual special effects. The same old story told in a better way. I give The Amazing Spider-Man a nine out of ten.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","aharmas","8 July 2012","Great previews usually lead to great movies, and there's a fantastic preview right before ""Spidey"". When I first heard about Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone heading this cast, I thought that it would be amazing. This film's previews looked great. Here's finally, the end product, and it's for the most part a fantastic movie, and the only criticism that we can come up with is that too bad it wasn't perfect, that the villain was well, not up to the rest of the story. Originally, the fear was that it was too soon to remake it; then you hope some good writer is part of the package (Argent) comes in, and we can see his touch, giving each of the central stars juicy lines to make them real, interesting, and endearing.Andrew Garfield is the best thing that could have happened to the franchise. His eyes are full of wonder, inquiring, able to convey a myriad of emotions in seconds, and his genuine chemistry with Stone certainly makes us care about what could happen to either one. She is not a typical damsel-in-distress, and here's a hero who can shed a few tears in the right place without looking insincere or stupid. This is particularly important in the early scenes involving the incident with his uncle, and his yearning for his long-lost father.Yet the film is a lot of fun, specially in the learning stages of his newly-acquired powers, when he can't really understand what is happening to his body. ""Chronicle"" did this effectively, but there was always an impending sense of doom. Here's only our expectations about how powerful he might become, which leads to the point of his nemesis, a terrific looking being that is well, not very threatening, particularly in this summer, full of some terrific antagonists.The special effects are fantastic, and New York hasn't looked this great in years. Watching Spiderman swing from building to building, and his little adventure in the sewer system of Gotham City is exciting. The best we can say is that here is another part that feels just right. If only Lizard Man's ego has been unleashed in the way that a few other egomaniacs have shown up recently. Remember the psychotic Joker, and that prince from another galaxy demanding respect from his ""new subjects""? I loved the claws, but if the best you can do is scratch people with it...? Back to Garfield's acting... This young man is one of the best things to come out of England/Hollywood recently. He can certainly carry a film and make it better and stronger than it might be. We want to continue seeing his adventures. Let's just give someone or something more terrifying and more threatening to go against next time.**** out *****.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","DarkVulcan29","7 July 2012","I don't want to say that this was better than the 2002 Spider Man, I think they are both good in there own right, this film does things a little bit better than the first film, but both films where good in there way.Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) a smart 19 year old, with a huge chip on his shoulder, who has a secret crush on Gwen Stacey(Emma Stone), lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May(Martin Sheen and Sally Field), still trying to figure out what happened to his parents, only to discover that his dad worked with Curt Conners(Rhys Ifans), while visiting his lab, is bitten by radioactive spider, and gains the powers of a spider. Okay there is so much more that I do not want to give away.Andrew Garfield was great as Peter Parker, I liked the way he does not try to be carbon copy of Tobey Mcguires Spider Man, but playing the part in his own way. Emma Stone was super charming as Gwen Stacey, she really brought a lot to the film, and she and Garfield have incredible chemistry. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are also great here. Not to mention Denis Leary and Rhys Ifans. And the effects don't disappoint either.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","planktonrules","25 August 2012","I can't take credit for the summary--my oldest daughter said that when we left the theater after seeing ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". That's because with all the many, many super-hero movies out in recent years, this one loses a bit of something--especially since there are clearly better films of its genre (such as ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers""). It's decent but there are better products out there.First, let's talk about what I loved. The CGI was incredible and for the first time it really looks like Spider-Man is flying. It's very seamless and looks brilliant. Also, the Spider-Man costume and movements are all great.What I thought was lacking in the film. It's ALL CGI and special effects--and nothing much more. The characters and dialog just didn't seem all that important. And because of this, it's spectacular to watch but nothing more....nothing. And, while I think about it, why, oh why didn't they include THE most important line in any Spider-Man film--Uncle Ben's line ""With great power comes great responsibility""?! It is the perfect summation of who the character is and according to Stan Lee it is Spider-Man...so why is it missing?!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","amalank","7 July 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man is supposed to be a reboot of the Spider-Man movie franchise. Tobey Maguire is replaced by Andrew Garfield in the protagonist role of Peter Parker. His main love interest switches from Mary-Jane Watson to Gwen Stacy, and the villain in this installment is Dr Curt Connors aka Lizard. As expected, this reboot goes back to the beginning when Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man only it is told in a rather different way to the 2002 movie. This time they also try to add a bit more character oriented storyline.Is it a good movie? Yes, particularly since I saw this movie in IMAX. This made the action scenes more exciting to watch. It also uses a villain that hasn't been used in the previous movies so at least it does make it different from the previous movies.Is it a successful reboot of the franchise? In my opinion, not really. It's been five years since the last Spider-Man movie came out, and ten years since the movie franchise was first introduced. Even when they made the announcement of this movie being made, I was questioning it because it's just too soon to make a reboot. For the same reason, this reboot is not refreshing. Without trying to give anything away, you can recognise that this movie takes some of the elements from the 2002 movie. The character oriented storyline doesn't add that much meat to the character of Peter Parker as its supposed to. Its easier to count this as another installment only with different actors playing the roles.I really enjoyed the first three Spider-Man movies, and yes that includes Spider-Man 3. This new Spider-Man movie is also enjoyable but it fails to refresh the series. It seems that I was right in thinking that its too soon to do so.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","phiup","9 December 2012","IMO, i think the super A plus to this movie is the realistic application of physics. It shows a more limited spiderman. He must operate within parabolic physics and they tie that into the story.I thought this spiderman was a more fun, spunkier, angstier Peter Parker. He was definitely way more nerdy than Toby Mcguire.The addition of Gwen was great and I really look forward to seeing how this franchise manages upcoming installments under the new label.Dialogue was slightly lame, key point being, ""Gwen! Gwen! I understand! Your boyfriend is a man of many masks!"" CHEESY!!!!My other knock was that it spent the entire time developing the angst of peter parker and didn't give enough development to Gwen, Aunt May, and Doc. Connor.I am a huge marvel guy, so i will continue to watch with a sense of forgiveness for the many flaws that Comic to Movie translations present.I am glad I waited for DVD because so few movies obtain that silver screen quality. If you liked this movie check out the other Marvel and DC titles. They are doing some decent work.","

The dynamic between Gwen and Pete was on point, it even brought the feels that I don't usually get. You can tell that they had good chemistry from the point they were introduced to each other, same goes for Pete and Captain Stacey wow. The dynamic was very interested, they actually had good reason to include him instead of shoehorning him into the story. I also love Martin Sheen, I actually forgot he was Martin Sheen and was just immersed by his performance of Uncle Ben. Massive props to Rhys Ifans, not only can he act but he can emote perfectly you can tell what he is thinking with his even having to say anything that was bloody good casting!I'd say that this is the best looking Spider-Man movie, yes that's included the recent Far From Home. For a start this isn't crammed with CGI, yes that is how the Lizard is done but the suit was actually made and looks great. That POV shot of him in the costume first is just amazing, the fight between him and the lizard was epic.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","freemantle_uk","11 July 2013","In a cinematic scene of superhero films and reboots one of the most controversial was The Amazing Spider-Man, the reboot of a series that was critically and commercially popular. The Amazing Spider-Man is divisive, with opinions ranging from it being the best Spider-Man film so far to being a waste of space.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a nerdy outsider who enjoys photography, inventing and skateboarding. His parents mysteriously run off in the middle of the night when he was young and he has been living with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) ever since. One evening Peter finds his father's briefcase which contents his research that he wanted to hid from mysterious forces. Peter is led to Oscorb, meeting his father's old research partner, Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) and he ends up getting bitten by a genetically altered spider giving his spider powers.When Uncle Ben is murdered on the streets Peter goes on the hunt for his killer, leading him to become Spider-man. But at the same time Connors is forced to test an experimental serum on himself, leading him to become the Lizard, a powerful creature that is a deadly threat to the whole of New York.Let's get the comparisons to the original Spider-man films out the way: the special effects are better, I preferred the hyper-realistic look of this version then the original film and Garfield is a stronger Peter Parker/Spider-man then Tobey Maguire was. But Cliff Robertson was a better Uncle Ben and Rosemary Harris was perfect as Aunt May and Field was not able to compete. On the whole I felt that the original film was generally a better origins story: I preferred that Peter was bitten by a spider in a lab visit and I especially preferred Uncle Ben's death in the original film because it had more emotional impact and handled better because Peter comes up a real dick in The Amazing Spider-Man.There are also comparisons to actual scenes and ideas between the original film and the reboot which will lead to some spoilers. We get similar scenes of Peter awkwardly using his powers when he first gets them, citizens of New York (crane lift operators) helping Spider-Man during his confrontation with the villain and Peter losing a father figure which results in Peter having to reject the woman he loves. There are even similarities between the villains as both men are scientist are forced to experiment on themselves and developed a split personality.The Spider-Man origins story is equal to Superman and Batman for well-known it is and there is less leeway for reinterpretation. I personally felt that it was a waste going through the origins story again because it is so well known, killing the pacing especially because it takes an hours before we get to see Peter Parker don the spandex. It would have been more effective if Peter Parker was Spider-Man and the origin was done in flashbacks. But once Spider-Man does show up the pacing picks up with gusto and director Marc Webb shows great confidence with the action sequences and special effects (even more impressive considering his previous film was (500) Days of Summer).As a comic book fans I would have liked to have seen Curt Connors' family, adding to the dilemma of Peter Parker trying to stop the Lizard without harming him too much and made Connors more sympathetic. I also would have preferred to see more of a snout and be a raging beast: but Ifans is talented actor and it is good to see him in a Hollywood film. Ifans did have a great sinister delivery as The Lizard.One more small criticism is some of the humour in the first half film which was weak, a little awkward and was topped off by comedy music. It was out of place for a film going for a more serious tone.Danny Elfman did supply strong scores for the first two films, particular giving the series a signatory theme tone. Whilst James Horner's score for The Amazing Spider-man does not quite those heights he still gives the new series some good music that is dramatic, soaring and triumph when needed.On the whole there are elements which The Amazing Spider-Man does improve upon the original Spider-Man whilst the original Spider-Man was better on other parts. If there was a way to blend both films together then you would properly get the perfect Spider-Man film.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","TheSquiss","6 August 2012","I have to admit I had low expectations for The Amazing Spider-Man. Yes, I enjoyed the first of Tobey Maguire's outings as Spidey back in 2002 but the quality diminished with each sequel to the point that I didn't care if a fourth installment came to fruition or not. More than anything, it was the feeling I had a mere five years after the last installment, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, of 'Why another Spider-Man so soon?' However, the decision to return to the timeline of the source comics and introduce Gwen Stacy as Peter Parker's girlfriend (instead of the more familiar Mary Jane Watson) increased the interest. Maybe this would be a new approach. Then the casting of Andrew Garfield intrigued. His superb turns in Never Let Me Go and in the more widely seen The Social Network certainly suggested he may have something new to bring to the part. The trailer clinched it for me, hinting at a Spider-Man Begins leaning. If Christopher Nolan could obliterate the camp, tarnished Adam West Batman with a completely reinvented trilogy, what could director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) create with The Amazing Spider-Man? It's not Batman Begins, let's get that straight immediately. Nolan's trilogy stands head and shoulders above all other superhero films at the moment and is unlikely to be dethroned any time soon. But The Amazing Spider-Man is a huge success and an extremely enjoyable first foray into Spidey world by all involved and this is down to some fine writing by James Vanderbilt (who has just penned next year's RoboCop reboot) and the courage of Webb not to rush into the action and villain chasing too soon.A large part of the film is spent meeting, understanding and developing a relationship with Peter Parker through his childhood, the loss of his parents, his relationship with his aunt and uncle, the death of his uncle and his decision to become the superhero and gradual evolution of his crime-fighting alter ego. We see that Peter is flawed. He's cocky at times, he's angry, emotionally wounded, damaged goods and incredibly lonely. When he's bullied at school, it isn't the obvious type of bullying that results in a dramatic conversion to prize-fighting champion, it's the slow, constant drip-drip that niggles, that eats away at confidence and distills the inner turmoil to anger that could easily become rage but veers towards sulky stubbornness and carries its own consequences.Such time is spent with the family that when Aunt May (Sally Field on fine form that surely must lead to more screen time in the sequel) rebukes Peter we, too, sit up and listen and when Uncle Ben (the ever-excellent Martin Sheen in another flawlessly strong and sincere performance) is murdered in front of his nephew, though we know it will happen and is only on a screen, it wrenches our gut and we know Peter's anguish for ourselves.When Gwen steps into Peter's life it, too, is gradual and believable. There are no great fireworks or sudden changes but a slow maturing of their friendship into something stronger. The chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone (so much more watchable here than in the good but overrated The Help earlier this year) is tangible and a pleasure to witness. They work together, they suit each other and one really hopes they stay together.Inevitably, the superhero must eventually take centre stage and the catalyst has to be an (almost) equally super villain. In this instance it's Rhys Ifans' Dr. Curt Connors, aka The Lizard, with a destructive agenda. So good has The Amazing Spider-Man been up to this point that it's almost a pity when The Lizard arrives at all. It has to happen and it brings with it an increased level of excitement and action but something dims, the quality dips slightly and it becomes a more predicable, certainly a more standard comic book flick.Ifans is dangerously close to panto villain at times but in his human form he is straight enough to offset the predictable swerves in naturalism and believability when he transmogrifies into lizard form. His make-up is better than the CGI and at times The Lizard's moves are clumsy and the facial expressions lacking in emotion. In the wide shots, however, Spider-Man's leaps and swings are far smoother and more elegant than in the Maguire years and are a minor annoyance when they are less than perfect rather than a jarring disturbance.The Amazing Spider-Man is very good indeed and I am, for the first time, looking forward to Spidey sequel but I'm guessing the real amazement will come next week when at last The Dark Knight Rises.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","cherold","15 December 2012","2002's Spider-Man was an awful movie, mainly due to an incompetent script. It was followed by the decent Spider-Man 2 but returned to form with another bad one, Spider-Man 3. That series was not the right way to do Spider-Man; this movie is the right way. While the 2002 film felt like it had been written by a committee who were neither familiar with the original material nor reading one another's work, this movie appears to have been written by people who repeatedly asked the question no one ever asked during the first series: ""does this make sense?""For the most part, Amazing Spider-Man does make sense, with a fairly convincing origin story (except for a lack of explanation as to why what happened to Peter couldn't be used to create millions of Spider-Mans). The movie takes its time as Peter transitions from dweeb to super hero, then it gets into a super-villain story that also makes sense, and (again unlike the earlier film) is exciting and well paced.The surprising thing about this movie is how serious Peter is. The tradition of the series is a wise-cracking good guy, but while Spidey does get some witty lines, the movie is better represented by the way Peter removes his mask in one scene to calm a child; it's more about the Spider-Man with a deep compassion and a need to make the world better than the Spider-Man who likes to swing through the air and beat up mutant creatures. I would have liked more wise cracking, but I appreciate the approach.Far better than the overrated The Avengers, this is a superhero movie done right. It is not the most memorable movie, and it doesn't have anything as notable as the famous upside-down kiss from the 2002 film, but it is very solid. And while in the week since I saw it most of the details have faded away, that's much better than that 2002 film, which created so many bad memories that I can still, all these years later, reel off a list of all the movie's problems.Watch this.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","ryokan_wc","13 July 2012","When i first saw the trailer of this movie last year, i thought- another Spiderman movie?, and again earlier this year- seriously, another Spiderman move?. In all honesty, i was not compelled to watch the movie- may be it was the trailer or that thought of how far can a Spiderman movie be different than the one produced about a decade ago? How 'amazing' can it be, as its title suggests?After going against the odds, i came out from the movie very pleased. In fact, i enjoyed the move thoroughly and felt very entertained. And i finally understood the word 'amazing' in the title- because it is really, pretty amazing!It is not one of those movies with excessive ZOMG factor, for sure. The movie is amazingly captured with great use of CGI. The first half of the movie explores the dark side of Peter Parker's family history in a fairly comical manner. I got to know about Peter's father, which was not much explained in the previous trilogy and i don't exactly read the comics.Then there is his high school stories of his love. The next half of the movie was gripping and fast-paced, with well angled shots to make you feel like swinging from building to building and climbing up towers- i watched it in 2D and i could still feel the height! This part of the movie focuses on the transformation of Dr Connors as the Lizard, the villain of this movie, who happens to be Peter's father's working partner. His wish to regenerate his arm goes awry, leading him to produce a biological threat that forces Spiderman to a race to save the people in the city.As i said, i was entertained. The movie was light hearted, like watching The Captain America, with brilliant cast. Andrew G performs magnificently as Peter Parker, to a certain extent, i felt him outshine Tobey M. He fits the character well. I enjoyed the scene where he first discovers of his special ability, particularly with the flipping of his skateboard. Much credits to Emma Stone, Sally Field, Martin Sheen and Rhys I, and director Marc Webb for taking the risk of rebooting this franchise. Watch out for Stan Lee in a show-stopper scene. Flash, played by Chris, gives me the feeling of a sequel where he will be featured in a bigger role- like Jacob in Twilight.Give this Spiderman a try. For a two-hour movie, this movie does not fall short and does not feel long. And a sequel is pretty likely- stay for the post-credit (duh! almost all Marvel movies has this).I have to say this one more time: The Amazing Spiderman is amazing.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","piratecannon","26 December 2012","When it was announced that a Spidey reboot was in the works, most people responded in the same way (namely, by groaning and emphasizing their contempt for Hollywood and it's lack of originality). Likewise, I thought it completely unnecessary to start from scratch, as Sam Raimi and company had crafted an admirable trilogy (the third installment being a take-it-or-leave it experience). With The Dark Knight Rises on the horizon and The Avengers having ruled the first half of the summer movie season, it seemed as if Marc Webb had accepted a fool's errand in attempting to spin a tale that, by all accounts, didn't need to be retold.Lo and behold The Amazing Spider-Man, an origins tale that's a much darker, more brooding take than its 2002 counterpart. This time around, Peter Parker is played by Andrew Garfield. Unlike Mr. Maguire, this Parker has a tangible chip on his shoulder. He's a moody teen who vividly recalls the day his parents dropped him off at Aunt May and Uncle Ben's so his scientific genius father could sort out a mysterious mess at Oscorp, only to never return. Peter has inherited his father's knack for figuring out how things work—albeit in a more mechanical sense —and, though introverted, is clearly a clever kid in his own right. As new insights about his dad's work come to light, Parker finds himself in the labs of the fabled biogenetics lab that his old man helped build. It's then that he is—wait for it!—bitten by a mutated spider.As you can see, the basic layout of The Amazing Spider-Man is very similar to what transpires in Raimi's feature. One key difference, however, is the decision to focus on Peter's father. This helps motivate Peter to embark on a quest to discover ""who he is,"" which ultimately leads him to the realization that his dad's intentions were noble. Another significant difference here is the tone; Webb and Garfield remove the slapstick comedy that made the original (the 2002 original, that is) a colorful, light-hearted affair. In its place is a decidedly more drab depiction of the Big Apple and its inhabitants, and— for my money, at least—a more compelling vision of how Parker comes into his own as the web-slinging hero of yore.So, even though there are plenty of familiar elements, the movie feels like a more mature take on Spidey that causal moviegoers and more ardent web-heads can both admire and appreciate.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","studioAT","22 July 2017","Remakes are a part of Hollywood, but even by Hollywood standards, remaking a film just over a decade after it was released is odd.But that's what happens here, with Marc Webb being charged with the responsibility of remaking the original Sam Rami film for a new (or slightly older) audience.Unfortunately there's only so many ways that you can tell the origin of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman, so in many ways this is just a carbon copy of what Rami and co had done actually quite successfully a decade earlier, and it means that audiences are playing compare and contrast throughout.Sally Field wasn't great as Aunt May, Martin Sheen was better as Uncle Ben. I didn't much care for Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker though, he seemed too cool for the role.The break out star though is Emma Stone, and it's a shame she's not in in it more.A fairly harmless remake, but you can't help but think that this has been done better before...because it has.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Quinoa1984","9 July 2017","Once again we get the origin story of Peter Parker becoming the Spider-Man. Once again we get Gwen Stacy, though this time its a substantial character (something that even I'll say, as one of a handful of big fans, was a problem in Spider-Man 3). Once again we get a scientist who meddles too much into his own business and finds that what it changes him into is a living nightmare. And once again we have a teenager who can throw out the occasional quip - though Garfield's Parker is more jerkish in some of his comments than Maguire ever was - while taking out the bad guys, whomever they are. Oh, and of course we get to see (spoiler? no, not a spoiler, screw you, this is 50+ years old now) Uncle Ben dies. Derp.As I recall from watching this movie, the (must qualify here) first 'reboot/remake' of the Spider-Man franchise from Sony, on DVD right after it came out - I skipped it in theaters, probably I was too busy working that summer or something, I can't remember - is that this wasn't any crime against humanity, and it was probably more watchable and understood its world a little better than, say, Trank's Fantastic Four or the majority of something like Batman v Superman). Webb, pun intended, does a competent job with the character stuff involving Garfield and Stone, albeit I'd rather see them as a couple in a totally different film, so that one can excuse the action from being rote.At the same time, this also solidified my belief that, if movies last this long, we can go another, oh, 55/60 years before needing another Uncle Ben death scene again. Or, for that matter, Peter Parker in a skateboarding slo-mo shot. It's too same-old to stand-out from the pack, but full of too much personality to be a train-wreck or a fun disaster. It's a perfectly eh-OK-ish blockbuster, and despite this rating and a lot of game supporting players (Sally Field, Irfan Khan, Rhys Ifans... got paid I guess). I'll never see it again intentionally.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","troy-manatunga","27 November 2012","Let's begin on a positive note shall we?THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 is been booked for release for the 2nd of May 2014. Marc Webb is indeed spinning this web absolutely stylishly as the viewers want it to be. Personally this reinvention comes too soon to the wide screen following the Tobey Maguire trilogy that unfolded in 2002.The base behind the reinvention of one of marvels greatest superheroes isn't a complex algorithm as the one created by Peter Parker himself in THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. It is referred to as the filming industry and if the financial potential is great why not make an extra buck? It would not come as a surprise to see Christian Bale hand down the cape to another crusader even as Nolan wraps up BATMAN.Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1962 and as cleverly done by Raimi before, THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN is a differently narrated story of Peter Parker. As in the past his super powers are a result of a nasty bite from a radioactive happy spider and he is brought up under the guardianship of Aunty May and Uncle Ben. This is the only similarity one may draw from the Raimi Trilogy every frame of the movie from that point forward is a new spidey experience.Andrew Garfield is trusted with the daunting challenge of filling into the spidey suit from Toby Maguire. It has been a few years since and the old spidey isn't a neither forgotten nor lost memory apart from the 3rd movie that clearly lost its way (sorry Raimi fans, but you know it's true!). Lanky and tall Andrew is the skinny kid who wakes up to find him evolving into something greater. Loyal to the original comics (That I have owned myself) created by Lee and Ditko, Garfield strikes when the iron is hot with a lovable underdog that is Peter Parker. Outgoes the clueless girl from next door (AKA Mary J Watson) and enters college girl Gwen Stacey. Unlike the Peter Jane love story of 2002 the 2012 version of the Peter Gwen Chemistry is more often sidelined to allow time for Spiderman to try and save the day. This may come as a disappointment to some however this works in the benefit of the superhero. So do not expect the famous upside down kiss this time round folks, it ain't gonna happen! Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin is retired. The Lizard takes center stage as the new nemesis. Whilst Nano technology and providing weapons to the military was the business of Oscorp industries back then, this time it is a more noble cause that leads to destructions much like in THE RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. Dr.Connors is working on a formula to find a breakthrough in medicine. Dr.Connors connection and history with Peters father draw light to certain lose ends that Raimi failed to tie up in his trilogy. The fans will absolutely be thrilled with this exposure of Peters Past.THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN is an action filled extravaganza. It does miss out on certain trademarks such as ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" etc, instead it falls back to basics of the comics itself. Webb picked up on minute details of the superhero that Raimi skipped to iterate on. The webbing device was originally written by Lee and Ditko as a Parker creation and this is honored in THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. A must watch movie of 2012 and is on par with the 2002 production. The obvious question I need to answer is what movie I prefer better. To me THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN tops the predecessor by a minimum of a half start rating. Why? Simply because there is more Spiderman and much less Peter Parker.TITLE: THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN DIRECTED BY: MARC WEBB STARRING: ANDREW GARFIELD, EMMA STONE and RHYS IFANS RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 136 MINUTES","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","japamo","26 November 2013","Initially, like many people, my knee-jerk response to ""The Amazing Spiderman"" (hereafter TAS) was ""unnecessary and redundant"". I felt that Tobey Maguire's interpretation on the famed arachnoid (and Peter Parker) was thoroughly satisfying and complete. Therefore, I didn't bother seeing TAS at the Cineplex. But recently on cable, Encore was periodically showing TAS and, eventually giving into my curiosity, sat down one Saturday morning to give TAS a chance. Now I wish I had seen TAS in the movie theatre. Although it covers the usual Spidey origin trajectory (nerdy but brainy loner, loving aunt/uncle, bite from genetically altered spider, subsequent infusion of powers and confidence, emergence of outlandish but deadly villain), I think TAS does a more touching, affecting, and dare I say it, grittily realistic depiction of Spiderman, and more importantly, Peter Parker.Too often, superheroes eclipse their alter egos and give us the often mistaken impression that without their powers, they are nobodies (""Hero to Zero"", you might say). Many superhero movies seem to reflect that impression and somewhat rush the origin story so that we can get to the exciting hero as quickly as possible. I think Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman"" did that to some extent, acknowledging but accelerating Maguire's Peter Parker angst, sorrow, and alienation so that people didn't feel too down and could get to see their high-swinging, inspirational hero as soon as possible. Director Mark Webb's TAS takes more deliberate, measured time in revealing Spidey because I think he wants the audience to realize that Peter Parker is an amazing kid way before the fateful spider gets to him.So instead of rushing through the tense high school drama to get to college, as Maguire's Parker did, Andrew Garfield's Parker remains in high school and emotionally, uncomfortably, but convincingly reminds us how harrowing that environment can be, especially to a reserved, sometimes inarticulate loner and orphan. And yet, Peter is far from pathetic. In TAS, he is a skilled photographer and skateboarder. He is also an accomplished science student, and he proves it when he deciphers his late parents' science papers, formulas, and algorithms, especially the missing formula that completes amputee Dr. Curtis Connor's (Rhys Ifans's) successful but horrifyingly reptilian tissue regeneration. Of course, unlike Maguire's Spidey's organic webs, Garfield's Parker devises the web fluid and dispensers himself. Furthermore, Garfield's Parker conducts extensive research to learn why, as a 4-year old (Max Charles), he was left with his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), and begins to uncover an intricate connection between his parents, Oscorp, and Dr. Connors (and a mysterious stranger).Garfield, however, is careful not to make Parker into a perfect goody-goody. Perhaps because of his ""abandonment"" by his parents, Parker has rebellious, mischievous tendencies that would lure him into juvenile delinquency if not for his uncle/aunt and a potential love interest, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Parker can also be irresponsible, spiteful, and distracted, which leads to that life-altering, emotionally shattering family tragedy involving Uncle Ben. Although basically polite and respectful, Parker manages to antagonize and disconcert Gwen's father, Police Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) who (like Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson in Raimi's film), considers Spiderman a selfish, dangerous vigilante, despite Parker's earnest protests.Nevertheless, I think Parker earns the audiences admiration as he begins to rise above his shortcomings and use his natural talents (with a little help with his spider powers) to balance, juggle, and reconcile his personal, romantic, and ""professional"" problems. In fact, I believe that Parker is such an intriguing character on his own, the movie would still be involving and entertaining even if Parker tackled his problems without his powers. As Uncle Ben's posthumous voicemail on Parker's cell phone mentions, Peter was always destined for great things. The spider powers just make his life a little more interesting.P.S.: Commenting upon the Lizard's appearance in the movie, I personally had no complaints. As a cross between a Komodo dragon and the Hulk, the Lizard sported a too-human face, according to some detractors. I think that was essential to convey the Lizard's/Dr. Connors latent, if somewhat misguided, humanity and his final, merciful treatment of Parker/Spiderman. If the Lizard had had to speak and show his feelings with a snout like, say, a Velociraptor, I think it would have less effective, and even a bit laughable.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","colm-hearne365","3 September 2012","Like a lot of people, I didn't like how they were starting the Spider- Man movies from the beginning again but when I heard that it would be more true to the comics, I really began to look forward to it and it really lived up to my expectations with its cast, script, action and directing. But I still enjoy the original Spider-Man trilogy, except Spider-Man 3 which disappointed many fans. But I can admit even the first two movies got cheesy at times, particularly the acting and directing. And I've even heard that some people didn't like the trilogy for how campy they were or how untrue to the comics they were.But I mean I thought Tobey Maguire was too weak and didn't really fit the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he acted too much like a geek. Kirsten Dunst was a good choice for Mary Jane but as the movies went on she became annoying and selfish, especially in the third one and I didn't like how she acted so helpless.But I really think, like most people, that Andrew Garfield is amazing as Spider-Man/Peter Parker because he fits the character better and more importantly he's a better actor. And I love how he acted more of a wiseguy, which Spider-Man is supposed to be. And Emma Stone was an even better lead lady as Gwen Stacy because she actually helped out. And Rhys Ifans did very well and maybe even kind of intimidating as Dr. Connors/The Lizard. The battle scenes and special effects are amazing with The Lizard and Spider-Man were really exciting and had me at the edge of my seat.Some of the thing that makes this movie better than the 2002 one, is that it has more to do with Peter's parents, who were never mentioned in the trilogy. And we actually get to see Uncle Ben get shot. And there more funny parts as well. The Stan Lee cameo was the funniest. And of course, the story of is more true to the comics as well. I know some people found The Amazing Spider-Man disappointing or they prefer the original trilogy but I think people should be giving this movie more credit even though some parts were kind of similar to the Spider-Man of 2002. But I mean it's like the Spider-Man version of Batman Begins, in fact it probably should be on IMDb's Top 250 if The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises. I mean it's much gritter, funnier, and more mature and more realistic than the trilogy.Not to mention it's one of the most anticipated and best movies of 2012. I see a bright future for our fellow wall-crawler and hopefully he'll get to be in The Avengers.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","claudio_carvalho","10 November 2012","The trilogy of the Spider-Man by Sam Raimi is very faithful to the comic book's hero from my childhood. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not a bad movie, but is a fast-paced reinvention of the hero and therefore I was a little disappointed with the story.Peter Parker is no longer the outcast nerd that is bullied by everyone at high-school and needs to work to support his beloved Aunt May. He dates Gwen and immediately discloses his identity to her. After discovering that he has superpowers, he immediately jumps from the top of a building in a reckless attitude. He does not also grieve the loss of his Uncle Ben. There are many other differences regarding the original Spider-Man.The best that this film offers are the top-notch special effects that are very impressive. The story is only reasonable and I prefer Sam Raimi's movies. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Espetacular Homem-Aranha"" (""The Spectacular Spider- Man"")","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","jeddjong","26 June 2012","After Spider-Man 3 became something of a critical and commercial letdown and plans for a sequel fell through, the folks at Marvel Entertainment and Columbia Pictures developed a case of itchy reboot button syndrome and immediately put The Amazing Spider-Man into production to swing in and save the franchise. Many fans rolled their collective eyes and the web was abuzz with fiery opinions. Early looks and promotional materials seemed generally underwhelming, and the film quickly became buried by bigger releases such as The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises and Prometheus. However, this spider has become something of a dark horse and has somehow risen to greet detractors with a shot of webbing to the face.In spite of the poor first impressions, one would be hard-pressed not to admit that The Amazing Spider-Man is actually a competently-made, enjoyable flick. The approach that the aptly-named director Marc Webb of (500) Days of Summer fame took brings to mind last year's surprise hit Marvel flick X-Men: First Class, in that in combines the youthful appeal of teen drama with relatively large-scale super heroics and action sequences. This film does not repeat the mistakes of Spider-Man 3 – instead, we have character development and interaction and clear and easy-to-follow plot progression. Spider-Man has always been a hero all readers could relate to, with his transition from outcast to hero and his various personal, real-world struggles. Andrew Garfield, sexy nerd incarnate, is an ace casting choice. The actor has said that playing Spider-Man has been his dream since he was a young boy and the role went to the right guy. Garfield has an effortless, genuine charm and his slightly lanky proportions do seem very reminiscent of the Peter Parker of the comics, particularly the Ultimate version. For all the strengths of Tobey Maguire's interpretation of the character, Garfield's somehow rings more true. Whether he's being a smart-mouthed do-gooder, a teen sorting out his issues with his well-meaning aunt and uncle or a young lover unsure of how to go about a relationship with his dream gal, Garfield is in great form.Speaking of his dream gal, Emma Stone does a similarly good job of playing Gwen Stacy. Many were confused after Stone was cast and then announced as playing a different character from Kirsten Dunst's. Gwen did pop in Spider-Man 3 played by Bryce Dallas-Howard, and is touted as Parker's first love. In an interview, Stone states that ""Mary Jane fell in love with Spider-Man, but Gwen Stacy fell in love with Peter Parker"". Gwen is smart, kind and funny, surely what every guy looks for in a girl, and her role in the story is just the right size. Sure enough, the chemistry between Stone and Garfield is among the strongest of on screen couples in recent memory and it's no surprise that the couple continued their romance off the set.One has to feel bad for Dylan Baker who portrayed Dr Curt Connors in Spider-Man 2 and 3 but never got the chance to transform into the Lizard after the cancellation of a fourth entry in Raimi's series. Rhys Ifans fills those shoes, and he marshals a tragic figure who hopes to better society and to fix his own perceived physical flaw. This definitely will push the excellent actor further into public consciousness, and he does a decent job. However, Connors' split-second snap from rational scientist to raving mad supervillain does seem a tad rushed and the design of the Lizard, as has been stated before, is pretty goofy. Also, the relationship between Connors and Parker, while given some attention here, could have benefited from a little mo re.The rest of the supporting cast is good too. Martin Sheen is easy to buy as the earnest, down-to-earth uncle and father figure who serves as an upstanding role model to his nephew, and so is Sally Field as his concerned, protective wife May. Casting these veteran film industry stalwarts was certainly a good move, especially since this retelling doesn't particularly focus on the two but does convey their involvement in Peter's life. Denis Leary is also well-cast as the Inspector Javert-type Captain Stacy, who could have been an over-the-top, ""squash Spider-Man dead!"" figure. Instead, Leary makes him a stern but well-meaning authority figure and gives him a good dynamic with his daughter and Peter. His resemblance to Willem Dafoe, aka Green Goblin from the first Spider-Man film, is a little distracting though.In terms of aesthetics, the movie looks sleek and dramatic – director Webb uses his ample experience shooting music videos in the right way. While it could have been something like the horrid Catwoman movie, there is instead clever use of lighting and composition and the action sequences are kinetic yet coherently-shot. This reviewer isn't a giant fan of the costume, produced by the people at Cirque du Soleil (really) and the afore-mentioned facial features of the Lizard. The large amounts of digital effects supplied mostly by Sony Pictures Imageworks (also responsible for last year's Green Lantern film) are also a cut or so below expectations for a big-budget superhero movie, but these don't significantly hurt the end result.The film brings up the issue of Peter's parents but never fully addresses it, with a slightly ham-fisted mid-credits sequel hook hinting at what is to come. The Amazing Spider-Man has been marketed as ""the untold story"", which is rather bold given that it's only been ten years since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and five years since Spider-Man 3. Still, it defies expectations and is thoroughly entertaining. Untold story? Not quite, but well-told story? Definitely.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Prismark10","29 August 2014","Sam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy began in 2002 and a decade later we have the reboot with Andrew Garfield's more geeky hipster take replacing Tobey Maguire.However the film feels pointless, we have another origins story with Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider and learns to harness his new powers and then the tragedy of Uncle Ben dying and realising that with his new powers comes great responsibility.The villain here is a Green Lizard instead of the Green Goblin, a man wanting to regrow his arm but the experiment goes horribly wrong.The police pursue Spider Man as they believe he is a menace and Parker has a touching and believable relationship with Gwen Stacy whose father is the policeman pursuing Spidey.The film is well made, slightly darker hued after the rebooted Dark Knight films, a good mix of action special effects and humour although the CGI lizard could had been better but the film feels empty despite the efforts of Andrew Garfield.A soulless film made solely so Columbia Pictures can retain the rights to make Spider Man films.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","buffingtondakota","2 January 2022","Really enjoyed this film. Obviously, this is a different take on Spider-Man than Maguire's or Holland's version. However, I don't see anything wrong with this version of Spider-Man. Honestly, I think this film is superior to the Maguire films; especially taking out of consideration nostalgia. First, the special effects are far superior in this film than they were in all 3 Maguire films, combined. Second, the story telling was way more in-depth and fully realized. The creators drive into Peter Parker's parents story/history. They give Aunt May & Uncle Ben a more relatable and fully realized story. The focus on how Peter Parker creates/becomes Spider-Man in a more ""real"" way, by showing him creating the web-shooters and costume using ""real life resources"", instead of in Maguire's version how he just magically made it himself with no comprehension to the audience why or how and the nonsensical bodily web-shooters lol. The relationships between the actors/characters feel organic and natural, and not at all awkward or forced like in Maguire's films. It truly felt like watching a comic book on screen rather than watching a big-budget Hollywood movie try to fame a beloved hero. This film felt like a DC/Batman movie at times, but not in a rip off way just coincidental way. Andrew Garfield gets a lot of slack for being the ""lesser"" Spider-Man, but honestly he was fantastic and played the character well. All of the actors played the characters well. I would strongly recommend giving this movie another chance and try to separate it from the nostalgic Tobey Maguire ""Spider-Man"" films. I had fun watching it and truly appreciated the hard work that went into creating this story/film.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Leofwine_draca","16 April 2014","I'm a bit ambivalent towards superhero films. Sure, they offer crowd-pleasing entertainment, but most of them turn into CGI monstrosities devoid of originality and wit long before the ending, and unfortunately the same thing happens with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN. And that's without mentioning that this is an entirely redundant remake of the Sam Raimi original, which only came out about a decade ago.See, I liked the Raimi trilogy of Spiderman flicks. Raimi brought his own directorial quirks to the films, making them slightly campy and a whole lot of fun. Here, it's all about earnestness, which is dull, and it quickly becomes obvious that director Marc Webb (a made-up name, surely?) has little experience of handling this kind of expensive material.Andrew Garfield has a knack for picking slightly irritating characters and that knack is evidence in his Peter Parker, who lacks the decency that Tobey Maguire brought to the role. The whole high school schtick is faintly embarrassing to sit through, but it gets worse about halfway through when the plot dissolves to be replaced by one CGI-laden action sequence after another. They're all silly and predictable, lacking the kind of choreography that a director like, say, Christopher Nolan, would bring to them.There's little else to enjoy along the way, either. I didn't like Kristen Dunst in the Raimi trilogy, but Emma Stone is hardly better, a bland blonde bimbo and nothing more. Rhys Ifans is impossible to take seriously as the bad guy, while old-timers Martin Sheen and Sally Field have very little to work with. There's no great insight into the characters or anything like that; in fact, this is just a kid's film that anyone older than a teenager will struggle to enjoy.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","jamieradford","27 December 2012","I must admit I wasn't expecting much from The Amazing Spiderman. I knew the special effects would be great, but I had my doubts whether Marc Webb would be able to add anything new and interesting to the Spiderman franchise, particularly since it has only been a few years since the Sam Raimi version was in theaters.Well he did, and he didn't.The casting of Andrew Garfield as Spiderman/Peter Parker was a great choice. Gone is the klutzy and nerdy Peter Parker played by Toby Maguire in the Sam Raimi version. In his place is a normal kid (although very intelligent), who while not being the most popular student at his school is not the class dork either.This version of Spiderman also concentrates more on what happened to Peter's parents, and the effect that has had on him. The discovery by Peter of his father's suitcase and the ensuing investigation, is what leads him to becoming Spiderman. This investigation into his parents' disappearance will apparently be one of the common threads that will tie in future installments of Webb's Spiderman.Gone also was The Daily Bugle, J Jonah Jameson and Mary Jane Watson, and although they will all return in The Amazing Spiderman 2, due out in 2014, I did miss the rantings of JJJ, portrayed so wonderfully well by J. K. Simmons in the previous version.Marc Webb has instead used Gwen Stacey as Peter's love interest in his adaptation, played very service-ably by Emma Stone, and to be honest the chemistry between Stone and Garfield is much better than that between Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, who played Spiderman and MJW respectively in the Sam Raimi films.Denis Leary who is always good joins the cast as Gwenn's father – police Captain Stacey, and as is becoming a trend in super hero movies, big name actors are playing the parts of the hero's parents, or in this case uncle and aunt, with Sally Field and Martin Sheen taking on the roles of Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Both, as usual give very polished performances.The excellent Rhys Ifans plays the one armed Dr Curt Conners, who used to work with Peter's father at Oscorp until he disappeared, and since then has been struggling to complete their work on cross species genetics on his own; unable to discover the final equation that will allow it to go forward.Peter supplies Conners with the equation, and following pressure from his boss at Oscorp tests the formula on himself. Of course it has unintentional side effects, and as well as repairing his lost arm, turns him into a giant lizard who then wreaks havoc throughout New York; as well as trying to turn everyone else in the city into creatures like himself.And the battle between Spiderman and the Lizard begins. As expected the special effects are great, and although I am not usually a fan of 3D, I highly recommend seeing The Amazing Spiderman in that format if possible, as the scenes of him swinging through New York are (no pun intended) amazing.Marc Webb has done a fine job. There are holes in the script and story, but they are not that noticeable, and it can get a bit clichéd at times, but these things are to be expected in a big budget film such as this; however they can also be forgiven.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman, and am looking forward to the next installment of Marc Webb's version, which at this stage will see Jamie Foxx playing the villain Electro and is due out in 2014.7.5 out of 10","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","BA_Harrison","6 April 2015","Marvel wipe the slate clean to reboot their Spiderman franchise after the dreadful mess that was Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. This time around, it is Andrew Garfield playing teenager Peter Parker, who develops incredible spider powers—super strength, acrobatic skills and the ability to climb sheer walls—after being bitten by a genetically modified arachnid. When his Uncle Ben is shot and killed by a convenience store thief, Parker builds himself a pair of neat-o web-slinging devices, makes a natty outfit, and goes looking for the murderer. Meanwhile, one-armed scientific genius Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) creates a serum designed to regrow his missing limb, but which accidentally turns him into a hulking great CGI lizard in the process.While this reboot isn't quite as terrible as the third Raimi film, neither is it good enough to warrant starting things all over again. The script fumbles the origins of Spidey and feels utterly contrived (Parker being able to build web-shooters thanks to a handy synthetic material invented by Oscorp, student Gwen Stacey working part-time at Oscorp, those crane drivers helping Spidey to swing across town, Gwen rustling up an antidote to Connor's serum in a matter of minutes), Andrew Garfield proves nowhere near as likable as Tobey Maguire in the role, and Mark Webb's direction leaves a lot to be desired: I didn't care about any of his characters and his forgettable action scenes are over-reliant on unconvincing CGI.I have yet to see The Amazing Spiderman 2, but the fact that the character is getting yet another reboot in 2017 just goes to show that this particular incarnation isn't doing the trick.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","paulclaassen","5 October 2020","Although I probably should review 'The Amazing Spider-Man' as a standalone film, I can't help myself from comparing it to 2002's 'Spider-Man', since it is a reboot after all.Here are some of the major differences in the story: Peter Parker's love interest is Gwen (a character who first appeared in 'Spider-Man 3'). For some reason they decided to omit the Mary Jane character, as well as Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn. Peter's Aunt and Uncle doesn't nearly have the same characterizations as the original characters, whom I so loved in the first trilogy. They've also entirely cut Mr Anderson, a character so incredibly well portrayed by JK Simmons. Also, according to 'The Amazing Spider-Man', Spider-Man's webs are not entirely natural. Instead, Peter designed a device to properly utilize it, and there's even a flashing red light when he uses it...!!Andrew Garfield is a fantastic actor and I really enjoy watching him. As for the Spider-Man character in this film, though, he comes across as immature - even whilst in Spider-Man outfit (no, actually, especially when in Spider-Man outfit). Speaking of immature, Peter reveals his identity way too soon to Gwen - before they were even going steady as a couple. Their love story just wasn't believable (or engaging) enough. The film also has significantly more humor, which doesn't come across naturally funny as it did in the original. I found some of the humorist elements distracting and annoying.As for the action sequences, there wasn't really anything that blew me away. Much of the film's action scenes were completely CGI, and clearly so. With a running time of 136 minutes, the film dragged at times with uninteresting scenes. There were way too little actual Spider-Man action. This played like a drama with Spider-Man along for the ride.Rhys Ifans stars as Dr Connors, who becomes the villain The Lizard. While I have mixed feelings about this villain, it wasn't entirely bad, although maybe leaning a bit more towards the horror genre than fantasy. In its entirety, the film was entertaining from various perspectives. Andrew Garfield certainly made it worth the watch, thanks to his natural acting. Compared to the original 'Spider-Man', though, I favor the latter.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","moviexclusive","25 June 2012","Ten years might seem too soon to reboot a franchise, but after the bloated and lacklustre 'Spiderman 3', going back to basics isn't that bad an idea after all. That's exactly what 'The Amazing Spiderman' does, booting out previous franchise stalwarts Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco for up-and-coming director Marc Webb (with only the indie feature '500 Days of Summer' under his belt) and similarly on-the-up stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. It's a bold move all right, but in this instance, one that pays off handsomely in the form of an enormously entertaining blockbuster piece of entertainment that we dare say surpasses the original.To be sure, this isn't quite 'the untold story' that the pre-publicity machine sold it as. Rather, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves (with story credit to Vanderbilt) re-assemble the key elements of Peter Parker's origin story for a fresh new take on the familiar. So once again, Peter is the nerdy and socially awkward teenager who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, who one day gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and develops superhuman powers, who uses his powers for play until his Uncle Ben gets killed, and then is thrust into a quest for justice to hunt down the killer that ultimately leads him to recognise the responsibility which comes with possessing such powers.Like we said, this is no mere rehash, and both Webb and his team of writers find opportunities at every turn to expand and adjust the little details that make a difference. Parker's father for instance plays a much more central role to the narrative, and the crucial wrestling episode between Parker and opponent Bonesaw McGraw in Sam Raimi's original is reduced with a wink to a brief moment that inspires his Spidey mask. More significantly, Webb tones down the comic-book feel of Raimi's original and goes the way of recent superhero movies by injecting a stronger dose of drama into the material.Though Parker's abandonment issues have always featured in the 'Spiderman' films, Webb's spin on it is by far the most emotionally poignant, drawing an intimate link with Parker's identity crisis that forms the backbone of the story. Indeed, that's also how the film's villain, Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), has been sketched. Both hero and adversary are characters isolated in their own way- two sides of the same coin if you may- not so different from the dynamic between Batman and the Joker in Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.Nonetheless, fans can rest easy that Webb doesn't take his movie down a similarly dark and gloomy path- instead, there is much cheer and spark in the romance between Parker and classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who proves to be a much more interesting character than Mary-Jane Watson ever was in three films. That's undoubtedly a result of the chemistry between reel-turned-real life sweethearts Garfield and Stone, but a key difference here is that Stacy is no longer just the sweet girl-next-door but a smart and sassy individual perfectly capable of being Parker's intellectual equal. Their romance has the zing of Webb's earlier 'Summer', and more than justifies why the commercials director was chosen over so many others to take the helm of this movie.Webb also has much fun with Parker's discovery of his newfound superhuman capabilities before the film takes a more decidedly serious tone- and a subway scene where the lanky teenager easily overpowers five other burly men in the same carriage (while ripping the clothes off another lady passenger) is neatly choreographed and adroitly staged. Ditto another where he hijacks a car-jacking thief in action (briefly seen in the trailers), which also marks the start of a tongue-in-cheek move he makes whenever some villain refuses to shut up or confess. In between the intricate webs of romance, comedy and drama, Webb weaves in another layer of action that perfectly complements the earlier elements. The first major setpiece on the Williamsburg Bridge sets the tone for the rest to follow- eschewing all-out spectacle for more emotionally-driven thrills- culminating in a harrowing rescue of a young boy from a burning car hanging off the side of the bridge that proves to be unexpectedly moving. Likewise the climactic sequence set atop a New York skyscraper (similarity to 'The Avengers' aside) has more emotional beats than you would expect- in particular relating to Spiderman's status as a masked vigilante- and ends on a surprisingly sombre note that brings the human dimensions of the tale to a fully satisfying finish.A huge reason why Webb's drama-centric approach works is the excellent casting. There's no other way to describe it than to say that Garfield is brilliant as Parker/ Spiderman. He nails the tongue-in-cheek one- liners, and navigates the character beats between tortured teenager and born-again superhero with admirable ease. We've said this before, but we'd mention it again- his scenes with Stone sparkle with verve. And not unlike Raimi's original, his scenes with supporting leads Martin Sheen and Sally Field provide some of the most heartwarming moments in the movie. To compare Garfield's performance with that of Maguire's is inconsequential really, and it suffices to say that Garfield brings a different, but no less unique, personality to the iconic character.Indeed, the same can be said of the film as a whole, reassembling the familiar elements of Spiderman's origin story into a refreshing blend of action and emotion. Working off the template of Raimi's original and inspired by recent character-driven superhero movies, Webb delivers an emotionally thrilling and adrenaline-pumping blockbuster that counts amongst one of the best Marvel page-to-screen adaptations. And unlike post-conversion efforts, the decision to shoot in 3D ensures that the POV shots of Spiderman swinging down Fifth Avenue or battling the Lizard atop the Oscorp skyscraper are positively vertiginous, adding an additional dimension of excitement especially when viewed in IMAX.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","jkb851","12 August 2013","Many years ago, Stan Lee crafted a story with, perhaps the worlds most beloved superhero. Spiderman is the story of Peter Parkers life. It's the quintessential story capturing all essences of humanity, loss and life. A must for anyone human being to empathise with. The story of a teenager, not extremely social (who really), smart, bullied, has to suffer loss of family (his uncle) and is to be how you want to.This interpretation of that beloved story is brilliant! The direction is brilliant, soundtrack is great in my opinion and Andrew Garfield makes a fantastic Peter Parker, and his performance is well complimented with all the other likable cast.Even with it's drawbacks, the movie is great fun! :)","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Loving_Silence","17 July 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the best movies of 2012, so far. Great chemistry between the 2 actors, fantastic visual effects, memorable action scenes and a a new level of emotional depth, not seen in a Spider-Man movie. The movie constantly delivers on character development and thrilling action sequences. My low expectations were obliterated, what a surprise! Aside from the 3D animation looking fantastic and the film having a dark, complex feel to it that makes it feel more grown up, the primary reason worth watching is Andrew Garfield. Andrew Garfield was terrific as Spider-Man, he not only looks like Peter Parker, but he embodies the character. Something only a few actors are able to do. Emma Stone is, as always very charming and effective in her role as Gwen Stacy. The chemistry between them is so well done, and performed. The scenes between them truly elevate the film, as a whole. Uncle Ben, played by the veteran actor Martin Sheen. Sheen brings the intrinsic qualities of family love and togetherness to the movie. Rhys Ifans is great as Dr. Connors, although I felt he was a bit underused. Everyone works so well together, the cast is by far the best out of all the Spidey movies, yet. In many ways it represents an improvement over the Raimi films, particularly the misbegotten third installment, especially in its emphasis on the adolescent nature of its protagonist. Though Garfield is 28, he makes a credible 17-year-old - although Maguire was a year younger when he first pulled on the tights a decade ago, his Parker seemed conspicuously adult. The action scenes and the visual effects are totally exhilarating, believable and totally engrossing. Even though this reboot may be unnecessary, now I can't wait until The Amazing Spider-man 2. I sort of hate comparing this to the original trilogy because it is trying to be its own thing, but you can't escape the fact that it's such a recent reboot. However the movie stands on its own, as great reboot and a pleasure to watch! ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has everything you could ask from a summer movie. Action, romance, imagination and smart writing. 9/10","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","cricketbat","10 July 2018","When I first heard about this reboot, I wondered ""Why?"" Then, after seeing some press about it, I decided to give it a chance. After seeing the movie, I can now confidently say, ""Why?"" Don't get me wrong, I think Andrew Garfield makes an excellent Spider-Man and I always like seeing Emma Stone act, but this movie doesn't really add anything new to the franchise. In fact, at times it feels like the same movie as the first Spider-Man. I like The Amazing Spider-Man, but it's not really that. . .wait for it. . .amazing. Boom! See what I did there?","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","barok_232","14 July 2012","This movie is a cash-in.First thing that occurred to me was that I previously saw everything worth watching in the movie's trailer.For example, note that Spidey's swinging scenes which are spread out in the trailer ended up being one scene in the movie (the crane scene)!Also,I didn't see ONE new bit of action in the movie that I hadn't already seen in the trailer and if I did,it was not a highlight.It really gets on my nerves when Hollywood manages to fool me with an impressive trailer that I am going to see a good movie, only to discover that it's far from that.It is more than obvious that everyone's eyes are on the Parker character, played by Garfield.I believe he did a decent job with what he was given and if at times there was some awkwardness with the character,it wasn't his fault.The bad thing is at some points I got a ""Harry Potter"" feeling by him.The rest of the cast did well,Stone was great and cute,Field and Sheen felt like cameo appearances just to help the film sell more(although happy to have seen them),Leary was very fitting to the role of captain Stacey and Ifans was sufficient as Connors(again he did nothing wrong,not his fault that his character was poorly developed). I also got a question here: would a half-arm person lift his sleeve up to the point where his rest arm is shown unless he is a beggar on the street? I think not.As for the Peter-Gwen romance,it was cute but I honestly think it never got deep emotionally.The movie also failed to explain to me why Gwen got attracted to Peter.The film is about Peter trying to find the truth about his parents. I honestly couldn't care less.And besides,there are only repeated references of that matter and no actual clues to follow,another cheat sponsored by the trailer.The rest of the film focuses on Peter getting bitten by the spider (since the movie is a reboot) and then on the lizard matter. Comparing with the original Spiderman(Sam Raimi's) at this point is inevitable. The question is raised: is there anything more they could possibly tweak/alter? Couldn't they stick to the comic plot at all? It's as if they are changing everything no matter what.The result was to go worse everywhere since the Raimi version did amazingly well with Spidey's story.Huge example is uncle Ben's death.What was that?No guilt was established for Peter as nobody in the audience would assume Peter was obliged to stop the thief and Ben's death had no actual impact on him,just a shallow crying scene over Ben lying on the sidewalk. Since they like to alter things so much, I say, let Ben live in this one flick!Connors is underdeveloped,so his motives are not clear,lizard wants to turn everybody like himself, although able to talk (with fantastic pronunciation!!!)and be sane.I don't get if there is a second persona or a crazy Connors behind the lizard,the film doesn't really explain and the scene where Connors hears the lizard talk to him only complicates things more.The director,in order to promote this film,boasted that this film uses very little cgi technology if any.That is a big lie.Not only there is extensive use of cgi, it's actually also very bad.I can't comment further on this matter as it is something one has to realize on his own.What gives it away is motion,colors are OK. Gravital issues also occur as the lizard sometimes appears to be really heavy(Hulk-Godzilla-like)and at other scenes he climbs and jumps like a feather. The only action scene I enjoyed in its entirety was the car thief scene. There is no cgi there as far as I'm concerned and it is a very enjoyable scene overall(Garfield's humorous lines help too).The flaw there is how the heck did so many police cars get there so quick!.At this point I want to comment about the suit.I really hate it.Had there not been the Spiderman mask,I would never recognize the man wearing this suit as Spiderman.Mechanical (-electrical?) web shooters are indifferent although faithful to the comics(let's give them that),but I think Raimi's idea of giving Peter organic web shooters was a real improvement.Like I said above, in this new film they did EVERYTHING differently.The scene when Peter tests the web shooters is far from realistic as he chose to fall off a skyscraper in order to do that!.One of my first thoughts was how many times had the director(Webb)taken me to Peter's school and Oscorp.Most of the film's scenes take place either at school or Oscorp.I find this unacceptable unless this is a television series or something. Furthermore,Webb never seemed to understand what is important or not in this film and I believe his whole approach to this project was false.Few examples:Peter Parker being a skateboarder (!) while a genius geek at the same time.There are more than enough scenes after Parker was bitten by the spider where his hands glue. Spider sense was not portrayed properly.I could literally go on forever.To conclude, there is no stigma,style,interesting shots, there is nothing.I don't know where this guy Webb came from and I haven't seen his other movie, but he did an amateur job.Take out the CGI and production money and you have yourself a fan-made film.Christopher Nolan did another take on Batman but you can see he can direct,and his movies are really ""heavy"",meaning important and professional.I fear for what's coming next for the Spiderman franchise.It is certain that I will avoid seeing the future amazing Spiderman films.The biggest problem is that they do no honor to Spiderman and tend to destroy him before the eyes of us fans.","

Emma Stone was also good and they have good on screen chemistry.I usually don't like 3-D too much but this was way cool, especially the scenes where he flies through the air using his webbing.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","HunterGarza65","4 December 2012","This is the best Spider-Man yet.This Spider-Man film was the closes to the comics.The characters were really close to the comics.Why?Andrew did better in both Peter and Spider-Man.Proof!Andrew did better as Peter: Andrew's Peter looked more to the comics and plus he created that ""cuotion"" that turned Connors into Lizard.He﻿ also created the Web- Shooters meaning he used his brain to create them.Andrew created the silk trap which was his idea as a design of a trap and hey it's sorta smart.Andrew found out that problem in ""Oscorp"" that got the 3 legged mice to grow back their feet even though it was nerdy as well.My point is Andrew did better.Andrew did better as Spider-Man: He has Web-Shooters.Spider-Man actually messed around in the movie like he's supposed to and Spider-Man was also way more agile and powerful on this one.This is proof since in the movie Peter Parker found out that Dr.Connors(The Lizard),was going to turn everyone into over-mutated- lizards,so Peter put on his Spider-Man suit and went to swing into action.Yet,he got shot but re-fought and it let into him swinging in the scene ""The Crane Swing"" where Spider-Man shows his great agility in swinging.Results: Real Spider-Man fans look at small details which leads to The Amazing Spider-Man being better but only the characters and acting were completed right in Amazing Spider-Man and also the beginning,but The Spider-Man also did awesome in plot,so I don't think one goes to choose but appreciate what was done.Other:In my personal opinion,Amazing Spider-Man had the characters cast perfectly and the story started of the way it's supposed to.If you are a huge Spider-Man fan.Watch this great movie now.I also like The Amazing Spider-Man suit better.This movie deserves 10.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(10/10)","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","cthirlby","12 December 2021","This movie is both gritty, fun and emotional.Uncle Ben in the film was great and matches the energy as the original as he is so lovable and it's heartbreaking to watch him die and Peter listening to his voice message. The Lizard was an interesting villain he felt like both Doc Ock and Green Goblin as he went insane and thought he turned himself into a monster by the end. Gwen Stacy is the best Spider-Man live action love interest so far, she is played by an amazing actress and she isn't just Peters girl in this movie she actually does stuff and is a perfect match for Peter as she has a love for science. The swinging scenes by far are the best out of all the films as they are very cinematic and the film has some amazing shots too. Whilst it isn't as deep as the originals it brings something new to the table and just has fun with it. The movie is gritty and Peter is like a ""rebel teen"" of sorts and so it's a different version of Spider-Man that's cool to see and makes the character more gritty and emotional in that way. This is my second favourite live action Spider-Man actor not only cause I love this movie but Andrew loves the character so much.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","namashi_1","29 June 2012","'The Amazing Spider Man' lacks the excitement in comparison to the legendary the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. But if you look at it as a new story all together, it offers some interesting moments. But, for me, this film works primarily for one reason: Andrew Garfield's Winning Performance as Peter Parker / Spider-Man! 'The Amazing Spider-Man' Synopsis: Peter Parker finds a clue that might help him understand why his parents disappeared when he was young. His path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner.'The Amazing Spider Man' is fabulously shot & grandly made. But, I personally felt, that, the Screenplay wasn't up-to the mark. To give its due rightfully, there are some very interesting sequences & the action set-pieces are excellent, but overall, the desired impact, seems a bit missing. Screenplay by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent & Steve Kloves has merits, but it could've been stronger nonetheless. Marc Webb's Direction is stylish. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is vast. Graphics are outstanding. Action set-pieces, as mentioned, are excellent.Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield is up for top honors. The actor is fantastic as Peter Parker / Spider-Man! Its a performance that deserves immense praise. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, does a good job. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard, plays the menace easily. Martin Sheen as Ben Parker & Sally Field as May Parker are impressive, as always. Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy, is in command after a long time. Irrfan Khan as Dr. Rajit Ratha, deserved more footage. On the whole, 'The Amazing Spider Man' isn't Amazing, but stunning to look at nevertheless.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","sule-aniket","30 June 2012","It has been 24 hrs (app.) since i have seen the movie and i am still desperately trying to understand what was the target market in the mind of the director ? The movie was too complicated for children and was strange for adults like me.Despite of Emma stone and Sally field being totally wasted in their respective roles. I still thought that Andrew garfield would do a good job in the movie or at least justice to the spider-man character but he too seemed lost in the school (He is only 28years old) Why did peter and gwen need to go to a school school which occupies half of Manhattan ? as if that is possible in NY.Dr. Connors seemed deranged more than seeming like a genius. when you see a Marvel movie you expect the villain to display a lot of shades of grey and here we had an antagonist who seemed to be obsessed with improving mankind of all its weakness.our dear Dr. Norman Osborn seemed to be dying in the movie (God save the green goblin, what are we going to do in the sequel if the green goblin is not saved !!!) Irfan khan was visiting from the sets of MIB4 or maybe 5 he seems better suited there and not as a scientist dressed in all black.Peter's parents have a small side track which is left unexplained that it leaves viewers perplexed as to why did we just waste 20 minutes talking about them !!! A dying police chief applauds spider-man for his service to NY and tells him that he is meant for great things but also makes him promise to stay away from his daughter. The man just gave his life for the country but seems to be an overprotective father.I had gone in thinking that i would see a movie as amazing as The Avengers but clearly i was disappointed. Sam Raimi was better and we want him back.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","leplatypus","10 July 2012","The key to spidey is that's a super hero for kid. Raimi had understood this and his movies were indeed great. Here, it's not more the case and our friendly neighborhood becomes a silly costumed crusader. I really don't understand why the production wanted a such aggressive spiderman: Discovreing his power, peter punches commuters in the subway. His drive to be spidey is to punch endlessly thugs to see their wrists! Finally, when he does Spidey, it's only at night except for a fight in his high school or in an intelligent mirror effect for his 1st appearance. As peter, he shouts to his uncle, his aunt and the father of his girlfriend! His casting reminds me of Christensen in star wars prequels because this Garfield has the same darkside about him.The rest is also pathetic: The Mays are horrible as well in characters or in casting. Lizard might be okay but his ties with Peter is unbelievable. The Stacys are OK but killing Captain is useless: what's the point to develop a character and a tension if it's not meant to last. And if Emma Stone is a good surprise here, it's just because Dunst was always boring and uninspired. To resume, the first hour dragged horribly, the second makes you angry and it's only the final moment that you will find a decent Spidey but it's not enough and too late. Frankly, the only amazing thing in this movie may be Spidey's web because it's true that the new effects is bluffing.In other words, with Raimi and Maguire movies, i was eager to buy the DVD while i won't even bother to download this one on the web!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","krissaddy","3 July 2012","I had the opportunity of watching this movie on the second day of its release on this Saturday. Nearly 4 days before the actual US release.Firstly lets leave the whole, ""Oh! its a reboot and not a sequel"" thing outside the door. Its something the industrial analysts must be bothered about. As an audience it does not matter to me. I just want a movie to be entertaining and this movie is really better than the first Spiderman movie. This movie is getting unfair treatment as its a reboot. This movie should be judged by its own merit and not by comparisons. I consider myself blessed and entertained.... This may not be one of the jump-the-gun fast paced superhero flicks, it takes it time to establish the characters. Even the character development is done is a beautiful and entertaining way. I though this was much needed as people were already used to Spider man story and the mentality needed to change and realize that ""Its not the same deal anymore"". That was necessary and it was done perfectly. If you have seen 500 Days of Summer, you know that Marc Webb is good at directing romantic scenes, he has used this skill to his advantage and he has done a great job of showing the romance between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker... When it comes to performances, Andrew Garfield gets full points for being the best spider man in town... Not only does he look like spider man from the comics, his character was bratty and more vibrant than the ""Toby Maguire spidy"" which I really liked. Andrew is a good actor. I have always liked him since I first saw Boy A, thankfully he didn't fade into the void, Emma Watson playing Gwen Stacy the love interest of Spiderman really hit the bulls-eye. She looks gorgeous and lovable and she fits the role like a glove. The chemistry between the two is one of the high points of the movie... They look amazing together. Its a pity that Uncle Ben had to die in this movie, Martin Sheen fit the bill. The others did their job well. Its a better acted movie than all the first three Spidy movies. The second half of the movie is action packed with some tangible human spirit imbibed into it. There is one particular scene towards the end when Spidy is gravely hurt and the whole city comes to his rescue. It reminded me of brilliant ""train scene"" in Spider man 2, which is also my top spidy moment ever. Lizard as the villain was not as menacing as the previous bad guys in the Spider man Series, but a lot of the story is open for continuity and more villains are sure to follow. Also Lizard was not actually supposed to be menacing as he is still a good man gone bad due to a lab experiment gone wrong. Finally I would have to point out that this movie is made in 3D and they took advantage of our Superhero's maneuverability to a great extent. Some of the first person shots are breathtaking and feels like you are there with Spidy all the way. I would say this is my second favorite Spider man Movie after Spider Man 2. Its a slow movie no doubt but establishes the characters properly once it gets going it gets more entertaining. I am more than sure that the sequel will ""Go for it!"" from the start. A must watch movie for all Spider man fans. Truly ""Amazing""! Marc Webb Good job!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","sanddragon939","29 June 2012","A decade ago, Tobey Maguire brought everyone's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man to the big screen in Sam Raimi's blockbuster film, that spawned two sequels and won a legion of loyal fans across the globe...including me! For it was Raimi's 'Spider-Man' that first introduced me to Peter Parker and his world, and for that I will always be grateful to the film...but, there's simply no denying the fact that Marc Webb's 'The Amazing Spider-Man' has FAR surpassed the webhead's original cinematic incarnation!I think the best comparison one can offer for this film is Christopher Nolan's now-legendary Batman reboot, 'Batman Begins'. Much like how 'Begins' reinvented the Dark Knight for a new generation by focusing on a more grounded, character-driven arc for Bruce Wayne...'Amazing Spider- Man' does the same for Peter Parker. This is a Spider-Man one almost feels CAN exist in the real world...a Peter Parker who, while technically still a 'nerd', is no milksop and far from a goody-two- shoes.Andrew Garfield unquestionably deserves the bulk of the credit for the success of this film. He highlights the duality of Peter Parker and Spider-Man as Maguire never did-'Spider-Man' is not just Peter in a mask...Spider-Man is Peter freed from all the restraints of his identity, all the consequences of his actions. The mask of Spider-Man, to Peter, represents the anonymity similarly offered by Internet chat- rooms and forums; a point Garfield has raised in interviews, and which is is reflected throughout the film. His Peter doesn't become a superhero overnight...rather, his is a journey that encompasses the whole narrative of the film until, by the end, we finally see him become the heroic legend we all know and love. Perhaps the most striking difference, at least on a superficial level, between Garfield's Spider- Man and his predecessor, is the fact that this is a Spidey who's liberal with the wise-cracks. He is a hormonal, sometimes annoying, 17 year old and he sure acts like one!Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans deliver solid performances as Gwen Stacy and Dr. Curt Connors respectively. Stone's Gwen Stacy is certainly superior to Kirsten Dundt's Mary Jane Watson from the previous series-she's not just a love interest, but an integral part of the plot, along with her father, Captain George Stacy (Dennis Leary). Ifans plays Connors as a well-intentioned visionary gone astray, literally, as the reptilian monster known as the 'Lizard'...a powerful performance that easily rivals those of William Dafoe as Green Goblin or Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus from the old series.Beyond the excellent portrayals though, the movie's true strength is derived from an excellent script and some brilliant direction on the part of Marc Webb. While quiet a few liberties have been taken with the source material, Webb manages to stay pretty close to the spirit of Stan Lee's original story. The 'Ultimate Spider-Man' series has also clearly been a major influence, both stylistically and conceptually. While the film is a complete story in itself, there are a few plot threads left hanging...mysteries waiting to be resolved in the inevitable future installments. For now though, Spidey fans all over the world can enjoy this wonderful love-letter to Stan Lee and Steve Dikto's 50 year old creation!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","escalad89","1 November 2012","This movie in my personal opinion was the best Spiderman film of the 4! This movie came the closest to the comic that any of the other three!!! This movie developed the relationship between Gwen and Peter and sadly left Mary Jane out of it!This movie was funnier better written and better actors than the first 3! Why they choose The Lizard for the villain is beyond me! That was the worst park of the movie!The nest logical choice for the villain is: The Jackel, obsessed with Gwen, for the 2nd film. The Green Goblin, throws Gwen off a bridge, for the 3rd film. That way the can develop the romance between Mary Jane and Peter Parker in the 4th film, if this film franchise reaches that far.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","samuellop10","27 July 2012","First, the thing that most impressed me about The Amazing Spider-man was its storytelling. If you think about it, it is actually pretty simple, but I thought that it was very effective nonetheless. The characters and sequence of events including the action sequences as well as emotional ones were what made up most of it. Second, the characters had more than enough depth and most of them were not your typical stereotypes. Andrew Garfield made for one interesting Peter Parker/Spider-man. He was great at bringing him out. He made for one weird Spider-man which was something refreshing. Awkward all around, yet decisive, agile, and funny. Unknowingly helping the villain, then obtaining his powers, and a little time later trying to stop him; all the while experiencing and dealing with human emotions. From the comments I have read, this is the Spider-man from the comic books. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was refreshing to see as well. I liked that this time around the love interest got more involved in helping the hero stop the villain. It made the story more layered and interesting. She was appealing and charming. The chemistry between them, by the way, was great. Probably the best chemistry I have seen between a hero and his love interest. Dr. Connors made for a great villain. Evil, but at the same time being able to show and keep his human side. The rest of the actors, Denis Leary as Captain Stacy, Sally Field as aunt May, and Martin Sheen as uncle Ben did awesome jobs as well. Even though they did not get as much screen time, they were great supporting actors who made the film more interesting and entertaining. Third, if you were expecting for the film to surpass the previous one, you will most-likely, at least, be satisfied. Like 99.9% most-likely. The Spider-man character was different, but without a doubt better. The love interest, Gwen Stacy this time, was definitely better also. In one phrase, she totally kicks MJ's butt, at least in the movies. I would not know about it in the comic books. The villain, Dr. Connors a.k.a. The Lizard, did not surpass the Green Goblin in his evilness, but it made for a more complicated and exciting plot and challenge for Spider-man. Other things like the visuals, directing, and special effects, especially thanks to the 3D, were better as well this time around. Story-wise, this time it was more complicated and layered, but executed with simplicity, which only helped the film in making it more engaging and entertaining. So years ago when Peter Parker was only a child, his parents went away and left him in the care of his aunt May and uncle Ben. A briefcase which Peter's dad left behind is discovered. It includes sensitive information about a biological project involving splicing reptile DNA and its properties with human one, which works to regenerate the human body; Dr. Connors is mentioned within it. Later Peter discovers that Gwen is working with Dr. Connors in his lab, and he also finds out that Dr. Connors is still trying to solve part of the project to finalize it. Then Peter sees that the solution is among the papers in the briefcase, and he shares the solution with Dr. Connors. Unfortunately Dr. Connors uses it on himself without enough research and trails, bringing side effects to himself such as super-strength, physical deformation, and a distorted state of mind. It is a temporal thing, working only as long as the regenerative effects last, but, after experiencing the strength and its power, he can not let it go, and convinces himself that this this is the perfect state for humans. So he starts this by trying to make all of the city like him. After Peter sees him and what he is capable of, he takes responsibility of it, thinking that he should because he helped to solve the project, and thus helped turn Dr. Connors into The Lizard. During the same time Gwen and Peter become closer, more than just friends. And she also becomes closely involved in trying to stop The Lizard from transforming all of the city. While this is happening Peter has also to deal trying to hide his secret from his aunt and uncle, and escaping from the police who have branded him a criminal, especially Gwen's dad, Captain Stacy. The film seemed a little slow at times, and when it was done it felt like a short movie, which is totally inaccurate as the film runs a little over two hours. For me this just means that the film was so good it kept me engaged all throughout it, so I did not think about the time. If you analyze it, It might not be the most packed and intense action superhero movie out there, however, not having the most intense in those things does not necessarily make it boring or bad. When there is no action to make it intense, the film is still very entertaining and interesting. Plus, for me characters and story lines are more important. The reason is that when there is no intense action on screen is when the story and characters develop. So when the action does happen it is made more intense not because it is actually intense, but because you are more engrossed in the story and because you care more about the characters due to those times in the film when there is no action. And this is exactly what The Amazing Spider- man does.","

However, as time went on, the film was viewed and the impression became better. Much better, which left fans in two camps: those who embraced the change, the freshness of the franchise, and those who never strayed from Sam Raimi's cinematic Spider-Man canon.But only one thing can be said with certainty: the magical chemistry of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, Spiderman, which really corresponds to the canons - this gives the films a well-deserved positive assessment.","

The inclusion of Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard was long overdue and was played adequately by Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen and Sally Field were great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May as was Dennis Leary's Captain Stacy.In short, a solid cast, great story and wonderful effects inject new blood into an already great blockbuster franchise.","

I just couldn't get past the casting. Andrew Garfield looks every bit of 30 in this role. I know we have to suspend logic to get into the fantasy, but come on, give us a little help, yeah? There really wasn't anything memorable or outstanding about this film. It's just something to do when you're really bored, I think.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","RatchetJak94","13 July 2012","Spider-Man is my favorite super-hero of all time. I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).I enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.I don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.Let's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a ""Jekyll and Hyde""-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.The visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.The musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.If I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","legioner8800","4 July 2012","Probably it's because I've seen the Tobey-Man and this is the reason I give this movie such a low score. I wanted to learn more about Peter's parents, but did not. ""They were scientists."" So what? That's not even 5% of what I needed to find out. Tobey-Man was on par with emotions, stunts and discovering the character. Here your uncle dies and what you see is 2 mins of drama about him. They really did not expand the characters and that led to my disappointment. This really isn't the spider-man I wanted to see (full of questioning, thoughts and hardship). This guy was crying one minute and kissing the girl in another. Did I even mention that the suit did not fully fit him? Did I mention that Peter became a super scientists in 5 mins after he start reading 2 books and a couple of documents that do not make sense? Since when kids study genetics in school so deeply? Tobey-Man's story deeper and more interesting. You could see the bright side of having super powers and the dark of constantly having the responsibility to hide your identity and take care of the closest. The new Spidey did little effort to hide his id. I could actually say that he was waving his mask the entire movie...If you were happy with Tobey-man, stick with him!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","kxsinc","17 December 2021","So when I watched this movie for the first time (way after it had come out), I was under the impression that it was a pretty forgettable movie by the Marvel fandom and I just needed to watch it so I could understand what would happen in No Way Home. So I have it watch.Honestly, it was better than what I thought it was, but definitely one of the weaker Spider-Man movies. There are things that don't work in this movie - personally, Peter Parker as a skate kid didn't do it for me, a couple unsolved plots, and Uncle Ben (where was the famous line??) but there were good things tooThe action and design of this movie was phenomenal. The swinging action is still the only movie that fully captures the agility of Spider-Man (the newer MCU ones don't really have these action shots) and the fight scenes are so cleverly made. Andrew Garfield got the Spider-Man half right - he captured the clever and witty personality of Spider-Man better than Maguire did. The second thing, really what stood out about this movie is the chemistry between Gwen and Parker. Something about their relationship connected and really made me think they were destined to be together. It's better than any other marvel ship that comes to my mind and thus just made the ending so satisfying for me.","

For me the best thing of this movie is the love between Gwen and Peter, Marc Webb does that perfectly, I think the storyline is good too, the first act was a good origin, don't get me wrong, it just dont have the sparkle the first one had, I love the homemade suit of this movie. My favorite thing of the movie was the end, the death of Gwen's father broke me, he saying to Peter to not put Gwen into this, the funeral. I love the mensage of this movie, not everything can be the way we want, this movie is almost perfect, and it's not even close to be bad.","

I never did like the earlier Spiderman movies, being the main role or the supporting ones, I'm not sure; but they still stand among the movies I'm not eager to watch again. But this one, on the contrary, was actually quite entertaining. Not was it only packed with really great CGI, but it had a great flow built up on both action, drama, romance and humor.At least for me this is what makes a good movie. I never once thought ""Oh, my goodness that was lame"" (which I often actually do), instead I was rather surprised I was laughing out loud in more than one of the scenes.All the actors did a MARVELous job, meaning all the jokes, the depth of the drama, and the sincerity of both the romance and the action stood solid throughout the movie. Speaking of the actors: the casting was brilliant. All of the main actors (and I guess most of the supporting ones) was perfect for their roles, and must have made the script it self proud.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","camcrafton","15 December 2012","""Spoiler Warning Just to be Safe!!!"" I liked the original three Spiderman films as much as anybody, if not more, but I really feel like they did an amazing job with this reboot. I may be in the minority, but I feel like this film did a great job at handling Peter's change from nerd to hero. Every character in this film felt human, and every actor did a fantastic job with their respective characters. A lot people keep comparing this to the original three films, and even more are saying that they should of just made a fourth film instead of reboot...I disagree. This film didn't reinvent the story, nor did it switch it up much but what it did do was make the characters more relatable and made this A lot closer to the comics, although it still isn't exactly like the comics. One of my main gripes about the original Spiderman film was a petty one, I'll admit that, but it got addressed and was fixed in this one. That would be the fact the Parker actually has to make his web shooters in this one whereas in the original the spider bite gave him his power to shoot webs. Now for the villain...while The Lizard obviously has nothing on The Green Goblin, I feel like he was a great choice for the film. While, yes Goblin is iconic, I feel that he should be the main focus in the movie he appears and not given a side role for over half the movie which they would of had to do in an origin story such as this one. A lot of people were upset about the CGI limiting The Lizar's movement,and I can honestly say it didn't bother me one bit. In fact I would prefer the CGI over some guy running around in a lizard costume...that wouldn't be very menacing now would it? In conclusion, I feel like this reboot was justified and in my humble and honest opinion proved to be BETTER than any of the original three Spiderman films, except for possibly the second one... Cannot wait for TSM2 to come out!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","supernatural136-112-438827","5 July 2012","I loved this movie. I know most of the reviews you're going to see will rebuke it just for being a reboot, no the original, but I have to say that I actually liked The Amazing Spiderman much better than the original. First with the cast. I love, love, loved Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker. As a regular high school nerd talking with his crush, he managed to make the audience awkward for him, and thats something never explored by the first Spiderman. Overall, this movie was a much more accurate portrayal of what would happen if a teenage boy suddenly became a superhero. Emma Stone also impressed everyone as Spidey's new love interest Gwen Stacy, and she's a very much welcome replacement of Mary Jane Watson. The entire trilogy of Spiderman, and I think all Mary Jane did was scream and put on her best ""ahhhh, I'm captured"" face. Gwen Stacy is half the reason Spiderman triumphs in this movie, and wasn't once used as bait. Secondly, the special effects. There's these two scenes, made even more amazing by the 3D, where the audience is actually seeing through Spiderman's eyes as he flies over the city. It's absolutely breathtaking. Most of the web-slinging scenes are beautifully made, but the other reviews are right when they say the action is not what it could have been. the Amazing Spiderman focused more on the characters than the original. It's more about why they do what they do and how they feel about it, not just about how they beat the bad guy. In summary, I loved the reboot of the Spiderman franchise and can't wait for the next one. I give it a nine out of ten.","

Purists will find holes in some of the explanations of the character and his abilities if they compare it to the other movies, but better to take this movie on it's own merits rather than comparisons.I found the acting was very good from all the players and the filming had a very classy feel to it, the effects were enjoyable and not over the top. Above all there was a good sprinkling of humour from the character punctuated with good timing throughout the movie.Andrew Garfield played the part very well and surprised me with his clear acting abilities,Denis Leary is as good as always.It felt like money well spent picking this one up!","

My 9 year old also came out thinking this is the best spider-man film yet, trumping the Sam Raimi ones, which while excellent didn't have the same amount of 'soul' for me. My best friend and his wife didn't want to watch this due to the negativity surrounding it, which is a real shame as I think they have missed out on a real gem. A 9 from me, the average of mine and my son's rating. :)P.S. I watched this in 2D as I find the vast majority of 3D films get in the way of the movie experience, Hugo being the notable exception.","

It goes in great depth of how Peter Parker turns into SPIDERMAN. I mean it wasn't fake looking, like the high school looked as if it were real because in some movies you say that is nothing like how high school is like but it was portrayed very well. Then when he was making his web shooters you just saw all these blue prints and you saw him make. You can tell that this SPIDERMAN is closer to the one in the comics. Although the suit wasn't the same you can role with it. But the plot was well written and for once the girl friend was never kept hostage. The acting was really good Andrew Garfield is (29 or 30) Emma Stone is (24 or 25) in real life in there acting made you believe they were actually 17. There's a lot of kissing scenes but you know what who cares that is what makes you believe there young. The LIZARD was well done and everything made you think that this really could happen (cross genetics.) Screw the critics this is an awesome movie and if your a Spidey fan you will love it. P.S. They have really good songs chose too.","

Andrew Garfield makes a better peter parker/spider man in my opinion he looked the part, had the right personality and acted it out perfectly where as Tobey Maguire I thought was too geeky and shy with not much personality.unlike the original this movie stays completely true to the comic, his first love is Gwen Stacy played by the amazing Emma stone who is fantastic as always but in the original they had Mary Jane which is wrong because peter didn't meet Mary Jane until after, when peter starts turning into spider man he makes a web shooter out of cartridges but the original just had it coming out his wrists and the villain was the same in the comic being the lizard played by Rhys Ifans who did a fantastic job he played both personalities of good and bad superbly compared to the ridiculous green goblin who was just awful. all the CGI and effects in this movie are faultless and top notch, they took total advantage of all the technology we have in this day and age and the whole movie was so well made and looked stunning, the design of spider mans costume was great, the camera work on the swinging through the city shots were superb and the lizard was scarily life like the whole entire movie makes the original look lame and outdated completely.in conclusion only bother with the amazing spider man not the originals and look forward to the sequel in 2014.","

Andrew Garfield is the perfect choice for Spiderman. Now don't get me wrong, Tobey Maguire was a good Spiderman, but there was several things wrong with him. 1. Was his size. He was just too buff to be Spiderman. I know this is a stupid reason, but it's a reason none the less. 2. His tone was too monotone at most points. Those are just a few. Garfield embodied all that was needed to be Spiderman. Now, as everyone should have been able to tell, the cast had incredible chemistry with each other. Not saying the cast of Raimi's trilogy didn't have chemistry with each other, but the cast in this movie just worked and flowed with each other. That is one of the key things in making a movie.","

After the release of NWH, I decided to take an adventure to this universe. Come to find out, I don't agree with any hate for these movies. The writing, although scratchy in some places, is fixed by the skilled performance of Andrew Garfield. Tom Holland comes across as a team player, Toby, although spectacular, doesn't quite match the teenage notion of how spiderman is portrayed. Garfield has a much more childish view of life, and consequences of his decisions. His Peter Parker is moody, as a normal teen is. His spiderman is carefree, but he learns from his mistakes. This is why I believe he is the best spiderman that has ever existed. Although most don't, I'm routing for you Andrew. You are amazing.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","ford_guy20042000","3 July 2012","There is no comparison really.This movie when compared to the previous Spiderman movies far outshines the old Tobey Maquire movies.Where to begin.The acting...they used real actors. When Spidey gets the crap kicked out of him, you feel it. You see blood, you see wounds and bruises. Not the kind that Tobey got where 2 seconds later he was all better. It felt more real. Andrew Garfield is a Superior actor over Tobey. Sally Field, Martin Sheen, and Emma Stone completely surpassed their previous incarnations, however I felt that the Aunt May character and Gwen Stacy character were a bit underused.The truly wonderful thing about the movie is, the lame humor of the past is gone. There isn't a Russian landlord chasing Peter for rent. And Peter doesn't feel like a whiny, little girl like Tobey portrayed him. For instance in those movies, in all three he screamed like a girl when hit.The story was solid, but not strong. They had it in the right direction, but I think they needed to build on a few things. I didn't buy the main plot of the Lizard. OK..whatever but I was thinking...really? The story was still good enough to be called good and by far the best of the Spidey movies.Fight scenes, Spidey web slinging through the air, and the CGI all great. No complaints there.The chemistry between Peter and Gwen, they have what Tobey and Kirsten Dunst did not have. They need to seriously expand on that in the next movie. The man is what drives the hero. They need to get the balance right, and they need to develop his relationships a bit more.One of my main gripes of the old movies was that in every one of them the other characters insisted on calling Peter by both his first and last name, all the time. Peter Parker this and Peter Parker that. It was ridiculous and nobody talks like that. Sadly they did carry that into this movie as well. Although without quite the hokiness of the others.They need to keep a sense of realism. Don't get silly with it. Make dreams come true and not just transfer the dream to screen. I want to believe that its possible that a man with spider powers can fight a giant lizard man on a tall skyscraper. Which they did pretty well in this one.It is absolutely and completely worth your time to go see.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","DICK STEEL","29 June 2012","I would never have thought Garfield as the right person for the job. But I'm glad that he had proved me wrong, just as how Marc Webb had unequivocally stated that we haven't seen nothing yet with what Garfield can do with the role. He morphed into Peter Parker the shy lad, like hand in glove, and then transformed into the heroic Spider-Man sans mask, straddling and struggling with his dual identities just as how any scrawny teenager would if to be blessed (or cursed) with new found abilities, highlighting awkwardness and the building of confidence to perfection. Webb knew exactly what he was looking for in a leading man and allowed plenty of emotional engagement and attachment to Garfield's Peter, with Garfield proving him right, and now carries the superhero mantle with aplomb, nailing it as an unlikely hero.Then there's Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, equally important as the romantic fodder for Peter Parker, and this update had given us a leading lady character who has beauty and brains combined, together with a degree of spunk that Mary Jane Watson in the previous three films had lacked, with the latter falling prey in each and every installment that it was getting pretty tired. Stone has proved to carry an entire film on her own, and here shares incredible chemistry opposite Garfield to make them that cute couple in school who have to battle the pangs of first love, and not only having to deal with that strong emotion, but loss as well. While that Maguire-Dunst upside down tongue gymnastics is something hard to beat, Garfield-Stone do have their little romantic stunt that adds a degree of fun that each of Raimi's version lacked. Which is a good thing especially when trying to sway over the nay- sayers.I suppose almost everyone out there will know what to expect already from an origin movie, and James Vanderbilt's story kicks off into high gear from the get go, weaving and setting a new stage and universe in which this version of Spider-Man will thrive under, with Oscorp being that scientific conglomerate headed by an unseen, but constantly mentioned Norman Osborn, and having the mythos deeply involving the corporation, opening doors to possibilities that any subsequent film can cover, especially with that end credits scene. It also picked up from the Batman Begins template in a number of areas, but I'm not complaining because it's all good to successfully reboot the franchise, adapting elements from its comic book source which serve as canon, but giving it a different angle that maintains the spirit of things and events, even key ones like Uncle Ben's demise that truly shaped the destiny of the wall-crawler.As always with the Spider-Man mythos, Peter Parker deals more with loss, and loses more than he's won, and having that retained in the film made it venture down a darker road, and being more vulnerable. And going back to basics never hurt, with one single villain in Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) as the Lizard, even if an army of Lizards were hinted at from merchandise, and keeping/hinting at others who may appear in subsequent movies. The villain-hero set up was reminiscent of the second Raimi film with Peter Parker and Dr Octopus sharing a connection before the latter went bonkers, and provided yet again another battle on the emotional front. The Lizard may be lesser known, but is a powerful foe that audiences may have already been primed for from Raimi's films if they were to do a little research on the recurring Connors character then.Action wise, Webb had gotten excellent material from the comics and clearly dipped into them for inspiration, with Spidey's iconic poses and movement all making it into the film, coming off as poetry in motion. This was something that the earlier Spider-Man films had paled in comparison, with action sequences all being more kinetic in treatment, utilizing a whole slew of Spider-abilities. And the mechanical web shooters weren't all that bad, since again it went back to basics to showcase Parker's intellect, if only for a short while during a montage as does showing off his sewing skills. Webbing plays a big role in being the arsenal of choice, and the variation shown in this film is staggering, with the previous films never even coming close to how this Spider-Man excelled in fighting with them. And with those webshooters, you'll be itching for moments when the web fluid would run out, or to have something happen to them like how the Stan Lee (probably the best cameo appearances of all Marvel films here) devised in his stories, just to provide additional challenge.Marc Webb had shown not only Sam Raimi can make a good Spider-Man summer blockbuster, and I'm pretty sure Webb's version can stand up to and probably excel from the predecessors.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","davidisgoliath38","30 March 2014","Toby Magure was never believable as Spiderman, I mean Stan Lee's Spiderman. He wasn't enough of a smart ass. He was hard to take seriously, he lacked the ability to make his character believable, because maybe he thought the whole superhero/spiderman thing was corny. Andrew Garfield grew up reading the comics, and that comes through. This is not just a rehashing, it's treating Stan Lee's characters and story with the respect they deserve. People really thought Spiderman 3 did Gwen Stacy justice? In Stan Lee's Spiderman Gwen Stacy is his first love, and she's a sweet girl (pretty much what the first three films did with Mary Jane). In the comics Mary Jane is a fiery redhead who's not anything like the Mary Jane in the first 3 spiderman movies. In fact it would make sense for MaryJane not to appear at all in the first 2 or 3 movies. This movie really does a great job of playing out these characters the way they should be played out. I wasn't a fan of the darker look from the trailers but I got over it. Spiderman isn't the avengers, and if you think about all of the arcs in the Spiderman comics you realize that his life is just filled with tragic irony and bittersweet moments. For that reason the dark direction actually makes sense. People saying this isn't as good as the first 3, maybe you haven't watched them in a while. I remember being blown away by Spiderman and Spiderman 2 as a kid. But comic movies have gotten a lot better since then. You've had incredible ones like the Dark Knight and Iron Man and the Avengers. The first three Spiderman movies are over the top with the cheesiness to a degree that should make real Spiderman fans cringe. They made green goblin just the first villain instead of the mastermind behind the rising if other villains. You shouldn't fight the big boss in the first level. Gwen Stacy was an afterthought in the third movie, when Stan Lee has said that Gwen Stacy was supposed to be Spider-man's true love. To sum it up, Amazing Spiderman is a LOT better than those terrible first 3 films, and people who aren't able to see that are blinded by nostalgia.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","notstone","8 August 2012","I'll keep it simple. I loved this movie. Spiderman has been my favorite super hero since around 1983 when I got my first Spiderman action figure. This is the Spiderman movie I have been waiting for. Fine, it's a reboot, and everybody wants to compare it to the first series, but I don't care. I felt that the movie had just enough humor, cheese, drama and teenage angst and awkwardness. I liked that Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy actually had some chemistry. P.P. felt more believable as a teenager than in the first serious...and I dig that he made his own webbing rather than it just spitting out of his wrist. The spidey suit was way cooler in this flick than the first series. It didn't look CGI throughout the whole movie like the originals. It's actually a dude in a suit. When he takes out his cell phone to talk to whoever, that's pretty hilarious. It's got action, fun, adventure, a coming of age aspect, drama and cheese. It makes for a good film.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","alindsayal","23 December 2021","Next on my Spider-Man review series is the reboot The Amazing Spider-Man and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Peter Parker become Spider-Man and have to stop a new mentor from changing New York forever.Main Character
Andrew Garfield plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he is very good in his role. His Peter Parker is really different to Tobey Maguire's and it does seem like this interpretation of the character has been more modernised and it works pretty well. He is really great as Spider-Man, he nails the quips well and I think overall this is a different but effective showing by Garfield.Supporting Characters
Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy and she is really good, she is a fun love interest that doesn't ever annoy me. The chemistry is amazing on screen which is probably helped by some off screen chemistry, it really raises the quality of the film and it makes the whole romance angle of the film an actual joy to watch. Rhys Ifans plays Curt Connors/The Lizard and he is also decent, I have some complaints about the character but his performance is pretty strong and if given more attention this could have been a top villain instead of just a decent one. The late Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, Dennis Law and Sally Field are also all good in their roles and fit the world very well around the other three more prominent characters.Story
The story is good in terms of introducing us to a new Spider-Man and it does certain elements that are new and fresh in this world. I just wish it had leaned into these more focused instead of things that are quite generic or that we have seen before. This is a clear origin film and it just feels really rehashed, maybe something else could have been done to change it up or just have him be Spider-Man at the start of the film. Also Lizard's plan is just absurd and makes no sense, it feels underdeveloped and rushed just because the film needs a villain.Script
The script has some good one liners from Spider-Man, he feels funny and like you would imagine a young man as a new super hero would. But the drama is a bit of a mixed bag, the romance is good and I cared about it, but some of the other drama doesn't work. It feels like it isn't fleshed out enough and doesn't do enough to really make me care.Style
The film looks really good, Spider-Man's costume and swinging look fantastic and I really liked how it did the POV shots of him swinging as it felt like we were swinging with him in the rooftops of New York. But some of the action scenes didn't really hit with me and I wasn't a huge fan of Lizard's look in the film. The pacing isn't great either with the first act in particular dragging for me.Overall
Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man is a good film. If you are a fan of the character you will enjoy it but it could have maybe done a bit more to stand out.Rating - 7/10.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","lethelweapon","12 April 2013","I know people spidey fans will disagree with what I am about to say but i think that the original spider man trilogy is like avatar in the sense that they are good movies but are completely over rated. they don't have anything on other superhero films such as say The Dark Knight trilogy, The reason why I preferred the new one was because it was less corny and more satisfying than the originals. The only part I was disappointed with was the fact that peter parkers school bully became his friend at the end, because I was glad to see how they made peters bully was sorry for beating him up when it came to a life and death matter but when he became his friend it was taken to far and felt to corny. other than that it was defiantly worth seeing.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","MBunge","10 July 2012","To preface this review, I thought Sam Raimi's Spider-Man was a really entertaining film that managed to overcome some pretty big mistakes. Spider-Man II is one of the best super-hero movies ever. Spider-Man III was a mess that still had a few redeeming features. The Amazing Spider-Man? Well, it was fun with some really strong elements and there was nothing as garishly wrong with it as the Green Goblin's costume and Macy Gray's appearance in Spider-Man or Topher Grace's botched Venom in Spider-Man III. As someone who grew up reading the comics, I'll credit director Mark Webb with getting right a lot of the little things Raimi did not. But while I think this is ultimately a good flick and worth seeing, it's also one of the most fundamentally problematic movies I've ever watched.To start with, this is a retelling of Spider-Man's origin, something we saw only a decade previously with Raimi. As much as they change the details (and we'll get into that in a second) and give this story a very different tone, however, it's telling us stuff with which we're already quite familiar. A good chunk of this film, as nicely done as it is, has an unavoidably superfluous quality. At the more sluggish points of the plot, you can't help but feel like you'd rather be watching Spider-Man IV instead of a reboot of the first movie.Secondly, this thing largely butchers the classic Spider-Man origin. Paradoxically, I suspect most viewers won't mind that much because the more traditional (at least in that respect) Raimi take is fresh in their memories. But if this had been the first Spider-movie ever made, comic book fanboys would be lighting themselves on fire in protest. It's not even about them not saying ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". It's that Peter Parker's lesson in responsibility isn't something he learns from the death of his beloved Uncle Ben. It's something he learns during a dinner table conversation with some guy he's never met before. If that's how it had worked in Amazing Fantasy #15, I'm not sure things would have worked out quite so well for Marvel Comics.Thirdly, while the romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy clicks thanks to the chemistry of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, the relationship itself is kind of a poorly told joke. While Garfield and Stone are frequently great together on screen, the story underneath them is forced and manufactured. Whereas Raimi provided reasons for Peter and Mary Jane Watson to fall in love, this movie throws Peter and Gwen together because that's what the script says. It also helped that the character of Mary Jane had a life independent of Peter Parker in the first two films. Here, Gwen is Peter's inevitable girlfriend/plot device and not much else. And by the end, The Amazing Spider-Man has truly bollixed up the classic Peter/Gwen dynamic from the comics.Boy, it reads like I'm not much of a fan of this motion picture, doesn't it? The truth is, there's many things about it I like immensely. This is the best ever representation of the change in Peter's personality when he puts on the mask and is liberated of his self-imposed awkwardness and insecurity. Spider-Man is finally the wise-cracking motormouth from the comics. And while Tobey McGuire gave Peter Parker a nerdy, dweebish quality, Garfield actually makes him look and sound like a socially inept teenager. Emma Stone is just great and proves a talented comic actress can fill up a shallowly written role. The fight scenes may not be quite on par with the Doc Ock throwdowns from Spider-Man II, but they're damn sweet in their own right. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are also quite good as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, though they have to share the supporting spotlight with Denis Leary as Gwen's police captain father. Rhys Ifans does a fine job a Curt Connors and the mystery subplot of what happened to Peter's parents is well woven throughout the movie. And, of courseweb-shooters, baby!!Let me repeat, The Amazing Spider-Man is a good film and worth watching. It'll certainly get the bad taste out of your mouth from Spider-Man III. It also looks and sounds far more like Nolan's Batman movies than a piece of Marvel cinema, though it does continue the tradition of Spidey's mask coming off at every opportunity. But is it more than just another summer super-hero blockbuster? Not really.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","kaden_lewis","26 December 2021","Before watching Spider-Man No Way Home (2021), I decided to re watch all the previous Spider-Man movies. However, I wanted to review all the Spider-Man movies until after I saw No Way Home so I could get a true rating. Every single Spider-Man movie was amazing, but this one was actually me least favorite. Don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie, it was entertaining, the actors were great and the villain was cool, but it just didn't stick out for me. That is why I feel the others are better.The main thing I really liked about this movie was how it showed the larger backstory or Peter Parker. In the Tobey Maguire films, we were told Peter's parents died, and he had to live with his aunt and uncle. In this movie, we were shown a little bit of what happened to his parents. It also showed them dropping Peter off at uncle Ben and aunt May's house and leaving. I really liked this because it was very unique, interesting, and added a very important aspect of Peter's story that was skipped over in the Sam Raimi movies.Another thing I liked about this moved was the acting and the story. I thought Emma Stone played Gwen Stacy perfectly, and her chemistry with Andrew is unbelievable. Also, the story of this movie was also pretty cool. I liked how Gwen found out Peter was Spider-Man very quickly. I also liked the family aspect added with the Stacy family.As you can see from my review. I really liked this movie. But in my opinion, the other Spider-Man's are just better. Still, I definitely recommend watching this. It is very well done, and important (just like the other movies) if you are going to see No Way Home.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","torchwood949-166-552404","19 June 2012","In 2002 Sam Raimi created the first of his soon to be ""Spider-Man"" trilogy with ""Spider-Man"". Apart from ""X-Men' there hadn't really been a large superhero film since the classic ""Superman"" films from the late 70's, early 80's. 2004 came and Raimi built upon the solid foundations of his initial creation with a near perfect, smart film made for all audiences, even those who had no love for superhero films known as ""Spider-Man 2"". Years later he would go on to make ""Spider-Man 3"", a heavily flawed but still somewhat enjoyable experience. Now 5 years on from the last incarnation of the web slinger we are presented with director Marc Webb's (Who also directed the fantastic ""500 Days of Summer"") perception of the masked crusader in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"".Starting from the ground up we are re-introduced to Spider-Man with a central performance from Andrew Garfield playing Peter Parker, the high school student who receives extraordinary gifts reminiscent of a spider through a bite of a genetically engineered arachnid. Alongside having to understand his newfound powers he gains a love interest with fellow student Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) and discovering the mysterious disappearance of his parents as a child with the help of one-armed scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who worked alongside his dad. However Connors is trying to work on a cure for his arm through the DNA of lizards and ends up becoming a monstrosity known as The Lizard in the process. Now it's up to Spider-Man to prevent The Lizard from tearing apart the city.Marc Webb has taken up this huge task of re-booting the series and has managed to craft a solid piece of summer entertainment, but not without it's flaws. However on the positive side he creates a brilliantly paced blockbuster with the first hour building on the characters and the second hour bringing high-octane action in a constant rhythm without becoming stale. He also manages to capture the character of Spider-Man fantastically bringing the humorous one-liners that he quips from the comic books and adds it to his film without ever over doing it. Along side his great action, pacing and realization of Spider-Man it's backed with a thumping score which breaks into moments of greatness as it reaches different tones, a heavy standout being the horror track that backs a lot of The Lizard scenes. Along with some great direction from Webb showing one or two scenes of true horror making him an interesting choice from a film in that genre.Its not just Webb's directing that stands out, Garfield creates his own version of Spider-Man and not only captures it but embodies it. It's a role he was born to play and it's evident that he's enjoying every scene he's in playing this character, alongside playing Parker. Being a surprising addition to the cast is Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben who brings a more heartfelt and lovable interpretation to the role that the other films were never able to capture. Ifans is a great choice for Connors as well and dominates the scenes he's in with his strong presence being felt. It's just a shame this is lost when he becomes The Lizard and the CGI creation becomes a cheesy mess with no real threat or character as the computer generate scenes play out. The most disappointing of all however is the character of Gwen Stacey. As strong as Stones performance is the character is not. She feels more like a plot device at times than a genuine love interest for Spider-Man and since their relationship grows so fast it's hard to really grab anything from what you're being given.The biggest problem with the film however is the script, which Webb manages to keep on top, but not without it's flaws. At times it comes an inconsistent mess, for example in one scene Parker would touch an object which would suddenly stick to his hand and then the next scene he would be able to grab objects with ease, but then after this would go back to the prior problem. There's also some forced narrative choices as well, especially the scene in which Parker comes up with the idea for his suit which felt completely un-natural and a jolt out of the story. Alongside some forced plot ideas were certain plot strands that were left un- resolved, a main one involving Uncle Ben that reaches a crescendo and then never ties it's self up. The whole script feels unfinished and flips between a positive storytelling experience to a completely unpolished one.However despite these flaws Webb manages to keep the film afloat with some great characters, exciting action and an enjoyable time overall. Audiences should not soon forget though how great Sam Raimi captured Spider-Man in his direction though and the chemistry of the cast, each having their own story arcs. It'll be interesting to see where Webb takes his creation, as there's a lot here to like, just a weak script and some un-polished characters stop it from being the greatness it could have been. With films such as ""The Avengers"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" being the heavy weight superhero films to storm multiplexes it's hard to see ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" finding a heavy footing. But it's still worth checking out and will provide an entertaining two hours for audiences. There's still some web left in this spider after all.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","christhebodishot","4 July 2012","After the last film, I was hard pressed to think that this one could be worse. Well, sure enough it is.Warning, spoilers ahead.The reasons that this film isn't good are simple: Most of the action scenes, take place at night- and are visually uninteresting as the CGI and night sky don't make good bedfellows. There is one action scene at day in which you can actually see what's going on, and its in a high school that clearly isn't anywhere within a three mile radius of New York.We all understand how they shoot interiors in Culver City.. But the last spiderman films seamlessly blended shoots from Chicago, New York, Los Angeles without the audience ever noticing. This film does not, in fact the only attempt to make the high school look like New York is a lame sign.This film's story has been done before, you've seen it before and with the exception of the Osbournes and the color of the love interests hair, there is not much new to this story.Dennis Leary is great, as is Martin Sheen but they're both killed off. Martin Sheen is killed off in the beginning of this boring movie, making it more painful as he was one of the only reliefs.Aunt May is written so poorly, that she has nothing to do in this movie. She sits at home and watches TV and screams at Peter when she sees him. Not exactly a challenging role for the great Sally Field.There was little care that went into the quality of this film, and the attempts at making it dark are just flat out Corny such as the cannibal rat, which is pure comedy and comes out of nowhere to 'shock' the audience.There seems to be no conflict between Peter and his girlfriend at the end of the story, which one would logically want to assume that she holds out some contempt for spiderman as Harry did in the original spiderman after Spiderman played a hand in his death. Spiderman did play a hand in the Captain's death, yet the daughter doesn't seem to mind that Peter was there when he was murdered.This film had great visual effects, obscured by the night time setting and slow down camera techniques. Other than that, it's a music video and it pulls NO surprises. You have already seen this film if you've seen the extended trailer, or the 2002 Green Goblin movie.The chemistry between the two leads is lame, with Andrew Garfield who is wonderful in other films and stage productions giving a few moments of over-acting that take away Peter's humanity and spell the word HAM with it. Also, they appear to be improvising in some of their scenes, the result is two young, MEGA-RICH people trying to imagine what blue- collared kids from Queen's social customs would be like, and let me tell you they FAIL in a telling and Inauthentic way.This movie does not have you believe in the setting or characters at all. It is just ridiculous.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Wuchakk","7 July 2017","Released in 2012 and directed by Marc Webb, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" stars Andrew Garfield as geeky teen Peter Parker, who is bit by a radioactive spider and acquires spider-like powers. Emma Stone plays his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, while Denis Leary plays her father, the captain of the NYPD. Rhys Ifans plays the one-armed Dr. Curt Connors, who develops a dubious serum which morphs him into a human Lizard. Sally Field and Martin Sheen appear as Aunt May & Uncle Ben whereas Irrfan Khan is on hand as Connor's suspicious superior.While this is a solid Spider-Man film with an effective cast it can't hold a candle to the film it reboots, 2002's ""Spider-Man,"" which was still fresh in the mind in 2012 (and still is). Compare the Spider-Man costumes, for instance, particularly the masks; there's no contest. The story is basically the same except that (1.) Gwen Stacy is the girlfriend instead of Mary Jane, (2.) the Lizard is the villain instead of the Green Goblin, (3.) Spider-Man uses artificial web-shooters rather than intrinsic ones, and (4.) Captain Stacy basically replaces J. Jonah Jameson.The movie run 142 minutes and was shot in New York City and Los Angeles (or points nearby).GRADE: B","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","dilipbts","10 June 2020","Being a Spider-man comic book fan I can say that a lot of the stuff that happens in this story is true to the comic book Spider-man. Spider-man has web shooters, Spider-man likes to joke a lot, Gwen Stacy was Spider-man's first love, etc. So Anyone who is a fan of the comics will respect this movie on that merit, the merit that it was faithful to the source material while bringing in new stuff without losing what made Spider-man who he is.People who've only seen the Spider-man films and never bothered to read any of the comics. Won't like this film as much. They'll say the same old stuff. ""Why was this made? We've seen this already?"" Blah blah blah.Let me go off saying that behind Spider-man 2, this is probably the best of the Spider-man trilogy for one reason.....it avoids all clichés that the original trilogy didn't. In fact the film pretty much avoids all clichés at all. I'll try and explain a few without spoiling the film.Well first of all the woman in this film aren't morons. One of the main problems I had with Sam Raimi's films was the fact that all woman were pretty much portrayed as objects that Spider-man can save. None of them do anything helpful. Sure Mary Jane tried to hit Doctor Octopus with a plank in the second film, but she couldn't even do that right. That's not the case here. Gwen actually has a confrontation with with villain and she doesn't screw around, I won't say what she does but when I saw it happen I couldn't help but cheer. Finally a Spider-man film where the woman have a brain-stem.The second cliché it avoids is being predictable. The original films basically have Spider-man going through the motions. Girl gets kidnapped, Spidey saves girl, Spidey defeats villain or jumps out of the way so the villain can do harm to himself. That is not the case with this film, a lot of the time you think one thing is going to happen but then it doesn't and the opposite happens.The third cliché it avoids is having silly moments. The first trilogy had a lot of them, yes even Spider-man 2 (The raindrops keep falling on my head scene). Going back an having re-watched the Sam Raimi trilogy before seeing this one, the films are more like popcorn films. Sam Raimi is the master at making B movies and that's what the original trilogy was, an epic scale B Movie. With this film, they get a little more serious. There's not really any goofy moments that I can think of and if there are then it's usually played for laughs.Also THANK GOD They got Flash Thompson right. Sam Raimi used Flash so he could be the stereotypical bully, and at the beginning you think that's what Marc Webb plans to do, but then he shows that Flash isn't as big a  as he makes himself out to be. Flash is one of my favourite Spider-man characters in the comics, and I'd like to say ""thank you Marc Webb for avoiding the cliché of him just being a bully and actually making him a human being with depth."" The film also does other things right besides avoiding clichés. The actors all do fantastic jobs and I will go on record saying that Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-man and a great role model for young boys even though he has his flaws. Martin Sheen was great as an Uncle Ben who is kind, understanding, but at the same time doesn't take any crap. Emma Stone was great as the kind of jokey but intelligent Gwen Stacy who is a strong positive role model for young woman. The Guy who played the villain was great, The girl who played Aunt May was good in the few scenes she was in. Not a weak link in the bunch.So I've done nothing but praise this film so far, so why is it still behind Spider-man 2 in my books? Well the film does have flaw, mainly two. One it's rushed, the only one who really pays for it being rushed is the villain who only gets one line of dialogue to explain his motives and even then we're not sure why he's doing that. The second flaw is that it doesn't have this big epic feel that Spider-man 2 had, it doesn't feel like it was ma","

The storyline was OK-ish, but I felt is was a touch too simplistic. I am not aware of the comic book history of Spiderman, it never appealed tome as a child, but surely, Spiderman would keep his identity hidden from everyone. In this movie, the Spiderman character seemed to spend most of the movie with his real identity exposed for all to see.. The acting was a bit wooden for me, but it is not the worst movie I have seen this festive season. 8 out 0f 10 is my festive spirit generosity score.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","smallasianman","19 June 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man begins with Peter Parker in high school. Though an amateur photographer, Peter's main interest is science - and he bluffs his way into an audience with his deceased father's ex-partner Dr Curt Connors. After impressing Connors with his knowledge of cross- species genetics, Peter enters a classified area and is bitten by a mutated spider. As his powers and secret identity develop, so too does his relationship with Connors protégé, and Parker's classmate, Gwen Stacey. But when the desperate Connors attempts to fight his personal weaknesses using the same untested method, he undergoes a more disastrous transformation into ""The Lizard"", a creature with a twisted view of how best to 'cure' humanity.The Amazing Spider-Man's origin story is undoubtedly an improvement on Raimi's Spider-Man, a decade prior. The characterisation is a lot more realistic, which makes it easier for the audience to feel Parker's teenage pain, awkwardness and ultimate escapism when he dons the guise of Spider-Man. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacey is also a welcome replacement for Mary-Jane, who's sole purpose in Raimi's films was either to moan or scream. Stacey by contrast, is an intelligent character in her own right, who doesn't shy away from getting her hands dirty when Spider- Man's in trouble. Rhys Ifans portrayal of Curt Connors has the same Jekyllian vulnerability seen in Mark Ruffallo's Bruce Banner earlier this year, although his motives are distorted somewhat as the film progresses.However, such interesting character development unfortunately does not hold together perfectly with the action. Of course, Spider-Man is foremost a movie that has to entertain; yet the cocky web-slinging CGI hero seems too unlike Garfield's brooding Peter Parker. The quality of the special effects is largely inconsistent, with POV scenes of Spider- Man diving around the city impressing greatly, whilst his actual battles with The Lizard are considerably less ambitious. The weighty retelling of Parker's familiar back-story also means that during the dénouement several large plot points, which could have expanded the action, are left undeveloped – and so the ending is a little too simple and unsatisfactory.Webb has successfully addressed the new demand for superhero movies to be deeper and more human; yet he is not a director adept at providing big-budget action to an audience in the same way as Joss Whedon or Christopher Nolan. The Amazing Spider-Man is therefore the sum of two films, a satisfactory coming-of-age movie and an unchallenging action film. Unfortunately, Webb is not strong enough to convincingly hold the two together.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Dominic_25_","5 July 2022","This is Sony's first attempt at creating a superhero universe. Of course it didn't turn out spectacular. They were aiming for a setup film, not a solid film.Why did they cast a 30 year old Andrew Garfield and a 24 year old Emma Stone to play high schoolers?It has been a while since I've watched any movie so why not watch a superhero movie that was trying to capitalize on the growing trend. This film feels like it was trying it's hardest to be a hip cool start to a new universe. It starts with a setup for Peter's parents being secretive scientist types before just transitioning into teenage Peter being awkward and struggling with high school stuff. Peter finds his dad's stuff then investigates his work and gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider then works with his dad's old colleague on his work. If that sounds like a lot that is because it is. Not even half way through and it's pretty much a mystery of this science stuff his dad was involved in but wait then it kills Uncle Ben and turns into a vengeance story and finally we get to see Spider-Man, and he's literally just hunting down people that sort of look like this killer. He is obviously acting like a bad guy but the film makes it seem cool with Spidey tricks and banter. From here the plot devolves into nothing more than a tool to get to cool scenes and shots. Nothing interesting or logical happens, the second half is pretty much get to the big fight scenes and make it look cool.There are cool shots and I appreciate the film making NYPD look incompetent and unnecessarily violent.It takes a dark turn on superheroes by accident by toying with the authoritarian nature of the concept. I'm not a very big fan of this Peter, maybe it's because everything about his personal life is consulted for no reason, maybe it's Andrew Garfield's acting, maybe it's just that they don't do a very good job of making the character and letting him be a person. Instead we get the opening sequence then a montage before the movie throws random stuff at him and he makes the wrong decisions for most of the movie.Overall it's an uninspiring movie that gets to where it wants to go and tries to be interesting visually, which it largely succeeds at (especially compared to the MCU and their stale colors). Really just kind of forgettable.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","redcanofevil","15 December 2021","Doesn't quite reach the highs of the Sam Raimi films but not bad in anyway. Gets the vibe of a Spider-Man just right which other films fails to do so. The duality of Peter the highschooler and Spider-Man the superhero was very much front and centre even tho not all it does worksFor starters an infinitely better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire. When I picture Spider-Man from the comics its the closest to Andrew Garfield. Also a very solid Peter Parker but the script lets him down most of the time. The shy, nerdy, quippy and tormented highschool Peter was well handled altho a little less stuttering would've been nice. My only complaint would be Andrew looks older than the age he is supposed to be at times.One of the best chemistry in a Spider-Man movie with Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone who was perfect in the role. Tobey-Dunst felt very artificial whereas Andrew-Emma is so free flowing and organic. Gwen was always my favorite Spidey girl and this movie proves itAction scenes have been vastly improved and altho its still CGI looking it gets the Spider-Man fighting style perfectly. Not the best of casting choices for the villain and the lizard design looked weird trying to make it as realistic as possible.As for the duality aspect it is surprisingly emotional and very well acted for the most part. But the script really doesn't help the actors and the direction also lets it down at timesThere is not much wrong with it its just that its not as good as the 1st 2 Raimi films. Don't get me wrong this is a better Spider-Man movie than all the Sam Raimi films but the Sam Raimi films were better movies. Its just not as tight and cohesive even tho it gets Spider-Man closer than all the other attempts. For all its effort it does lack in iconic moments and doesn't have many nostalgic moments as the Sam Raimi run.RATING: 8/10.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Platypuschow","5 February 2018","I was deeply unhappy when I heard about the filming of The Amazing Spider-Man, I believe in original ideas and with something as broad as Spiderman at least giving it a decent length of time before ""Rebooting"".It was too soon, the quality of the McGuire trilogy is irrelevant it was simply too soon to be starting again. Yet another origin story, another introduction to Gwen, another uncle Ben death scene and another villian.Andrew Garfield is dull, he simply didn't cut it as Spiderman and I consider Emma Stone to be one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood so the newly reborn franchise wasn't off to a great start in my eyes.So at over two hours at least they gave the movie a chance to shine, alas it doesn't though it's not the complete train wreck I expected.In this outing (And origin) Parker takes on The Lizard played by the always excellent Rhys Ifans who is simply too good for this movie.It has its moments but for $230 million it damn well should have had considerably more.The Good:Crane scene was greatLizard looked decentDennis Leary & Rhys IfansThe Bad:I really don't like Andrew GarfieldWeak soundtrackWas simply too soon after the last ""Reboot""Things I Learnt From This Movie:Some Lizards can grow limbs back at will...........at will!?Along with super powers spider bites also provide personalities","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","IonicBreezeMachine","2 January 2022","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is an intelligent high school outsider. As a boy Peter was left by his parents Richard and Mary (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) to be raised by aunt May and uncle Ben (Sally Field and Martin Sheen) only for Richard and Mary to mysteriously die in a plane crash shortly thereafter. Peter evidentially stumbles upon his father's personal effects which leads him to investigate bio-science company Oscorp and one of Richard's colleagues, Dr. Curtis Conners (Rhys Ifans), who worked with Richard on cross-species genetics. Peter investigates Oscorp where classmate and crush, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) works as an intern and Peter is bitten by a spider from one of the labs. Eventually Peter starts to exhibit enhanced strength as well as the ability to stick to walls and following the death of his Uncle Ben begins to form a reputation as masked vigilante Spider-Man and at odds with the police department headed by Gwen's father George Stacy (Dennis Leary). Meanwhile, Dr. Connors is under increasing pressure from Oscorp's dying CEO Norman Osborn and using a compound made from lizard DNA based on Richard Parker's formula ends up becoming a reptilian human hybrid, known as The Lizard, intent on spreading the compound throughout the city.Following the commercial success of Spider-Man 3, Sony and Sam Raimi had every intention of moving forward with Spider-Man 4 as well as preliminary discussions regarding Spider-Man 5 and 6, however the mixed critical and fan feedback lead to tensions between Raimi and the studio as the overcluttered narrative of Spider-Man 3 was the result of Sony's insistence on Venom's inclusion to plant seeds for a spin-off and with Raimi suffering from burnout from the tumultuous development cycle of Spider-Man 3 and already butting heads with Sony over whether The Lizard or The Vulture would be the primary antagonist, Raimi departed from Spider-Man 4 and the rest of the cast soon followed suit. Sony had already planned for such a contingency with writer James Vanderbilt producing a treatment that would eventually be directed by 500 Days of Summer director Marc Webb and feature Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. The results despite covering familiar ground were surprisingly good and gave a different experience from the Raimi movies.Andrew Garfield gives a more contemporary take on the character with his interpretation of Peter Parker being less in line with the broad silver age inspired take of Magurie's Peter Parker and mining the more contemporaneous attitude of ""Nerd culture"" that's much more mainstream than it was in the 1960s. While Peter is still very much an outsider in High School, the portrayal of it feels like an attempt to ground it more in our reality than the previous Sam Raimi movies that were trying to replicate the environment and delivery of the 60s comics and characters but placed in modern day. The Peter Parker of The Amazing Spider-Man is also a much more active protagonist where Peter's story in the opening almost plays him like a teen sleuth with the lingering mystery of his parents connection with Oscorp as well as their death in a plane crash used for some tense scenes that also work in justifying Peter going to Oscorp where he receives his Spider powers from the bite. Emma Stone is also quite good as Gwen Stacy who not only has strong chemistry with Peter and works as a love interest, but her relationship with Peter where she becomes the only Confidant of Peter's who knows he's Spider-Man as well as a intellectual equal to Peter gives her more agency as a character than Mary Jane Watson had from the Raimi movies with some solid scenes of Stacy assisting Spider-Man. Rhys Ifans is good playing damaged scientist Curtis Conners and the scenes Ifans shares with Garfield are really solid as Peter learns about his father from Conners while Curtis also sees a bit of Richard in Peter and there's a strong undercurrent to these scenes that make them very rich in character. Ifans also does well portraying Conners' transformation into The Lizard in a way that's more than a little reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum's take from the David Cronenberg helmed The Fly remake.The action are really solid as they build upon techniques from the Raimi movies but also adjust them to the new world created by the movie. Unlike the Raimi version of Peter, this incarnation of Peter doesn't shoot webs from his wrists and is positioned as a technically accomplished genius with his web shooters gadgets that he builds using Oscorp tech. There's also a lot more weight to the action and some solid scenes showing Peter's rough Spider-Man costume to the eventual final costume.The major points of criticism I think will be in regards to the retelling of Spider-Man's origin story and in the Oscorp conspiracy plotline involving Peter's parents that while inspired from revelations in the comic-book does feel at odds with Spider-Man's everyman core. While the movie does give us different takes on Aunt May and Uncle Ben that have more dimensionality than they had in the Raimi films, it doesn't disguise the fact that we already know Uncle Ben's story significance and what happens to him. I also didn't feel like Sally Field's take on Aunt May ever achieved the level of chemistry with Garfield's Peter that Rosemary Harris had with Tobey Maguire in the Raimi films. The movie also doesn't give us much satisfaction in its conspiracy plotline that's pretty obviously set-up to be a driver for sequelization.The Amazing Spider-Man works well as an origin story for a new take on Peter Parker. With a strong supporting cast and some exhilarating fight scenes, the movie manages to overcome its origin story baggage with a mostly successful take on the character and lore. While the background plot involving the mysteries behind Peter Parker's parents is inspired from developments in the comic book, whether you like it or not will vary from person to person.","

This movie is very different from the original, except for the origins which can obviously not be changed. The action is what spidey fans have always dreamed off. The chemistry between peter and Gwen is priceless. New and interesting story lines are created to be explored through out the trilogy/saga. The new suit is great in my opinion, but it has been changed for the sequel, yet either way I like them both. Andrew Garfield's emotional scenes are unbelievable. Finally, I absolutely loved the humor. And the ending left me satisfied and happy, yet excited for what is yet to come. Overall, this is an origin that succeeds on many levels and out does the previous origin (which is still great) and only Spider-man 2 is equal in its acting, style, humor, action, and theme.","

He's an extremely talented actor, and it's safe to say that the reason why this movie didn't get such a high rating might be because people weren't pleased knowing that someone else would be taking up this role after Tobey. Some might have been disappointed, but the truth is that this movie is incredible. For me, I've never seen anyone bring such a role to life as well as Andrew. Props to him for delivering the way he did! He will always be the amazing Spider-Man.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","dp-17275","26 February 2019","It's a good movie, I recommend it. It really does nothing new with the Spider-man character but its a fun watch. Andrew Garfield fits into the role of Spider-man perfectly, but struggles to become Peter Parker; since Andrew Garfield does not have that same boyish charm Tobey Maguire had, he is not a nerd and you never believe it. The villain is pretty good, very over the top, but in the first 40 minutes he's interesting and unique, until he isn't. The villain is the lizard and seeing him fighting Spider-man is fun. The music is acceptable, it gives Spider-man a nice theme you can hum and the movie is quite inspiring. The end fight is very fun to watch and if you invest in the characters enough, you can feel some emotion in the end. Gwen Stacy is an excellent character and has great chemistry with Peter Parker. The origin story is kinda fascinating until you realize it's a more dumb downed version of the Raimi origin story. Uncle Ben literally says 'with great power comes great responsibility' but he couldn't say that exactly because then people would accuse it of being too similar, instead he says ""Your father had a philosophy, that if you could do good things for other people, you would've had a moral obligation to do those things. that's whats at stake, not choice....Responsibility' such a dumb downed speech. Excellent special effects and sometimes does feel like an attempt to 'Dark knight' Spider-man but regardless of that it's a very fun movie and I highly recommend watching it but don't try to compare it with the original because then it won't be fun.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","StoryTaker1","3 May 2019","I guess whether or not we like a super-hero movie depends on what we are looking for in it. I want them to inspire me to always strive to be the best version of myself. I want them to unapologetically show heroes being heroes, without caring if that makes them 'cheesy', protecting and defending more than they attack, constantly learning from life and from others, overcoming personal struggles and losses, using their brain more than their brawn etc. I especially love any story where the protagonist is smart and a fellow nerd. This movie does it all for me.Garfield might be too good looking to pass off as a bullied teenager, but he made up for that with his acting. He portrayed perfectly the awkwardness that bullies would hone in as a weakness, the need for validation that comes from this and from losing his parents that led him to give the formula away so callously to please Dr Connors, the rebelliousness and teenage angst etc. I also liked the tragic arc of Dr Connors and how his path to the dark side was paved with good intentions. I also liked all the side characters and Gwen. The humour was also on point, as was the music.More importantly, I like and admire the Peter Parker in this movie. He is a true hero through and through who is also incredibly smart and can build his own suit and solve his own problems unlike in certain other adaptations.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","2 June 2018","I loved the SPIDER-MAN trilogy starring Tobey Maguire a lot. At first, I didn't understand why he was no longer in this movie, but after catching it just a few weeks ago on DVD, I can say that this a very cool SPIDER-MAN movie. The title is apt. The film is replete with cool action, vibrant VFX, a great execution, and of course, loads of entertainment.Andrew Garfield plays a very cool Peter Parker, much different from the one played by Tobey. But I never compared them both because it's clearly visible that both actors have portrayed different ages of SPIDER-MAN and shine in their respective parts. Andrew however also shows the hilarious side of his web -shooting alter ego very well. Emma Stone has a great chemistry with him, and acts well for the most part. Rhys Ifans is impressive as both Connors as well as the Lizard. It was a very pleasant surprise to see Irrfan Khan in the film, and he played his brief yet significant part with utmost sincerity. Martin Sheen did a good job as Uncle Ben, while Sally Field too portrayed Aunt May with an emotional flair. Denis Leary is impressive, while Stan Lee too has a funny cameo in the film.Coming to the technical department, it's hands down a very impressive film. The entire visual effects which make Lizard are marvellous. The best visual effects in the film, however, are in the climax. The action is simply outstanding. Every action sequence is impressive, and the final action block which also has added emotional and inspirational depth, is highly impressive and entertaining. The film has a lot of funny as well as emotional moments. Undoubtedly, there are some similar points as in SPIDER-MAN, but Marc Webb's direction makes this reboot, an all new and all different experience as a whole.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Movie-ManDan","19 October 2014","Spiderman 1 and 2 were masterpieces. Spiderman 3 in 2007 caught a bad rap because it was much inferior to the previous ones. So they rebooted the series. Thing is, they did it way too soon: 5 years after the finishing if the original. Everything would have been so much better is they waited longer. But noooo! I watched this with an unbiased conscience and did not expect it to be as good as the original. Many times whenever I have low expectations, I am proved wrong. Not with this.Let me start off with the story. Peter Parker is left in the care of his aunt and uncle some time before his parents die. Years later, as an emotionally scarred teen, Peter finds some answers about his parents that change him forever. The only thing good about this is giving a backstory to Peter and his parents. Nothing on Peter's childhood involving his parents were mentioned in 2002's. Props there. Plus there is lots of science involved, so any science nerds would love that aspect. I hate science, but thought it made great filming. In general the story has a good pace, but it is so unoriginal. A teen trying to find his place in the world has been done so many times with this not being any different. Then there is the love story between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey. Sure the chemistry between them was better than original movies, but this is so unoriginal and boring. Peter gets the girl after the first try and it turns into cheesy Channing Tatum/Patrick Swayze love fest that makes you reach for a barf bag.Now let's talk about characters. Martin Sheen wasn't a bad Uncle Ben, but his death scene was hilarious and forgettable. Sally Field sucked and Aunt May. The ones that played them in the original were much better and the relationship between them and Peter were much, much stronger. Flash was not a good bully. Curt Connors (acting wise ) was good, but was a crappy villain. James Franco, whom I thought was the worst villain in the previous was better than Connors. Gwen Stacey was likable, but unoriginal. Her father was likable, but unoriginal. Peter was likable, but inferior to Tobey's. Andrew Garfield does not do a good job of playing a meek, timid, geeky teenager. Tobey owns that portion. Garfield just looks like a One Direction dude with glasses and a skateboard. People say Garfield was wittier and did more wisecracks like in the comic. Tobey did wisecracks too, but Garfields are too long and unfunny. Busting the car thief was extremely dumb. Tobey would have done one line and kicked his ass. After becoming Spiderman, Garfield doesn't really change, staying a confused, sad teen with no goal in life, except finding his parents' history. That makes him one-dimensional. Tobey goes from being a total geek to a sophisticated gentleman. Tobey outacts and outdoes Garfield in every was. Tobey also gained lots of muscle and easily could have whooped Garfield's skinny ass.Lastly the movie itself. Spidey's suit looked sick. Better than Tobey's? Maybe. Science thing superior to the oldies? Yes. Uncle Ben's death? Hilarious, and all because Peter couldn't get a bootle of milk he could not afford. Peter's ambition? gives up pretty easily finding his uncle's killer and is dead-set on finding his parents' history. Peter's family background? Better than the others by explaining his parents, which barely do! I know that they wanted to make the viewer want to see the sequel but going through a full movie just saying where they worked sucks. Peter exploring his new powers? Pathetic! Spidey saving a kid? Both almost died because of Peter's sheer stupidity of negotiating with a 6-year- old! The lizard villain? Looks exactly like that Jim Henson kiddie show from the 90s called ""Dinosaurs."" Action good? Yes. But there's many parts where the camera shakes at such a wide range with no focus for so long while Spidey's flying around, you may need your barf bag again.Final thoughts. This movie was not bad, nor good. The action saved what was a major stinker. The story isn't boring, there's just unoriginality and stupidity surrounding it. And it is very forgettable. I noted specific things in this review because I watched this just yesterday. Yet I still forget half of it!1.5/4","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","ForTwentyYears","8 July 2012","Perhaps it is because I'm not an needlessly cynical old man lacking a sense of humour, but many reviews I've read are unfair. I just got back from the cinema, and I was so so so surprised by the awesomeness of this movie. I remember enjoying the first Spider-Man but this just completely blew that out of the water. Firstly, I think I laughed more at this film than most comedy movies. I was literally in hysterics at some of it - as was everyone else in the cinema. Namely, the part where a robber gets out a knife and Spider-Man cowers on the floor saying sarcastically something like ""oh no you found my weakness - it's small knives"" before whipping up and shooting his badass webs at the dude. Oh god I laughed so much. And this part where he first gets bitten, comes home, proclaims he is hungry and proceeds to taking an armful of /frozen/ food upstairs while his aunt an uncle just stand there looking utterly confused. Honestly it was just hilarious. When he wakes up in the morning and practically demolishes his bathroom and all the doors. After kissing his girlfriend ""I'm going to throw you out of the window now."" ""Wha-?"" SMASH! Hahaha. Sarcastic protagonists make every film better. I want to see it all again! The story was also good, I liked the way the webs didn't just blast out of his fingers without reason but instead he created them from wires. And the whole sci-fi aspect was really interesting. It was a great curveball that Connors didn't actually start out evil but in fact it was almost Peter's fault he turned all lizard-y. There were also some really emotional parts, and I won't say I didn't cry because the development and everything just made them tenfold more heart-wrenching! I also thought it was good that they kept the human aspect of the superhero - he get's injured and he feels pain which, to me, isn't a weakness it's just inevitability. ACTORS. Oh my god. They were all epic as hell. Garfield was just amazing, it was a completely different role from The Social Network and yet he slotted into it so naturally. He got the emotion, connection, humour and just everything down to a T. Emma Stone was also beautifully flirty and awesome. I was glad she wasn't the usual whiny, helpless female sidekick. Every single actor was FLAWLESS.The visuals were also very aesthetically pleasing. Camera angles and scenes which made the 3D aspect perfect. I'm also very happy that they didn't go down the whole ""OMG CRAM IT FULL OF CGI AND DAZZLING MONSTERS SO THEY DON'T NOTICE THE CRAPPY PLOT L0L"" route.My only downside is the backstory which didn't fit together or wasn't fully explained in some parts, but it didn't really matter because the rest was so satisfying. I've seen people say Parker and Spider-Man were too different in personality, but honestly did they not catch the ""your boyfriend is a man of many masks"" part? Or the part with the kid where he wears the mask and it makes him brave? It's obviously like bravado. At least, in my opinion.Oh I absolutely loved the ending, when he breaks up with Gwen because of the promise. Then when he comes into class late and promises never to be late again, to which the teacher replies ""Peter, don't make promises you can't keep"" and as he sits down behind Gwen he whispers ""but those are the best kind.""To conclude, it was a wonderful entertaining movie which I thoroughly enjoyed. Ignore the whiny negative reviews!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","sherring8290","15 July 2012","This is a new origin tale of Spider-Man and how he came to be. Rather than action driven sequences, The Amazing Spider-Man consistently uses the strengths of its actors to create a compelling story and characters the audience cares about. Columbia pictures not only told me we are indeed ready to re-visit Spider-Man's Universe, but ready to finally do it right in the process.The Amazing Spider-Man takes us on the journey of Peter Parker, a bullied, self-classified science nerd. On an uninvited trip to Oscorp in attempt to discover more about his perished father, Peter gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider. After this event everything changes. It's a familiar story to those who have seen the original Spider-Man trilogy, but how this story is told is what makes it different. Almost two thirds of the entire film is dedicated to character development and it sure paid off.Andrew Garfield plays Peter Parker in this reinterpretation to the world of Spider-Man, and he couldn't be a better fit. Not only does he simply fit the suit better, he adds a level of emotion and comedy that Tobey Maguire severely lacked. The Spider-Man of the comic books was sassy during fights, spouting off insults and egging his opponents on; The Amazing Spider-Man nailed the character perfectly.Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, a science wiz intern at Oscorp, and Peter's love interest. She does an excellent job of stealing the spotlight while on screen and remaining an afterthought while off of it. One scene in particular I enjoyed was the first time Gwen and Peter try to set up a date. Their innocence and insecurity is highlighted as they fumble for words which provided not only humor but a chance for the audience to connect with both leading characters.Rhys Ifans plays Dr. Curt Connors, a top scientist at Oscorp studying cross genetic mutation, and ironically ""The Lizard"" as well. This was one character that I felt lacked in some areas. As a scientist Ifans nails it; he shows absolute interest in the studies and even possesses the personal goal of re-growing his right arm. Where the character falls apart is when the Lizard is introduced. After a certain point his goal completely changed: he was no longer about the science but purely selfish.Other actors that gave excellent performances are Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy, Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben, and Sally Field as Aunt May. Their performances were over shadowed by the main three but I felt they deserved a mention.Villains are a huge part to any super hero movie or comic and unfortunately this is the one area I feel this film falters. The lizard just didn't do it for me; he isn't the evil villain many including myself were hoping for. A scientist trying to cure his own ailment turned evil, which was not well explained causing a small hole in the plot.The writers of The Amazing Spider-Man are clearly avid fans of the comic books and the accuracy of details really paid off. Attention to details like the fact Spider-Man made his web slingers (he did not possess the ability internally as shown in the original Spider-Man films) really increased the likability of the characters and script.The Amazing Spider-Man is just short of amazing, which is no small feat for the folks at Columbia Pictures. Should this film be the success it is expected to be, sequels will no doubt come, and frankly I can't wait. This film not only left me wanting more but revitalized my faith in the genre. Oh, don't forget to stay for the credits! There is a short clip giving hints of what's to come.see more reviews at http://www.thosetwoguysonline.com","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","The_Celluloid_Sage","6 April 2020","With a director called Webb, how could this not be amazing? Exactly, this is streets ahead of Raimi's offerings (despite personally being a huge Sam Raimi fan) but they really were too mushy and casual for my liking. Sony's new reboot of Marvel's Spider-Man hits all the right notes in my opinion, especially in the casting department. Maguire was just too...well, too wet for my liking. I have nothing against the guy so whether it was direction or script I'm not sure (or he just isn't an actor suited for that role). Garfield on the other hand nails the portrayal of Peter Parker as far as I am concerned with his geeky, cocky and youthful portrayal of everyone's favourite web-slinger.The film opens to Peter (Garfield) shouting for his father in his fathers study. Drawers are open, papers thrown around and the room is in a state of general disarray. Peter's parents are hurriedly running around before leaving the house with him. They take Peter to his Uncle Ben's (Sheen) and Aunt May's (Field) house where he tries to eavesdrop on the conversation they have. Peter's parents then leave him there as they leave. We then quickly fast forward to the present day and to a teenage Peter along with all of his teenage problems and issues. During a clean out of the basement with his uncle Ben, Peter comes across a leather briefcase that belonged to his father leading to Peter to start investigating their disappearance all those years ago.Ok so let us start with the major talking points regarding this film. Was it completely unnecessary and unneeded? Very likely so yes. Does that make it a pointless film? One could argue that yes it does (and I hate remakes, reboots, re-imaginings and re-whatever else) and this would fall into that category. Do I hold the same view with this film as say something like Tarantino ripping off every great foreign film he has ever seen? No I don't. Why? Well maybe I am a hypocrite and also maybe I don't really see superhero films or franchises like this being the same as a classic one-off film. Hell, this franchise has been done to death over the years, and yes I include the awesomely, terribly bad short-lived TV series too. Was five years long enough to wait to reboot the character again? I guess your mileage will vary depending on your personal opinion of the previous three films.My personal opinion of the three preceding films wasn't great if I'm being honest. I'm sure many will hold them in high regard as the first decent Spider-Man films to have come along. I didn't for various reasons, including those I stated above. Was it also right or wrong for Sony to re-use many scenes or make them similar? Another debatable point indeed but they did and so it is what it is. The only thing there, is did they manage to improve on those instances. I for one think they did. Was the former trying to be a more mature Spider-Man rather than this version? I think they were aiming for that, but Maguire and Dunstan (in my opinion) ruined any chances of that along with the script they had to work with. Is this iteration perhaps aimed at a more younger audience? I would say so yes and I think it works, while this one also has its darker moments.So what does this new reboot version have going for it? Well for one, and this is a big one, Garfield is head and shoulders better than Maguire in pretty much every aspect for me. His looks, his physique (and let's all remember folks and remove the rose-tinted from the Raimi films, Spidey was never big, never overly muscular or imposing in any way). Garfield was perfectly cast, acts the character wonderfully and is brilliant with his cockiness and the old Spidey sarcasm. My biggest issues with the Raimi films though is, Spidey wasn't really Spidey at all. Maybe I am biased with this one but I also feel the interaction between Peter and Gwen (Stone) is infinitely better, but then maybe I just prefer Emma to Kirsten.The rest of the cast are equally as good, Ifans, Sheen and Leary all shine, though it is a shame (personally) that sheen did not have more screen time, but the time he does fill he fills big. Sally Field really doesn't have a lot to do in this one and is somewhat wasted for someone with her credentials, but like the others she does add a star quality and a 'name' to the cast. Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors is excellent and hams it up wonderfully as The Lizard. Likewise, Leary is near faultless as Gwen's father and Captain of the force. Other supporting characters are well cast and all play their parts well enough.Another plus I have for this film is that it takes much longer for Peter to become Spider-Man. We get a lot more back-story regarding Peter and what happened with his parents than we ever did in the previous trilogy. I feel this is to the betterment of this new reboot and works well with our new antsy Parker. We learn more about Peter and thus connect with him better. The second huge plus for me is the web shooters. what was Raimi thinking in all seriousness? Back to how it should be, Peter showing his genius and intellect by designing his wrist worn web shooters. How they always have been, how they always should be. Spider-Man is just physically enhanced due to the spider toxins. He is not Brundle spider.It really is a shame that Marvel did not keep Garfield on in the role of Parker/Spider-Man as I feel he really brought something to the suit. Overall though this is a funnier, less nerdy, more intricate telling of Spider-Man and his origins with a much more human and believable Peter Parker. if you have seen the Raimi trilogy and not caught this yet, just keep an open mind and enjoy a visually good looking film which is based in more physical reality. If you have not seen any of them, I personally really would just stick with this. Sorry Sam.The Sage's Rating: 7/10","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","StonedMagician","27 July 2019","Reboots/remakes are very controversial (let alone common) in Hollywood these days. Some of them have been welcomed (Star Trek, Casino Royale), and others not (Let Me In). The Amazing Spider Man, a reboot of the franchise begun by Sam Raimi's 2002 film, is one of the latter. Many critics seem predisposed to disregard this film, given the extremely positive response the original received. A similar thing happened when Let Me In first premiered: do we really need this movie, when the original was both great and relatively recent? The answer, of course, is no. But the fact remains that it exists, so critics should leave their grudges behind and concentrate on the film itself. Sam Raimi's version made light work of Peter Parker's transformation. Sure, the general concepts were in place; he gets bitten by a mutant spider, develops superhuman powers (though he cannot generate the webs himself in this version), and sees Uncle Ben get gunned down. And really, that was about it. Marc Webb, known for his well-handled rom-com 500 Days of Summer, imbues Spidey's origins with considerable depth and humanity. When Parker discovers his uncle's killer sports a tattoo, he pins any crook he can find to the wall to check if they're the right one. The chief of police points out that Spider Man doesn't seem to have any agenda, and is nothing more than a vigilante. After this, Peter seemingly decides that he can do far more than simply take vengeance, and decides to take on the real menace, The Lizard. Of Sam Raimi's trilogy, the best villain was Doc Ock, from Spider Man 2. As a character, he was fascinating, and brilliantly acted by Alfred Molina. The Lizard, whose human form is portrayed by Rhys Ifans, is little more than a miniaturized Godzilla with a plan. While Ifans plays his part quite well, The Lizard is simply not as charismatic or terrifying as Ock was. Like DOc Ock, however, The Lizard (AKA Curt Connors) is a sympathetic villain, with (initially) benign intentions that are completely understandable, and enough to pity him by the end of the film. Peter's love interest is Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), a smart, pretty, resourceful young woman who also happens to be the daughter of the police chief. She and Parker (Andrew Garfield) share excellent chemistry in their interactions, which director Webb exploits to its fullest potential. Their romance seems many times more genuine than that between Parker and Mary Jane from Raimi's trilogy. Parker himself is just as likeable, and far more unsure of himself. In this version, he stutters sometimes, and seems like the type of socially awkward nerd stereotype that everyone seems know someone like. It makes him easier to relate to, and thus easier to accept as a character, adding immeasurably to the film's human side. The other side of the film, of course, is the CGI-driven action. Sam Raimi, employed his signature style to his action, meaning that everything was complete chaos. Entertaining to be sure, but not always easy to follow. Webb anchors everything firmly in the realm of possibility (or at least as close as it can get), and there are no crazy gadgets flying through the air this time. Now, it's only Spider Man, the cops, and The Lizard. It all feels much more efficient and streamlined as a result, and becomes all the more thrilling because of it. Overall, I would recommend the reboot over the original, but only just. Sam Raimi may not have handled the dialogue and story as well, but is much more confident and fluid in the action space. When the inevitable sequel comes around, Webb might be able to take more risks with the web-sliging and baddy-wrangling, but until then, this is a very good film that no Spidey fan, casual or otherwise, should pass up.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","mrooney98","3 July 2012","I enjoyed this movie because it was a superhero film with many funny bits. I like to be able to laugh while watching a movie, not just watch loads of CGI action. I also liked the fact that the villain wasn't killed just defeated and put in prison, giving him a second chance. However, I do believe that was partially do to the fact that the producers/writers wanted something to write a future film on. I think that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did exceptionally in their roles. Garfield really seemed to actually be Peter Parker and I love to see that in a film. Although this movie is a superhero movie I do believe it was geared toward a younger audience, unlike the Dark Knight. The fact that Spider-man is a teenager in this one and that it is not nearly as dark as some other films certainly convinced me of this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys action and superheroes. Side note: Denis Leary was great!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","philipjkite","3 July 2012","I don't like to be the downer on this movie, but I've just got back from watching it at my local cinema and I've already forgotten about it! I was expecting good things, 215 million spent on the movie, Emma Stone (big fan), Andrew Garfield (up and coming, great in Social Network) and Martin Sheen as a co-star, come on it should have been better.I got lost in the lack of a plot, it felt like it all happened over a day or two, the acting was limited, even Emma Stone only seemed to convince in a few scenes. At times it was as if I'd gone back in time and was stuck watching the Hulk again! please, please, not again! It just seemed so mixed up,there were a few, and when I say a few, I mean more than two! decent scenes! a couple of jokes thrown in, but then it was back to mediocre, what the heck happened to Denis Leary, after Rescue Me, you'd think that this guy could act now.For me, and this is only my humble opinion, it was a bid disappointment that made me wonder why I went in the first place. Once again Hollywood got me, with their big budget advertising machine. But maybe it's me, IMDb's never wrong is it? and maybe, just maybe, as I didn't watch it in 3D and could see the movie this time, I'm wrong!","

Thomas Howell. Unnecessary but entertaining none-the-less blockbuster reboot to the epic Marvel franchise in its re-imagining of the Peter Parker mythos of his web-slinging alter ego super hero whose origin story should now be known to every man, woman and child. Garfield - exuding James Dean cool/geekiness as the awkward teen - is indelible as he tries to find out who he is, why he is and how to use his powers for greater things (that's right crime fighting). Ifans is reptilian to the hilt as anger management in denial Dr. Curt Connors, a one-armed colleague of Parker's late scientist genius dad attempting to use hybrid species DNA for re- growth of lost appendages and instead becomes the menacing Lizard. Added to the mix is Stone as Pete's gal pal Gwen Stacy and a nice laconic by-the-book Leary police chief dad out to stop the masked vigilante in the jungles of Manhattan. Director Marc Webb (no puns please) does a remarkable, skillful and unlikely heir-apparent helmsman job with the Herculean task of making something old fresh and he's ably capable with a decent script by James Vanderbilt, Steve Kloves an Alvin Sargent (who scripted the last two SPIDER-MAN flicks under Sam Raimi's realm) and some truly vivid 3-D imagery CGI and fantastic lens work by John Schwartzman. Bonus: Stan 'The Man' Lee's fun cameo as a high school music librarian missing out on the action behind him! Get your web on!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","preppy-3","19 July 2012","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a radioactive spider and has the powers of a spider and fights crime as Spider-Man. He also falls in love with beautiful Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) whose father (Denis Leary) just happens to be the chief of police and hates Spider-Man. Then there's doctor Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) develops a serum that he hopes will cure people of any ailment. He tries it on himself and becomes the Lizard who wants to wipe out the human race.OK--I never liked the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies. I thought he didn't look (or act) like Peter Parker and was WAY too low-key as an actor. Garfield looks like Parker--but his acting is terrible. He's all over the place and never seems to get a grip on his character's pain and anxiety. Also the film is slow-paced and--frankly--just boring. I kept looking at my watch! On the up side the acting (Grafield aside) was excellent. Martin Sheen and Sally Fields were great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Stone was sweet, innocent AND sexy as Gwen Stacy. Leary was good as Captain Stacy. It was also great to see Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz briefly as Peter's parents. The CGI and special effects were flawless--but we've seen this all before. There's no sense of wonder and amazement at what Spider-Man can do. We KNOW it's done by computers and that robs it of any sense of magic it might have. Boring and badly done. I give it a 2.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","interquam","29 June 2012","Emma stone and Andrew Garfield spend a lot of time in each others breath.An ensemble cast that is superior to other films with a pathetic story and average cinematography. A very good script with good actors and failing plot.Mr Sam Raimi should have made this movie keeping the actors same including the screen-play.Fairly good direction but i don't want to pay for seeing school-kids lick and salivate in each others mouths.Maybe if they would have taken Sharlto Copley instead of Rhys Ifans i would have added another 3 stars.Its a romantic movie gyrating around the emotions of school kids peter parker and Gwen Stacy .......everything else takes a backseat. I was bugged and so i went to take a leak during their kiss.Technically the movie is flawed. The spiderweb is not produced by his own body i reckon, but a device he built that produces the web. Another thing CGI is crap. You don't expect it to get overlooked with cheap multi-core chips and GPU's. Sub-standard quality-less animations.Oh! the bad guy-- a giant lizard that can easily be squashed by a freight train or truck........Duh.Much better than Prometheus because actors are very good.I would applaud Andrew, martin,Chris Zylka, the whole cast and the screenplay guys for making this film OK.....the story and romance just makes me crap in my pants.Too much melodrama and emotion.Spiderman 3 can be renamed: The Amazing spider-man.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","tareqzaghal","2 September 2023","Watching these after the Raimi films really exposes how the Webb films lacked a lot of heart and mistakenly chose to focus on the 'edgy' post-TDK/Chronicle comic-book approach. The first half of the film is really melodramatic, and it feels like the film does not organically reach any of the key Spider-Man story tropes but feels obligated to check them off for the sake of the origin story, and in a very familiar and effortless way.I love Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man, but I do not enjoy his performance as Peter Parker in this first film. He comes off more of a dick than an innocent and helpless guy, which Tobey was able to perfectly capture. The whole film is very 2010-ish in every aspect, which sometimes provides a nice feeling of nostalgia but other times does not help the film at all.I would have preferred if the entire reboot skipped the origin story, but not in the way the MCU Spider-Man films did, but in the way the Spectacular Spider-Man animated show did. It could have provided a fresh take on the character for the big screen, as well as even avoiding repeating similar story beats to the Raimi films after only five years.On a technical aspect, there is some great cinematography especially during the fight scenes, with the high-school library sequence with the Lizard being one if my favourite Spider-Man fight scenes on film. Other than that, everything else is a bit uninspired honestly, nothing memorable.My favourite thing about this film (and the sequel) is the relationship between Garfield's Peter and Stone's Gwen, and their unbelievable chemistry. I love how she has an actual role to play in the film that is organic to the overall story, and it tied up well with her father's arc and the ending.This film's a bit over-hated imo but I do recognise it's many flaws. An overall enjoyable film that gad the impossible task of following up Raimi's trilogy.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","XweAponX","27 November 2012","Sam Raimi's 2002-2007 Trilogy was fantastic - He totally captured the essence of Spider-Man. But Marvel Comics themselves constantly re-tell the stories, and sometimes re-invent their superheroes, so also do Filmmakers who are telling, and in this care, re-telling these stories.Sam Raimi was not called on to do the re-telling, this time it went to newbie Marc Webb. How did he do? Not as well as Raimi did with his first two installments. But swell enough, to keep us interested. Is this an unnecessary re-telling? That's a big ""Nope.""Andrew Garfield is the new Peter Parker. He is less of a wimp than Tobey Maguire's version: Less of a wimp. But more of a geek. He's better at science than Maguire was. He Skateboards. He even stands up to Flash Thompson, stupidly, but he shows a measure of bravery, which Tobey lacked. He is also taller than Tobey Maguire.This new kid has it built in. he is intelligent, Maguire not so much. He's sharp, Maguire often did not know what was transpiring under his steamy glasses. He is not shy like Maguire was, where Maguire stood with thumb up it, Andrew Garfield acts. This is not to say I am not endeared to Tobey Maguire's version. But this new kid has his own way of doing it.We also delve into a subject that was not looked into very much in the Spidey Comics I had read-What happened to Parker's Parents, who they were, what did they do, and how Parker ended up with Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae? Campbell Scott is Richard Parker, a scientist working for Oscorp, and Embeth Davidtz is Mary Parker, Peter's doting mom. As a kid, Peter Parker was played by Max Charles. Sally Field is Aunt Mae and Uncle Ben is Martin Sheen: THIS I liked very much.Richard and Mary Parker are frightened by something. Their house has been burglarized. Richard has some secret papers in a hidden drawer: Peter sees this, he remembers. He remembers his father's leather attaché, and the papers inside. But the Parkers are frightened, They drop Peter off at Uncle Ben's and are never seen again.Next Scene, Peter Parker is in High School, photographer for the school paper, geek, but respected. Has the gall to call Flash Thompson by his real first name, which he is rewarded with by a butt kicking. Enter Gwen Stacy aka Emma Stone. Perfect. She knows how to deal with Flash.A leak in the basement draws Peter's attention to his dad's Attache Case. There is a photo of Richard Parker with ""some guy"" (Rhys Ifans) - Uncle Ben tells Peter later that this is Dr. Curt Conners, who was a friend of the Parkers.These family ties are tightly woven threads of the story. Peter Parker is very much Richard Parker's son. But he does enjoy a close relationship with his Aunt and Uncle.Peter finds the compartment in the attaché case that holds papers with the symbol ""øø"" and some scientific formula. Looking up Conners on the computer, he sees that an internship program has just started, so he goes to Oscorp and sneaks in. On an escalator, he sees a representation of the shadowy image of Norm Osborn.As it happens, Gwen Stacy is the head intern, but she lets Parker stay. He gets Conner's attention by knowing the answer to a question he asks the interns. But then he bumps in to a man named Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan) and sees that ""øø"" symbol on a paper he drops. He follows Ratha and finds a room with the same symbols, spiders fall on him from a machine.Gwen Stacy finally kicks him out and this is when he is bitten.From this point in the film, it matches some of the events from Raimi's version - He plays around with his new abilities and in standing up to Flash Thompson, gets into trouble, causing Uncle Ben to be called to Mid-Town Science (The school where Parker went), and phase one of the Uncle Ben ""responsibility"" lecture.After school he goes to see Dr Conners and tells Conners who he is, giving him the formula which he did not know that his father was keeping from Conners and the rest of Oscorp.Missing is the whole ""Wrestling Match for Money"" angle but the story with Uncle Ben is pretty much the same, he is killed by a petty thug, causing Parker to go out vigilante-style. Unlike Maguire, he cannot shoot webs from his fingers, he uses webbing he gets from Oscorp to make the Web- Shooters. Eventually he makes the costume and then goes out hunting some more - THIS is where Andrew Garfield is very good as Spider-Man, he is VERY good with the Spidey-Cracks. ""Hey! I'm Swingin'' Here!""Denis Leary is Captain Stacy, Gwen's dad, who Parker has several confrontations with as both Parker and Spidey: This is an excellent character, especially when Parker starts showing interest in Gwen.Most of this film shows the results of Peter giving the formula to Conners, who uses it to mutate into ""The Lizard"" and how parker as Spider-Man corrects that mistake with Gwen's help, and the ultimate cost. The problem with this film is mostly the Digital Lizard, which although done well, is just too difficult to believe. But Spidey's fights with the creature are a good blend of practical filming and CGI. The Raimi films have too much Digital Spider-Man, most of the Spidey in this one, are really Garfield or whoever is in the costume doing stunts.I liked this more than I expected to, and I was very pleased with the chemistry between ""Parker"" and ""Gwen"" and the way Parker/Spidey admits to Gwen that ""The Lizard"" was his responsibility. The ""Power/Responsibility"" connection was not preached out at us, is was worked into the story on a gut level.","

But... it just really didn't grab me. The plot was fairly dull on a macro-level and the dialogue within the script was pretty bland. I would've loved to see Andrew Garfield's take as Spider Man with a better script. The visuals were fine (it's a superhero movie) and Sally Field is always fun to see, but not much else really is sticking with me about this film beyond Andrew Garfield's infectiously likable performance. Didn't hate it, but I won't remember it.Also, I have to say-I really couldn't get on board with the school scenes. The single least believable thing in this film (a film including a giant lizard monster and someone getting superpowers from a radioactive spider, mind you) is the fact that someone who looks like Andrew Garfield was a loser in high school. Nope. Kid would've called all the shots in my high school and many others. The man is a demigod and radiates that energy in any role he's in... which makes him hard to buy as a social outcast.","

Dr. Connors is amazing, when he transforms its gnarly, it gives you the feel of how he is being taken over.There are some plot errors, like how does he get the web slinger stuff, and what happens to the semi transformed cops, while they are transformed. but other than that it flows pretty nicely.","

Andrew had the wise crack of Spider-Man because if you read the comics or watch any of the cartoons, you'll see Spider-Man as a wise cracker and as Peter Parker, he has nerdy, but he is more than just a nerd. He was also a teenager who had friends. Emma Stone was a much better romantic lead than Kristen Dunst. And I thought the action was much better than the first Spider-Man.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","milsir-31457","19 January 2022","Of course, it's a banality, but sometimes, in order to move forward, you need to take a step back.After the Avengers, together with alien hordes, defeated the central districts of New York, took part in the disappearance of the ""fabulous"" Sokovia and for sure, not once again, will be seen in many epic battles, the local confrontation between the Vulture gang and Spider-Man could seem faded and of little interest.But the authors of Spider-Man: Homecoming did such a filigree and verified work, having got a recipe for universal content somewhere, filled the picture with events and characters, whose jokes are laughed at and empathized with, not only children and teenagers, but also viewers with experience.Everything worked in the film, or almost everything. Starting with Peter's video blog, with the fact that the viewer is not forced to once again stare at spiders and bite, Uncle Ben and Peter's emotional lamentations and moral dilemmas, they omit a lot that is already well known to everyone, and go straight to the main and much more delicious.Everything looks interesting, as if on the screen there is not a movie about Spider-Man, but a very fresh and original story. The characters are not played, the return home is like a report from that, well, that universe, they are all alive and real. An excellent effect that the authors of the Marvel universe managed to achieve.The idea of a new costume for Spider-Man looks advantageous. In the era of gadgets and smartphones, Peter just needed this kind of costume, as well as a school party, their nerdy circle, which only adds to the picture of advantages.Spider-Man: Homecoming is a bold, modern, not devoid of youthful enthusiasm and creative imagination film. A very strong solo album, for a very green Tom Holland. Excellent work, keep it up.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","alexdelliott","10 July 2012","STORY Well the story is fairly obvious, guy gets bitten by spider....guy becomes Spider-Man. It has been seen. However, its the other subplots and character developments which make this film actually (in my opinion) better than the 2002 film. I felt more attached to the characters like Uncle Ben for example. I won't go into details as I don't give spoilers but it was more emotional, and characters were much more relatable. The only real flaws I thought were the villain who's scenes felt a little rushed and the film didn't dwell on his character enough, and also the fact that Peter just wasn't nerdy enough, although that may be down to casting. 3/5EXECUTION Firstly, I really enjoyed the directing, and with the 3D it did actually look pretty impressive. The camera work was smooth and really made each scene stand out especially the ones that actually showed Spider-Man. The acting was good all round, I think Martin Sheen stole some of the scenes he was in and Rhys Ifans played the part of Dr Connors really well, although he probably was't seen enough as I would have liked. Andrew Garfield is a good actor but I'm just not sure he's right for this role, Spider-Man is meant to be the repressed but sarcastic science geek and that just wasn't carried out well. This is just nit picking though, the film was executed very well in my opinion. 4/5CONCLUSION After being dragged to this film by some mates, it was a nice surprise when it actually turned out to be good. It was slightly more gritty and emotional than the 2002 film whilst staying true to its roots. I'd recommend a watch as its probably worth seeing. At the very least I think people will be glad they saw it. 3/5 + 4/5 = 7/10","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","ferguson-6","7 July 2012","Greetings again from the darkness. The big debate seems to be whether it is too soon for the Spider-Man franchise to be re-booted. It was just 10 years ago when Tobey Maguire first appeared as Spidey and a mere 5 years ago when director Sam Raimi delivered the last leg in his trilogy. Obviously the reason to re-boot starts with ""doll"" and ends with ""ars"". It is more interesting to decide if this is an improvement over the previous series.We must first look at Spider-man himself. Played here by Andrew Garfield, we get a more thoughtful Peter Parker and a more athletic Spidey version than we had with Maguire. As usual, my pet peeve is that Garfield is a 28 year old man cast as an 18 year old high school science nerd. Looking past that, Garfield manages to pull off the stunts without looking too much like a real super hero. So that's a plus. Luckily for him, his scenes with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) work because Ms. Stone is such a super talent. She makes everything she is in, just a little bit better.Next we look at the villain. Rhys Ifans plays scientist Dr Curt Connors, who transforms into Lizard in the quest to regenerate growth of his lost right arm. He was once partners with Peter's dad in their research into reptilian genetics. While Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) from Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite villain in the series, it's clear that Lizard is certainly capable of frightening the younger viewers, so parents beware. It should also be noted that Dr Curt Connors was played by Dylan Baker in the Sam Raimi trilogy.Lastly, we look at the story. This take is much more personal and provides detail to the backstory of Peter Parker. We learn how (but not exactly why) he lost his parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) and see how he came to be raised by Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). We see how he and Gwen Stacy come together and learn that she is every bit his equal intellectually, if not a notch above. Casting Dennis Leary as Gwen's Police Chief dad works as Leary and Garfield exchange barbs at the table. Peter is still a photographer, but this time for the school instead of The Daily Bugle ... whose logo makes an appearance on TV.Director Marc Webb was somehow selected for this despite his only feature film being (500) Days of Summer ... not exactly a film known for its CGI. Admittedly, the CGI used here is less rush and cluttered than in previous Spidey films and many of the stunts look to be real stunts instead of the fake stuff. The closing credit cookie clearly sets up the sequel, though I can only guess that the shadowy figure is Norman Osborn. That's still up for debate.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","SnoopyStyle","17 August 2013","It's a new reboot of Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). This time, the love interest is Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). There is a bit about his parents tying them to Peter's powers.Marc Webb takes over the franchise. It's a surprising move but he does a good job. It's slightly less comical than Sam Raimi. Andrew Garfield is the same age as Tobey Maguire when he started, but Andrew looks much older. It's hard to imagine him as a high school nerd. Andrew looks his age which is 27-28 whereas Tobey always looks like a kid. Andrew really looks like one of the cool art kids with a guitar. Emma Stone is great as the love interest. Rhys Ifans is the villain but the problem is his CG avatar. He's a lizard and doesn't have much personality. Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock are far superior villains than Rhys Ifans. So the franchise continues, but not a total revolution. Just new people. The constant rebooting may wear people out someday.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","GaawiinMashiNinibaasiin","3 July 2012","This movie truly delivers. Great cast, great acting, great story, great action, and most importantly great story telling. It's one of those movies that put you at its mercy. Slowly its invisible web tangles you around and before you know it, you're bound and powerless. You get immersed to the story, to the emotions of the scene. You can't help but to feel what Peter Parker is feeling. His pain, his anger, his joy, his anguish. And you want him to win over the villain. You're relieved when he overcomes obstacles. Then at the end of the movie you enthusiastically clap your hands together to applaud the great performance that you just saw. That's how I felt. I was reluctant to see it at first. The trailers didn't impress me. I've seen previous movies with Tobey Maguire and thought that they're pretty well made. Though I'm not a fan, the fact that they cast a different person to play the role of spider-man this time around was both confusing and appalling to me. Had the ticket not been free, I wouldn't have gone to see it. I came to the theater with no expectation other than that I'd be disappointed. But this movie turned me into a believer. This is the best spider-man movie. Andrew Garfield is Peter Parker. He even sounds like Peter Parker from the cartoon show. His performance was so great it's infectious. He deserves an Oscar notch for this role. Why not? Why can't a movie be entertaining and Oscar worthy at the same time? I'm sure this movie has flaws when you dissect it. And I'm sure it disappoints a lot of spider-man fans in some ways. But sometimes you just have to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. What a great ride it was for me. 10 out of 10.PS. I saw this on 2D.","

I wish they'd get it straight: does the web come from his body, or is it an add on he has to wear to create the web? I'm so confused!!Also, IMHO, I don't think the guy the casted was 'right' for Spiderman. Sure, they teased him at school, but he didn't really give off the 'I'm a nerd' vibe. The hottest girl in school already thinks he's cute - and he didn't have to really try. Finally, the worst villain they could come up with is some lizard boy? WHAT?RECOMMENDATION: If it's between mowing the grass in 90 degree weather, and watching this.... it would be a hard decision, but I guess it would be to watch this?","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Califorever1","21 December 2012","I first was going to see another movie, but my cousin wanted to see this. I walk into the movie theater thinking: 'Yeah this'll probably suck and be boring' and came out with chills. I saw this movie in 3D and it felt like I was there with the actors, in all the scenes! Of course the fight scenes were a little bland and they could have added a little more action. But the part when Peter is Spider-man and he was doing flips up in the air, also swinging across buildings, literally gave me an adrenaline rush. It was an amazing feeling.But the best part of this movie wasn't the action, but the chemistry between Peter (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen (Emma Stone). Every time they had a scene together, I could absolutely tell that they were in love. Their love story was one of the best parts of this movie because it blossomed from them being cute and flirty, to being completely head over heels in love with each other. They were both charming but also pulled it off as their character very well; Emma as the intelligent, graceful Gwen, and Andrew as the cute, but awkward and nerdy Peter. They were definitely the highlights of this film.Like every movie, it had it's flaws. I think that they could have chosen a better villain than 'The Lizard'. Don't get me wrong, Rhys Ifans was a good actor in this film but his character just felt rushed to me. One moment I see him as a brilliant, kind-hearted scientist to him then becoming psychotic and turning himself into a giant green monster way too quickly. Also, I didn't think he looked like a lizard at all. Honestly, I think once he turned into 'The Lizard' he looked a lot like 'Lord Voldemort' from 'Harry Potter'. He was the only character I had an issue with though everyone else was great and was perfect for their part.Another issue, that a lot of people complained about was the lack of thrilling fight scenes. The fight scenes in this movie were a little cliché like you have seen it in another action movie. Also the fight scenes just kind of came and went. They were so quick and just very boring, like you knew every move Spider-Man (AKA Peter) was going to make. I thought they should have put a little more effort into these scenes and they should've put a lot more action into them.Honestly, overall this is a terrific movie! Despite some flaws, I think it is definitely worth seeing. Andrew and Emma are very charming in their parts and look adorable together on-screen. It has some cute lines were I had to laugh out loud because they were just really funny! If you like a super-hero movie with a comedic and romantic twist into it, I think you will enjoy this movie!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","JeffTheBadger","26 June 2012","To start off I want to say I enjoyed this movie but even as I type that I do question exactly how much.People have talked about the CGI not being up to scratch and parts of the 3D being blurry but I don't think that was the problem. The action was great, the characters were good but it seemed to be one ""amazing"" set piece scene after another with very little connecting them. I often found myself wondering what happened to get from point A to C, B seems to happen off screen for a large portion of the film.I know the words ""gritty"" and ""dark"" seem to crop up every time someone talks about a good superhero film but I don't think that needs to be the case, I like superhero films to be larger than life – that's kind of the point! For the inevitable comparison with the Sam Raimi spiderman film, I would say it is more gritty, a little darker, slightly less fun and a lot less coherent.An overall enjoyable watch but not sure ""amazing"" should have been in the title.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","blandiefam","5 July 2012","I paid good money to see this and I was truly disappointed. The acting was superb and the cinematography was better than the Raimi version, but the buck stops there! Sam was a better story teller and you felt you didn't need to know much about the character before watching the movie. This new version lacks the plausibility of the whole story. It seems the director, Webb, wanted to make the unreal more realistic and bring him into our world not realizing that movie goers want to be transported into the world of the fantasy and get a break from ours. Garfield played a brooding web-slinger who was more concerned about finding himself than the killer of his Uncle. I know this movie stayed true to many parts of the comic book, but the character development was lacking and was only compensated by the brilliant actors playing the key roles. Spidey Sense was nowhere in this, his ability to heal quickly, and his reporter angles were also omitted. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that all of New York knew he was Spiderman. All except for Aunt May. I must say that no matter how old Sally Field gets she is still too sexy to play Aunt May. The wrestling angle and the slaying of Uncle Ben were too rushed in my opinion. Lizard seemed too powerful to be foiled by the weaker watered down version of Spiderman. Maybe Mr. Webb believed he was more qualified than anyone else because of his name. Even the explanation of how he got bitten was never properly explored. Garfield has a James Dean like quality in his acting and you felt as if you were more comfortable watching PP outside of the costume because Spiderman's identity was never truly developed. I would recommend watching the first two Raimi Spiderman movies than this watered down hapless version. The ending left you dissatisfied as if you were given a Whopper without any meat.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","aaronjbong","3 July 2012","Who doesn't know Spider-Man, especially when a trilogy of films based on the superhero started a little over ten years ago? All three films have been tremendous successes and have become movie phenomenons. Sadly, the third film was a mess, filled with too many villains and disastrous subplots. So to make things easier, they went for the 'reboot' route with Marc Webb replacing Sam Raimi, Andrew Garfield taking over Tobey Maguire, and Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy replacing Kirsten Dunst's MJ. Luckily, they did a great job of it.The story of Peter Parker's origins in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not necessarily the ""Untold Story"" as the advertisements say but rather a revamped version. It goes back to basics, taking the key plot points of the original ""Spider-Man"" film and putting it all together with a few more details and finishing touches. Peter Parker, an orphan living with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, is in high school. He's nerdy and sort of unsociable. He has a hobby in photography although his true passion lies in Science. In an attempt to discover his father's secret life, and of course due to curiosity and stubbornness, he gets bitten by a modified spider and gains his superpowers. His superpowers however don't include being able to shoot webs out of his hands as now he uses mechanical devices to shoot out the webs.Those who watched the 2002 original blockbuster may feel over-familiar with the first hour of the film as it stays very similar with it. Even Uncle Ben's death is present here, albeit killed by a different person. However, I must say that the origin story is done perfectly and more enjoyable than the one provided in the first film. It's more detailed and his parents, especially his father, is more involved here. It's also surprisingly more touching, and more emotional.Here, the villain is someone who hasn't appeared in any of the previous films. It's no other than the Lizard. Apparently the Lizard is the result of an experiment done by Dr. Curt Connors, who is the working partner of Peter's dad, Richard Parker. Both of them have been working on cross-species genetics planning to cure others. Unfortunately, Richard died in a plane crash along with his wife resulting in Peter becoming an orphan. Connors has also lost his right arm in an incident and has been observing the regenerative abilities of reptiles (particularly the lizard) in an attempt to grow his right arm back. With the help of Peter Parker, he successfully creates the serum and it worked. However, it does just more than that, the serum completely changes him and turns him into a monster named The Lizard, now equipped with superhuman strength and abilities.Gwen Stacy's is Spider-Man's main love interest here. Unlike MJ, she is also interested in Science, not someone into singing or anything like that. In fact, she is like the assistant of Dr. Connors and works in Oscorp. Even though she loves Peter Parker and knows of his secret identity, her father is apparently Captain George Stacy and Captain in the Police Department and has issued an arrest warrant for Spider-Man. So much trouble. This creates a stronger romance for the film and is definitely another triumph over the original Spider-Man.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" offers very powerful performances by the actors. Andrew Garfield gave a great performance as the newly revamped Spider-Man. However, I thought that he would be unsuitable as he would look like someone you don't want to mess with and hardly a nerd. But that all changed when I saw this film. He successfully gave Peter the teenage personality needed and was stunning. Emma Stone also gave a great performance as Gwen Stacy and the chemistry between the two leads were convincing. Rhys Ifans gave a cruel and menacing portrayal of Dr. Curt Connors and also did a great job.The reboot also had impressive 3D effects and one of the few films that uses the 3D wisely. The sets more realistic and envelops you into the action. Talking about action, the battles here are also very exciting and creates high levels of suspense. However, I thought that some of the action sequences are less creative than others and therefore not consistent. The battle in the bridge was satisfying whereas the battle in the school was less creative although it incorporated a very humorous scene. Just when you thought Spider-Man was becoming ""Batman Begins"" and descending into darkness, it instead became an action film filled with lots of humor too. There are many comedic scenes that make the film fun and not too depressing. The most humorous scene was actually the one with the signature Stan Lee cameo, the creator himself. This is by far the best Stan cameo I've ever seen and was very hilarious.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is amazing indeed. It has great acting, impressive 3D effects, and a detailed familiar plot. The two things that downed this film was probably that familiar feeling of the plot which makes it less intriguing (especially when the original film just came out a little over ten years ago), and the less creative battles in the movie. However, the former can be repaired by the more detailed additional plot points and polishes to the origin story. Otherwise, I enjoyed the film immensely. It had a great villain, fun comedic moments, exciting action sequences, and a strong love subplot. I would say that this reboot is probably better than the original, far better than the third, and on par with the second. And watch for that one scene after the credits start rolling. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" offers viewers an excellent reboot to one of the greatest Marvel franchises ever, thanks to Andrew Garfield's excellent performance, and director Marc Webb who has polished the origin story and crafted an action-packed, emotional, and funny superhero film.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","psionchronicles","30 July 2012","Rating this movie comes down to a value judgment. If you are an aficionado of the silver age comic books, it may leave you wanting. Significant liberties were taken with the characters and their story lines to create a Spider-Man that today's kids may relate to more, as well as to improve the believability overall. Is Andrew Garfield the Peter Parker we grew up with? Hardly. But he's a Peter Parker that makes sense in 2012. The original Peter Parker was better played by Toby Maguire--straight-edge to the point of sickening, always worrying about his Aunt May getting upset. This Peter Parker, like a typical teen, wants as little to do with ""'rent"" figures as possible. Gwen Stacy has been updated as well; her demeanor is more like that of a 30-year-old than a teen in the beginning, then she deteriorates into a love object straight out of any teen exploitation television series. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are good choices for their roles, but again, you need to be ready for major storyline alterations. It is as if the writer and director went out of their ways to change things for the sake of changing them.My chief complaint about the movie is the CGI. CGI is like makeup on a woman: it should only be used by someone who knows what they are doing, and usually less is more. As many years as Hollywood has been using it, very little progress has been made in making organic things look realistic; the technology so far lends itself much better to machinery and starships than to living things. The Lizard looks like a setback to the original Shrek animation--clumsy and cartoonish. Even the Geico gecko is more convincing. Hopefully in my lifetime, they will perfect the movement techniques to the point where most CGI looks real and not like a FPS game.To be fair, if they were going to reboot a franchise, they couldn't just repackage old ideas. The movie is watchable, regardless of your background. But a sequel to it probably wouldn't be. I shudder to think what this crew would do to the Green Goblin.","

The film was beautifully shot and the set pieces where Peter Parker discovers his powers were amusing and well filmed.

I seriously loved it, ignore all the haters, these people just can't get over the fact that This film was superior to Spider-Man 2002. It is a 'realistic', contemporary and a grounded approach onto the Character by the Director Marc Webb, yet staying faithful to its source materials( combo of The Amazing and The Ultimate Story lines). Of course, there are a couple of plot holes, but I am sure they'll be explained in the upcoming Sequel. I Must say that Andrew Garfield brought justice to the role of Spider-Man. An absolutely amazing and a highly gripping movie. I highly refer it to any True Spider-Man Fan, as the people who have never read the comics might call it a 'rehash' of the First Spiderman movie, but actually, this movie stayed fairly true to the comics from the beginning to the end. 9/10 stars from Me !

The villain comes, he threatens spider-mans girlfriend, they fight for a bit, and the villain kills himself. the movies rush any accuracy it was going for like making him spider-man after he graduates and giving him Mary Jane before Gwen, and don't get me started with the green goblin. making him the goblin before you show the power hungry business man what where they thinking? But when i saw this film i cloud have never been this happy since the dark knight, its not better than the dark knight or its equal, but just as the dark knight finally made a batman film I've been waiting for, the amazing spider-man did the same with spider-man, it made some changes necessary for it to be a movie while keeping true to its source material its the Peter Parker I've been waiting for, its the girlfriend I've been waiting for and hes funny hes smart his body looks like a spider rather than a sumo wrestler and the bad guy is serious, and the ending fight is different like when Parker warns his girlfriend that the lizard is coming instead of being kidnapped she helps people and uses a blow torch to fight him off, and the side characters are developed not so many throw away characters, so yeah i love this movie i want to see where they take it next.","

This movie serves justice to the MCU comics and the roll of clumsy yet smart Peter Parker, which is something i think lacks in the new movies with Tom Holland. Also the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is insane , more mature and raw than in the new marvel adaptation, without mentioning this movie has just the right amount of comedic aspect which adds points in things I didn't like about the new MCU adaptation with Tom Holland, like I felt I was watching a Comedy for the whole ass movie and I'm not saying is bad to have comedy but the whole movie just felt like satire.Don't get me wrong it's not like I don't like the new MCU adaptation and I love Tom Holland but this one is just more related to the comic and overall better.","

Emma Stone was also a wonderful, important part of the movie. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors was absolutely brilliant and his transformations as the lizards could not be any more creepy! Marc Webb owned Spider-Man with the fight sequences and web slinging. The best Stan Lee cameo of all time. Webbs version was overall way better than Raimi's depiction! The movie stuck with every comic book aspect including the web cartridges and Peter's first love Gwen Stacy. A must see movie and it does stick in your mind for a bit.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","cdaddy","3 July 2012","This movie is as bad as the previews. The direction was bad, the acting was bad there was major plot holes. I had no interest in really any of the characters. The action was boring also. There was zero chemistry between spiderman and Emma Stone. I almost walked out about midway but I wanted to give it a chance. The lizard man looked really lame also. One thing I hate when I am watching a movie is the characters motivation, why is he/she doing this or that? I should not be asking myself ""why is this character doing that"". I am also really sick and tired of nearly 30 year old actors playing 16 year olds! Spoiler alert!! I though Spiderman was in college, he is playing a high school kid? I loved some of the actors in this movie but I did not like them in this. The action was bad, I kept thinking to myself, isn't this the same thing we saw in the other spiderman movies? I thought the choice for spiderman was really bad. He did not do a good job. I really didn't like this movie.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","elroy_geronimo","19 July 2012","Girls will love this movie and guys will enjoy it more than an average rom-com but this sh**ty unnecessary piece of sh*t will have all true spider-man fans gagging and rushing for the exit. Too bad it's already a commercial success so there will definitely be a sequel which pobably will be even sh*ttier. Like everyone I'm appalled by the lack of respect for Sam Raimi and for the original comics. I'll admit Spider-man 3 was a mess, but this was the fault of the studio- execs and not of master Raimi... It seems its success is biggest in India home of Bollywood movies. So maybe next time Spidey will be singing and dancing..","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","TheLittleSongbird","28 July 2014","That said though, from personal opinion The Amazing Spider-Man was not a bad film, or at least nowhere near as bad as has been said(again personal opinion), but it doesn't live up to its name. For me, the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man films are better, and while Spider-Man did plod and had too many villains all but one of which were underused personally it wasn't that bad. The Amazing Spider-Man did have things to like, it is very stylishly made and has some very impressive special effects, even if the Lizard takes some getting used to. The action sequences- of which there are a lot in the second half- mostly are exciting with some cool stunts(the one exception is the climax which seemed like it was played and written too safe) and very creative use of Spider-Man's powers, and there are some parts in the story that work, the dynamic between Peter and Uncle Ben is really quite emotionally powerful, the romance between Peter and Gwen is somewhat sweet and the part where Spider-Man saves the little boy is tense and heart-felt. It was also very intriguing with the mystery of Peter's parents which was done quite well. The performances on the whole are also good, Sally Field and especially Martin Sheen are great as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and Emma Stone is a charming and amusing Gwen. Rhys Ifans does bring some creepiness to Curt Connors/The Lizard if not the tragedy(the writing didn't help him though) and Denis Leary is delightful in how churlish he is. On the whole too there is some good chemistry between the actors. I never really warmed to Andrew Garfield though, he did seem too quirky for Peter complete with some forced humour and wasn't enough of a nerd, he wasn't a whole lot better as Spider-Man either, he had charisma but did come across as rather smug and not brooding enough for such a serious tone to the story here. Irrfan Kahn's performance and his character is little more than an extended cameo, not very much to work with and Kahn does little with it. The story does have its fair share of well-done moments but does suffer from an over-familiarity that feels like a more seriously toned rehash and uneven pacing, sluggish in the first half and while much better rushed in some of the second half. The script is never terrible nor is it ever exceptional, there are sweet and emotional moments as well as tense ones but too much of the humour is forced and it interferes with the serious tone. James Horner's score is nowhere near among his best, some of it pedestrian, some of it over-the-top, neither of which Danny Elfman's scoring had. And the film really rushed Connors'/Lizard's character arc, there was real potential for him to be a multi-layered character but here he came across as a one-dimensional villain with no real motivation. Overall, watchable but not close to being amazing. 5.5/10 Bethany Cox","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","ladymoonpictures","5 July 2012","Nothing But a Remake - NBAR! Maybe it was just me, but since the First Spider Man was still modern; still relevant, on the heels of Toby Macguire and Cliff Robertson, WHY did we have to make the same ol thing over again? What: To see if there was an upside down kiss? C'mon! I expected more. The spoilers are...wait! Only everything you saw in the last one! That's all. The kid gets bit on the back by a spider, albeit digital one; Kid meets girl - falls for girl; Uncle gets shot dead; etc., etc. Couldn't they come up with some creative ideas, enough to write a new flippin' story? Like after several Batman movies, we were treated and rewarded with ""Batman Begins""! as a great example. This spider movie version, because of the disappointment of watching the same old plot lines, makes this nothing but a quick spin, with a few new faces and a few changes with story and villain -- this ends up being nothing but a 'cash cow' for the production executives and all y'all have fallen right into their trap.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","christopher-thomas933","6 July 2012","Right i'd like to get into this by first saying that I've never wrote a movie review in my life, but as a lifetime comic book fan and collector i was the first person to say ""ah no can't believe they are doing a reboot!"" ""What was wrong with the last trilogy?"" blah blah.Don't get me wrong when i was a nipper i watched Nicholas Hammond with one web shooter, winch cables, (all be it on a side of a skyscraper!) camp bad guys ( no Batman! How that ever recovered!!!) and terrible fx and i loved it i think i burned out the VHS tape because it was that good. (i was 6!) Then i saw the Rami/Toby movie and loved it but it lacked something. Like Spiderman wasn't Spiderman. The running down the street pulling the shirt open was a little Superman but it worked. Mary Jane? Well if your on the track of Ultimate Spiderman yeah cool. But we're notRami had a vision if he threw the Spiderman humour in there then this movie couldn't touch it but he didn't. No fault of his own. Spiderman 2 had that bank scene it had comedy it was how Spiderman works. Irritating, annoying getting the bad guy frustrated, brilliant! But i think i got my expectations a little high because Spiderman 3 came out and Spiderman/Toby became irritating, annoying, crying baby! I mean come on man up your Spiderman!! I'm not gonna talk about the rest because it was poppycock really. Youtube ""how it should have ended and you'll agree"".Now The Amazing Spiderman. Where shall i start. Cast Awesome! Emma Stone Gwen Stacey? Have you seen the comic book back in the 60's? she looks the same almost spit image, and she was Peter Parkers first love interest way before Mary Jane came along. Rhys Ifans was powerful and this is a guy who does a lot of B movies (Twin Town, Mr Nice) We haven't got to talk about Aunt May and Uncle Ben because they are obviously well established. It makes me laugh the people who say the cast was week! Come on! Get a grip! Its dark its got web shooters, backstory( which was probably open because it can be continued in the sequel. Some numpty said in an earlier review ""the high school doesn't look like it was set in New York!"" my question to his is There is a reason its called ""Middletown"" high school, and if you read Ultimate Spiderman you'll know its set in a suburb of Queens ya dick!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Chris_Pandolfi","3 July 2012","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" will inevitably be compared to and perhaps even attacked by die-hard adherents of Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, most prominently the original 2002 film. True enough, this reboot directed by Marc Webb is pretty much telling the exact same story: A high school science geek with no parents is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, is slightly mutated in the process, and ultimately becomes a masked vigilante that shoots webs from his wrists and swings over and around the skyscrapers of New York City. My fear is that audiences will be so wrapped up in noticing the similarities that they will fail to see all the ways in which this version is different. Yes, there are the technical details – plot, character, setting, casting, etc. – but it has more to do with atmosphere and style than anything else.Raimi's approach was much more escapist, loading the story with action, special effects, and a great deal of humor. There was nothing particularly heavy about it; it was made with the sole intention of being entertaining, and so it was. By contrast, Webb's approach is more introspective and symbolic. The plot is a bit less straightforward, the tone is a little darker, the characters are easier to invest in emotionally, the humor is subtler, and there's less action choreography to gawk at helplessly. Having said all that, never once does Webb lose sight of the fact that his movie is based on a comic book. The slick special effects, the over-the-top fight sequences, the preposterous plot, the now-mandatory cameo appearance by Stan Lee, and even its presentation in 3D ensure that a fun time will be had by all.What really surprised me is that this film is a triumph of casting. Andrew Garfield takes the reins from Tobey Maguire in the role of Peter Parker, who's once again a high school kid and whose genesis into Spider-Man is reexamined. I initially didn't think I would be convinced, given the fact that Garfield is in his late twenties. How wrong I was. Apart from the fact that he still believably looks seventeen years old, he accurately evokes youthful thoughts and behaviors, like riding a skateboard, occasionally being defiant of authority, and making rash decisions without completely thinking them through. Flashback sequences reveal that Parker's parents were forced to go into hiding after his father's office was unsuccessfully ransacked for an elusive research folder; raised by his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), part of the plot involves Parker accessing his father's research files in the hopes of understanding the reason for his disappearance.Parker's classmate and love interest has changed from Mary Jane Watson to Gwen Stacy. She's played by Emma Stone, who somehow has gotten more magnetic with each new role she accepts. Gwen learns fairly early on that Parker is the masked vigilante Spider-Man, who has taken to the streets on a dangerous quest to find the man who murdered Uncle Ben in cold blood; she finds herself torn between Parker and her father, George Stacy (Denis Leary), a perpetually suspicious NYPD Captain who's out to arrest Spider-Man, believing him to be more of a menace than a hero. Like Parker, Gwen has a passion for science and currently serves as an intern for a one-armed scientist named Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who's being pressured by his superior (Irrfan Khan) to devise a cure for the unseen but apparently dying head of his corporation.As it so happens, Connors once worked with Parker's father, their research involving genetic splicing and the regeneration of limbs. It was all, according to Connors, in the name of putting an end to weakness, of allowing humanity a chance to improve. But then he uses himself as a guinea pig for a serum containing reptile DNA; although he does successfully grow a new right arm, he also mutates into a gigantic lizard creature and develops a superiority complex. Humanity, he eventually reasons, cannot be improved and should therefore be eliminated – or, in true comic book fashion, genetically transformed. It's up to Parker to convince Captain Stacy that his target should be Dr. Connors and not Spider-Man. In the meantime, Parker and Gwen must stop Connors before it's too late.As well-crafted as all the scenes were, three in particular stand out as the film's best. One is an action sequence in which Parker, dressed as Spider-Man, has to save a child from a car dangling perilously off a bridge. Another is a quieter moment in which we see the redemption of the school bully, Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka). The last is an incredibly sweet moment between Parker, Aunt May, one that involves a carton of eggs. Are these scenes consistent with the original comic book? How about with Sam Raimi's 2002 film? To be perfectly honest, I believe a debate over which version is ""better"" is utterly pointless. I think of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" as I would a fairy tale; it's not about the originality of the story so much as the differences in technique and interpretation.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","mjplysaght","10 July 2017","So after the mixed reviews of Spider-Man 3 and the aborted plans for Spider-Man 4, Sony decided to reboot the franchise with a new cast, new director and a 'new' story thread.Peter Parker is now played by Andrew Garfield, who is a decent actor but his portrayal as Spider-Man is kinda questionable. Once again, he is too old to pull off the illusion that he's still in high school. Also, the classic archetype of Peter Parker pre-spider bite is that he's a reclusive nerdy brainbox. This iteration of Parker takes a different turn, as Garfield plays the part as a hipster wannabe who is already handsome and charismatic.His love interest is Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone. Their chemistry is perfect together but Gwen's input to the plot is fairly minimal, other than her father being the Chief of Police, played by Denis Leary. Gwen finds out that Parker is Spider-Man and tries to keep the fact hidden from her father, who is out to foil him for vigilantism.So the promotional marketing tried to pass off this movie as the 'untold story' of Spider-Man, which turns out to be a complete lie as the origin story of Spider-Man is rehashed with the only different being a loose thread as to how Parker's parents passed away.Uncle Ben is now played by Martin Sheen who *spoiler alert* dies. Big shock. Parker tries to track down and confront his uncle's killer. Or at least 10-20 minutes of the film focus on his efforts to find the killer, but then that subplot is completely aborted and never referenced again. Instead, we get thrown into a hastily thrown together villain story about Curt Connors/The Lizard, a work partner of Parker's dad, played by Rhys Ifans.The motivation of the Lizard is an unfocused mess. An Oscorp professor with only one arm, specializing in cross species genetics, he gets his hands on an incomplete algorithm from Parker, based off his father's research, in which he tries to use lizard DNA to regenerate his lost limb. Things go horribly wrong when he mutates into the Lizard and then all of a sudden, he goes on a mad rampage attempting to infect the city of New York with the airborne lizard gas and turn everyone into lizard creatures.I gave this film a pass when I first saw it, thinking nothing of it, but in retrospect, it's kind of a mess. Parker's rarely likable, we've seen the 'story' before and there's hardly anything memorable. The only thing I bought into was the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Other than that, this film is a solid 'meh' for the entirety.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","trans_mauro","20 October 2012","It seems that we live in the era of useless remakes...And these remakes are a clear demonstration of the total lack of creativity and originality that has been plagued major (more expensive) cinematographic endeavors. They cannot come up with any interesting characters and stories, and to play safe they insist on remaking (poorly by the way)film after film.Why another Spiderman? Aren't there tons of superheroes that are as or more interesting than Spiderman? Why the same old story where uncles, friend, etc. die? These guys are clearly betting (and winning) on the dumbing-down of the average movie-goer. All they need is to come up with some decent CGI, 3D effects and a watered-down story to satisfy the masses.In an era when Prometheus is considered a masterpiece (sic) by some, Spiderman (1, 2, 3,...3578) will certainly find an eager audience.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Chalice_Of_Evil","1 July 2012","I was never fussed on the Raimi films, as I felt they were way too cheesy and dated. Gone are the irritating narration, cheesy moments/dialogue, costumes that look like they've been purchased at a toy shop and villains foolishly killing themselves. In their place we have a real human story with moments/dialogue that feel natural, a Spider-Man costume that actually looks like Peter could've made it (instead of some professional designer) and a more nuanced villain.While Tobey Maguire played a stereotypical 'teenager' who was obsessed with MJ and got over-emotional all the time, Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker feels much more 'real'. People over-exaggerate his being 'angstiness' (why they got so hung up on him carrying/using a skateboard I'll never know), but he's actually far more believable as a person. His arguments with Martin Sheen's Uncle Ben (who isn't just there to deliver platitudes/utter his 'famous' responsibility line) feel true to life and there's much more depth there.Also given far more depth in this film is the female lead, Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone (who just in this one film feels like a more fully-developed/well-rounded character than Kirsten Dunst's MJ ever was over the course of three films). She's much more than just a 'love interest', displaying intelligence, kindness, wit, strength and understanding. It's so refreshing to see Gwen be someone who catches onto how Peter's feeling and is smart enough to realise at the end that him attempting to stay away from her was not by choice. She *doesn't* hold it against him and is far more mature a person than MJ.Garfield and Stone's chemistry is off-the-charts and that's why their characters' relationship in this movie not only works, but is integral to the story. Some may dismiss it as 'love story rubbish', but it actually adds more 'humanity' to the film (whereas the Peter/MJ relationship was more just about him being into her while she was into every guy BUT him and treating him badly). These two are far more 'equal' in their relationship. Another interesting relationship is that of Gwen's father, Captain Stacy, and how he interacts with Peter/Spider-Man. They don't see eye-to-eye on a lot, but when it really counts, he proves an ally to Peter (while the father/daughter relationship ensures that he actually feels like a character who *matters* in the story).Rhys Ifans' one-armed Dr. Curt Connors proves villains can be more than just people who've lost their minds or have robotic arms controlling them. He's someone who starts out genuinely wanting to help people, but due to forces beyond his control, his pursuit of this leads him down a dark path. Still, his mentor/student relationship with Peter adds some much-needed complexity. I feel people were overly harsh with the criticism of the Lizard effects. Was it really any worse than Green Goblin's Power Rangers costume? At least Ifans' performance can be see through the CGI.Other characters such as Aunt May and Flash Thompson aren't given that much screentime, but in the case of the former, Sally Field makes the most of her screentime (and isn't just there to tell Peter boring stories), while the latter is fleshed out beyond simply being the 'school bully'. Peter's parents are given focus at the start of the film, playing an important role (his father especially). I appreciated the 'realness' of Peter's interaction with his uncle and aunt, as there was less cheesiness/corniness and more believability between them. About the only superfluous character was Irrfan Khan's Rajit Ratha, whose sole purpose seemed to be as the catalyst for Connors' self-experimentation.What I found particularly effective was Uncle Ben's fate. As one expects, his last exchange with Peter is heated, but here there are no final words between them before his passing. It's much more tragic and Garfield does an exceptional job with conveying not only Peter's emotion in the scene, but his guilt afterwards/how it affects him for the remainder of the film. I also liked the movie making a point of showing Peter being an inventor (no organic web-shooters this time!), as he displays his brilliance on multiple occasions, but naturally with brilliance comes cockiness and although some people found his Spider-Man 'annoying', I was thoroughly entertained by his quips and felt he never verged into 'unlikeable' territory.I could never enjoy the majority of the swinging/action scenes in the Raimi films as I always thought they looked terribly fake (especially the swinging). A CGI man flying/flipping everywhere didn't interest me, but here the effects used to bring Spider-Man in his full glory to life are far more impressive/real-looking. There's weight to him and he doesn't just feel like a cartoon. I also loved the look of this film, as it's wasn't afraid to utilise shadows/darkness, giving it a real moody atmosphere (there were even some 'horror movie'-type moments). The film's theme and music in general might be a bit too subtle for others to appreciate, but I found it effective. It doesn't beat you over the head. Also showing considerable restraint was the use of civilian characters in the film, who don't come across as corny, but in fact act like real people who treat Spider-Man as he deserves to be treated/don't turn on him at the drop of a hat.Naturally, there'll be those who cling to the Raimi films, refusing to accept any other version. Stick with those if you prefer the cheese, but I'm someone who wanted a more 'grounded' feel to the character and his setting, which is what this film gave me and why I vastly prefer it to the first big screen iteration. This one takes its time/doesn't rush to getting Peter in the suit and leaves room for things to breathe/feels like a more mature film to what came before, which is why I enjoy it so much. It's a shame this film is so underappreciated/receives unwarranted hate, as I think it deserves much more appreciation. For me, it remains the 'definitive' Spider-Man film.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","gradyharp","27 November 2012","Why we needed another Spiderman series after the recent (2002/2007) Tobey McGuire run is probably the same reason we keep getting remakes of foreign films (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc): they make money. And it looks like the public will never tire of Marvel Comic Book stories, so might as well settle in and give them a try. It is an evening's entertainment approaching 3 hours of visual shenanigans that are pretty entertaining.There are some differences between this Spiderman and the last - aside from cast: the stories are different although they both claim to show the origin of this magic transformation of a lonely confused young man trying to figure out who he is until he discovers some super secrets and the power to change into a humanoid spider-gifted hero. It all starts out well enough - Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is shy and unable to relate to about everyone except his aunt and uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen do a fine job here). He fails at a run-in with the high school bully Flash (a hunky and promising Chris Zylka), is noticed by the perky Gwen (Emma Stone) who is involved in Peter's introduction to scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who is an old friend of Peter's strangely disappeared father (Campbell Scott) and mother (Embeth Davidtz). Peter is smart, discovers a formula in his father's briefcase, and ultimately is able to transform himself into Spiderman - his nemesis being The Lizard who is actually Dr. Connors taking a potent experimental solution. After a lot of flying around on buildings and throwing spider web tendrils at everything including The Lizard, Peter is hunted as a threat until Gwen's policeman father (Denis Leary) eventually bonds with the insecure Peter in a life saving situation. Then we are given footage of what is up for the sequel...The human (read 'credible') parts work the best - Garfield and Stone make a fine pair and Sheen and Field give fine cameos. Once the transformation takes place the film becomes a lesson in special effects and that is fun enough to watch. It just goes on far too long...and there is more to come. Makes you wonder when the next cycle of Spiderman will come along. Grady Harp","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Balzer13","4 July 2012","When I saw the trailer I thought it looked like a C grade movie - ya know not too amazing but not terrible. Then I read the reviews which painted it more of a B grade due to the good acting etc. Just saw it last night and I'd say it's closer to D grade. Other than some real chemistry by the two leads and nice nuanced moments, the film was clearly developed and created by Sony executives rather than the writers or the previously very talented director. Marc Webb's 500 Days of Summer was the Amazing movie on his resume, not this horribly realized and surprisingly boring film. Nothing in it worked: not the set pieces where the action itself was very choppy and confusing and worst of all, not engaging or thrilling. My guess is that Sony needed a hit desperately, felt they had the secret to a successful movie learned from the other 3 Spiderman's, and felt they could push around the writers and the action-inexperienced director and what came out was this very poorly realized film on every level. On the one hand I want it to do well because I think the director is very talented and I want him to have enough success to show us how amazing he can really be on future movies, on the other hand, I'm hoping it under performs and forces all would be controlling movie executives to let good writers and directors do their best work and make good movie instead of subjecting us to a Frankenstein's monster of a film like The Amazing Spiderman.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","kgprophet","7 July 2012","I don't have any childhood attachment to Spiderman like most other people do. I was more a Superman person. When the Sam Raimi version of ""Spiderman"" came out, it was a fresh take and felt it was ""what a Superhero movie should be"". It was not all bluster, and Tobey Maguire had an alluring charm. On the other hand, there was always the moment where everyone could tell we were no longer watching live action, and essentially switched over to watching a Spiderman cartoon. It didn't hurt the quality of the film, I knew from Sam Raimi and composer Danny Elfman's soundtrack work that it was in good hands. That was until Spiderman 3 (see my review). Spiderman 3 did for me what ""Batman & Robin"" did for that franchise. Wisely, the studio put Batman back on the shelf in 1997. The origin story for the Batman franchise was presented in the first film in 1989, SIXTEEN YEARS before the complete reboot and retelling of the origin story in 2005. Here, Sony (watch for Sony product placement in TASM), within just 5 years, is rebooting and is shoving the same familiar origin story last seen just 10 years ago. 16 years is almost a generation between reboots. 10 years for Spiderman is too soon. I have been watching 'modern' superhero movies for the last 12 years (starting with the first ""X-Men""), and there have been some truly great inspirational releases over that time. But there are so many superhero movies out there, and they all have the same clichés now. It is the same generic formula over and over: 1. Innocent Boy 'A' wants to date Innocent Daughter 'B' of Successful Father 'C'. 2. 'A' finds secret power. 3. 'A's father 'D' dies, causing 'A' mental anguish. 4. Scientist 'X' becomes Designated Super Villain 'Y'. 5. 'A' becomes superhero 'Z', both loved and hated. 6. 'Z' Threatens 'B', causes panic in Gothametropolis. 7. 'A' is in mental tug-of-war whether to fight crime or marry 'B'.And so on.. However in this unnecessary Spiderman reboot, the generic formula is worse'D' is also 'X' while 'C' hates 'A' and 'B' knows about 'Z'. I am becoming burned out on the traditional super hero films. No, this reboot is not ""Batman Begins"" just because they put in the Hans Zimmer WWWHHHHOMMMPPP music stings and busy strings in the soundtrack. Maybe they thought this would feel more authentic by adding a lot of old furniture in the movie. They also tried to add authenticity by casting genuine Academy-caliber actors as the aunt (Sally Field) and uncle (Martin Sheen). But as the movie began telling the origin story again, wasting too much time setting up sequel bait, I began to groan almost right away. Andrew Garfield is the new Tobey Maguire, and yes he is a likable boy/man (he looks like a college student going to a high school). His character is not quite the same Peter Parker. Now he is jumpy and has better agility before his transformation. Garfield's charisma wins you over, thankfully, because having to sit through the same story plot points was starting to give me restless leg syndrome. I have been a veteran movie-goer for over 40 years, and I just can't get into cliché teenage romance stories these days. At least the original Spiderman set Peter in college, and a far more interesting life. Scenes of skateboarding and high school socializing are meant to connect with the young crowd, but they feel clunky and cliché nonetheless. I know this is a big 220 million dollar film, so I was impatient for the movie to get to the big action scenes. The movie finally gets you there, and the effects are clearly better than the original ""Spiderman"" for the most part, but that is to be expected over the course of 10 years. They are well done and are exciting, but are relatively straightforward. The villain for this film is a lizardman, who looks menacing enough, but is not a Super Villain by any stretch of the imagination. Any member of the audience who saw ""The Avengers"" earlier in the summer will get a sense of deja-vu, as the Stark tower appears, almost identical, in this film as the centerpiece of the big final action scene. There is a desperate attempt to incorporate a number of skycranes as part of the big finale that makes no sense whatsoever, and provides very little payoff anyway. I was waiting over two hours for this? Yet another fight on top of yet another skyscraper? Been there, done that, way too many times. I will still recommend the film for the action scenes and the ability of Garfield to carry the film. But it is not as good as Raimi's interpretation , especially ""Spiderman 2"".","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","invaderJim","13 July 2012","It has truly come to the point where movies are no longer movies, only tools for making money. The ""Amazing"" Spider-Man is a perfect example. Leaving aside the problems in adapting the characters and stories for a transition in medium from comics to film, the movie simply doesn't work as anything but a marketing campaign. The makers of the film are clearly depending upon the viewing population's willingness to go see the sequel (already in progress), if not multiple sequels, in order to see a real story unfold. Any story that the movie does present is developed through abrupt and sloppy plot transitions, and so much is packed into the available 135 minutes that even a lifelong comic fan will leave the theater wondering who the characters were. The swinging effects were amazing, but of course, if you add money somewhere you must subtract it from somewhere else, and the effects for the Lizard were mediocre at best. My advice is to save this movie for Bad Blockbuster night on the couch, once it hits the redbox.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","ThatDoesntMatter","11 July 2012","I never watch trailers.I love Spider-Man 1 & 2, but I was open to a new take on it. Why not, that was art is about.I liked Andy Garfield in the Social Network, I liked his acting in Never Let Me Go and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.Okay, so I'm ready to be entertained, in 3D no less.I really liked the beginning of the film, it was well-made, well-scripted, well-paced, well-acted.Although little Peter reminded me of little Bruce, the story was different enough because his parents left him without an explanation.What I found surprising was that it was incredibly parallel to Spider- Man 2002 in many regards - I didn't mind that, but it made it very predictable...I had thought they would go down a different road, but no...this is really a re-boot, Spider-Man Begins Again (while soon Batman Ends...;-))I liked the high tech lab (not how he got in there, lol!), I liked the subway scene, that was funny.Gwen is into nerds, okay, whatever...I think the film began to lose me when Spidey had 'fun' with the car thief. I did not find that funny at all, his anger, supposedly rooting in his uncle's death (and that's me surmising it, it does not get explained...) is unbelievable.Then comes the action part, character time over.Unconvincing villain, bad CGI lizard, all very uninteresting.At the end, when I was hungry and bored and just wanted it to end, they go back to a bit of character plot, but I didn't care, I was not involved anymore.It seems so many things were just there to get taken up in sequels...Didn't he want to know what happened to his parents? He got sidetracked so easily.I thought maybe they'd explain how he can control when his fingers are sticky and when they aren't (and how are they sticky through his suit??) Why does a wound in his leg affect his abilities? Are his powers affected by the antidote? Oh nevermind, I don't really care...Imo, the scriptwriter, director and the editor did not create an entertaining whole, the music was strange at times or just annoying at others.What I DID like was the acting in the first part (the believable awkward teenager) and all the classic Spidey poses - loved those! Apart from that, 3D did not add a lot, the flying sequences, while elaborate, did not create a feeling of elation nor were they integrated well enough into the story.So now what I feel like is watching Spider-Man again :-).I was ready for a ride, but just got a bit of good drama at the beginning and a lot of boring action after that. I think I'd rather watch Transformers again...;-)7 stars is actually a bit too high, as I was not entertained throughout, but what the heck, they don't do 6.5...Just my two cents.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","valdoherty84","25 June 2012","I know some of the reviews of this movie so far have been hit and miss, but I personally thought this was an excellent film.I saw one of the pre-release screenings and went in without great expectation as I loved the first Tobey Maguire movie and didn't know what another re-boot could really bring to the character.Firstly the casting is spot on. Andrew Garfield completely embodies the character. I thought Tobey Maguire did a job but Garfield puts him to shame in this movie. Emma Stone was absolutely fantastic as Gwen Stacey Other reviews have asked if this supposed to be Spiderman movie or Twilight, and yes I agree that the film concentrated a lot of energy on the character development and the relationships.I do not see that as a bad thing. Daredevil was not the best movie I have ever seen by any stretch of the imagination, but it made me feel an emotional connection to the characters in a way that many other superhero movies do not. The Amazing Spiderman takes that to the next level.If you are just looking for blockbusting action and fight scenes from start to finish then no, this movie will probably not deliver for you. However if, as a fan of comic books, you are just as interested in the lives and the motivation of both the heroes and the villains and seeing them have to deal with the same emotional issues that you do, no comic book movie has done it better.Go and see this movie! If you haven't seen a superhero film before because you think it isn't your thing, see this one! It brings something new! Not for everyone I guess, but I loved it.","

And WOW i cant believe how ridiculous the death of Peters uncle was! the guy picked up the gun and the uncle just like runs into him or something honestly i really don't know what happened there.The only halfway amusing part about it was the old man listening to his music and seeing them fight behind him! Oh and Peter never found the killer of his uncle(unless i missed that part!) and thats lame he never did since that was the main reason he even made his suit and everything! ****I REALLY HOPE HES NOT IN THE NEW AVENGERS*****","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","bluesman-20","9 August 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man is very clearly a labour of love. The movie carries with it the same air that the early Stan lee Steve ditko stories did. Spider-Man is a tragic hero. His story has been told and retold. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man felt like a labour of love and it was. But James Webb's seems like it's attribute and a labour of love. He's not in awe of spider-man as Raimi is. Webb writes the movie like a updated version of the character as he was written in the 60's. Peter Parker is a sad sack. He's a nerd and yet he's a smart ass He knows what's right and what's wrong. He makes mistakes and yet he's not afraid to stand up for what's right.Webb's story is familiar and different and remarkably fresh.Peter Parker's parent's are scared of something and leave Peter with his aunt May and Uncle Ben. when the Parker's die in a plane crash Peter is raised by his aunt and uncle. but he has questions. when Peter becomes 16 he finds a briefcase belonging to his dad. inside he finds papers relating to his dad's research into genetic splicing. His father's old partner Curtis Connors is still alive and working for Oscorp. His uncle figures out something is wrong. Peter tries to keep this away from them. When he goes to Oscorp to meet Connors he meets his classmate Gwen Stacy. Gwen is a intern at Oscorp and she arranges a meeting with Connors. the meeting with Connors leaves more questions then answers. When Peter goes into a secured room with genetic spliced spiders he is bitten. Peter changes and develops spider like powers he decides to use the powers to show off. this has tragic consequences when Peter lets a criminal go. Peter's Uncle sees the man fleeing and tries to stop him only to be shot. When his uncle dies Peter realizes what his uncle had been trying to tell him all along. with great power comes great responsibility. He creates the uniform and the persona of spider-man and goes out looking for the man who shot his uncle.Peter protects the people of the city as best as he can. during all this he gives Connors his father's research and Connors completes his research. Connors uses it to regrow his lost arm only something goes wrong and he becomes the lizard. Peter's budding romance with Gwen takes a strange turn when her father police captain George Stacy decides to arrest the vigilante known as spider-man. meanwhile the lizard launches a attack against mankind which forces captain Stacy and spider-man into a partnership to stop him.The action is crisp and fast. the acting is spot on. the Dark Knight Rises was the better movie of the two. but this one has enough heart to hold it's own against Batman and the Avengers.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","tavm","30 July 2012","So 10 years after the first Spider-Man that was directed by Sam Raimi and starred Tobey Maguire and 5 years after the third and last by that team were released, we now get a reboot helmed by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield as the web-slinger. This time, we get some additional background concerning Peter Parker's parents when he was a pre-teen before being left in the care of Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). Though we once again have Ben killed by someone Peter neglected to stop earlier when he could've, the part where he initially becomes a wrestler after getting his powers doesn't happen to this version of his origin story this time. Instead of Mary Jane Watson, we get Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) who this time knows Peter's alter ego from the beginning. This is a refreshing change from having previous men behind the masks keep their secret ID from their so-called girlfriends like with Superman and Lois Lane (though it's good to know that's not the case now in the current comics) or Batman and various of his girlfriends. Compared to Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, The Lizard (Ray Ifans) doesn't seem so threatening though he still has a dangerous vibe, just the same. Oh, and for the record, I actually prefer Gwen who's very much of a brave heroine here compared to the often-damsel-in-distress-like fate of Mary Jane. I especially like some of the comic banter between her and Parker and also her father, a police captain played by Dennis Leary. Oh, and the scenes of Spidey swinging from building to building seem more realistic here compared to Raimi's more cartoony-like actions done by CGI. Not surprised to know that actual stunt men were involved. I don't really feel like comparing whether Maguire or Garfield make the better Frendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. I just appreciate the different takes both made in portraying such a legendary superhero. I only have some minor quibbles concerning logic: When Aunt May calls Peter on cell, Parker is still in costume with his mask on, so how can she understands what he says when his voice would be a bit muffled as a result? And how come we didn't see a funeral for Uncle Ben? Okay, otherwise, I did enjoy this reboot of The Amazing Spider-Man, even without seeing it in 3-D. So, yeah, that's a recommendation. P.S. I thought the Stan Lee cameo was another hilarious one...","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","christopher-tucker74","8 July 2012","I saw The Amazing Spiderman 3 days ago now, I did not want to write on something without really taking time to digest what I saw in the theatre. Is this movie perfect? No it is not. However it is very close.As people keep comparing the Rami series to this new one I will tell you why it is a great movie buy itself then go into why it is better overall than the other three.First, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone played their respective roles perfectly. It is like they somehow pulled the characters right out of the comics and brought them to life. And the chemistry between them right on (the subtle way that love creeps up and your not really sure how to act or what to say) Andrew Shows a true Peter Parker and a true Spiderman with all his banter at the bad-guys and himself. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are a true looking Aunt and uncle that have taken the role of parent (I have a friend living in the same circumstance ) and shown what it is really like. The scene in the house when they fight is very touching and makes uncle Ben's' death more hart breaking. Second, showing how peter figures out his powers was okay I didn't really like the football scene with the post bending (that was a little too much even for me) However the skateboarding to show how he has infinitely better balance and agility was a nice touch.Third, The villain was not great CGI and a bit rushed in making, however the fight scenes where very entertaining. Doc Connors was shown as a man divided my moral and personal choices and I would have liked to have seen more between him and Rajit Ratha. Oh and as my son is reading over my shoulder I have to put in he thought it was really funny through the whole movieOkay now for the comparison. People are complaining about No J.J, To bad J.J is not Spiderman nor was he in the Origin of Spiderman he comes in later on when he needs a job.Gwen Stacy is no Mary Jane. Of course not THEY ARE DIFFERENT Gwen is Peters first true love and Mary Jane comes later after her death. Gwen is Peters Intellectual equal and loves Peter for Peter. Mary-Jane Loves Peter cause he is Spiderman Toby vs Andrew - Andrew hands down, Toby is a brooding teen that nobody notices. This is not Peter Parker. Peter is a genus in is own right who tries to do the right thing based on the positive upbringing he had by his aunt and uncle and Andrew portrays this well.Okay and here is the Main reason why I liked this one better. It was not as campy (yes there is campy and then there is Rami campy) Rami's Spiderman was swimming in campy from the really bad Goblin suit to the overall tone of the film and let us not forget the landlord (that was a wast of time to sit through)This Spiderman brings us back to what Spiderman is about, trying to do the right thing but not always doing it right. And finding your way in a world that is very complicated. Are there plot holes and a few things that could be better sure, what movie is perfect (Except The Godfather) Now Spiderman 2 was a great movie but that was cause of the villains in it.","

I had thought andrew would be,as they say, amazing. unfortunately, he was, well, himself!The story is pretty different from the previous spiderman movies. However, the first half is similar to the first half an hour of spiderman 1! yes, it is that boring! Andrew Garfield has done a pretty good job, but his dialogue delivery is kinda sad. I was really impressed by Emma Stone. she looks pretty and has a don't-mess-with-me attitude,which is crucial for her character. I found myself looking at my watch for almost most of the first half. The story, however, picks up in the second half with the advent of the lizard. The 3-D was mediocre, almost useless. So, basically, do not waste time and money at the theatre to watch this movie. you'd rather rent this movie out or download (oops, did i just say that?)!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","liior","7 July 2012","I love superhero movies, they capture our intangible desires, and at times take us to a different world. However, with this horrible remake, I only begged for the movie to end faster. The first 45 minutes of the movie was by far the worst set up I have ever seen; I was falling asleep. The dialogue was BEYOND cheesy, and the performances were mediocre. It felt like the original plan was to make a romance flick and add spiderman as a bonus. The movie is a reboot of the franchise, but why oh why are the events almost identical to the original spiderman! My biggest disappointment, by far, was the lack of epic action scenes, they were all quick and boring. The parallels were weak and super corny: (not a spoiler) there was a scene where Peter forgets to bring eggs home, some time later he brings the eggs and it becomes a magical moment in cinema. Also, the lizard...was extremely unrealistic, almost to the point of laughter. Character development was poor and left me hanging. The plot points were childish, cliché and meaningless. I'm sure some of you have seen the 4 minute trailer they released? That's as good as it gets. The trailer literally had every action scene and included all the interesting shots. It's like I was watching a 2 hour long version of the trailer, what a fail. There was nothing amazing about the amazing spiderman, I defiantly would not recommend wasting your money on it. Instead, just keep rewatching the 4 minute trailer! Much more entertaining!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","RainDogJr","7 July 2012","There's a moment in THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN that is basically the quintessential romantic one involving a superhero: Spidey is about to take his girlfriend (Gwen Stacy) out for a little ride, to show her how New York City looks from the sky. I guess you know what I mean. And when the moment came I thought something like this: if director Marc Webb (who's only other film is the hit 500 DAYS OF SUMMER, which I have yet to watch) wants to take a few minutes for a sort of clichéd romantic scene, well, that's just fine with me since until this point he has given me nothing but a great piece of entertainment. Eventually we don't even get to see pretty much nothing of that romantic kind of scene! So basically I was ready to criticize the film and at the same time forgive its flaws, but in the end that was just unnecessary. Yes, there's really nothing to complaint about this movie; (for instance) I did feel its last act could have been bigger and more exciting but then again, I'm here to forgive the minor flaws. It's actually a very similar case to what we had last year with RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES – a very fine and fun reboot -visually great, with fresh ideas- that keeps you with a big smile (and that leaves you too with it since you just know really nice things will come in the future). During this past week I got to see a newspaper article of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN with the title ""The Unnecessary Spider-Man"". And yesterday when my girlfriend and I were about to watch the film, she asked me that if it was going to show the Spider-Man story from its very beginning again (and she ended loving it, by the way). Judging from yesterday's attendance at the cinema I went (it was a 6 p.m. showing in the opening day, to be exact), many people don't want to rush in order to see the ""same ol' story"" that a decade ago hit the big screen; yes, the attendance was quite low and boy did people missed a whole lot of fun and, of course, the great Lizard! To finish, I'll write some few more thoughts that do nothing other than recommend you checking ""Amazing Spider-Man"" as soon as possible 1) You MUST go for the 3D version of it. And yes, I know that pretty much every film has offered a very disappointing use of this format so that's why I'm so glad to report that this looks simply amazing - I think the only other recent time I loved the 3D thing was in THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN. 2) Arguably a perfect example of a film with forgettable 3D material is THE AVENGERS. And ""Amazing Spider-Man"" is MUCH BETTER than that other big Marvel movie of the year! 3) The first time we get to see Spider-Man, with the actual mask and everything, doing some work has to be one of my favorite scenes in any superhero movie. His attitude is fantastically fun; Andrew Garfield fits the role perfectly, I must say. 4) Not my opinion but a fact: this has the best Stan Lee cameo ever; what a piece of scene actually, fun and imaginative (and a bit violent too!).*Watched it on 06 July, 2012","

He is quite good in the role. Emma Stone can play a wide range of ages and looks quite convincing as a high school student. She is more vulnerable and expressive than Kristen Dunst was in her role.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","brando647","28 January 2013","How many times must Uncle Ben die for our amusement? If ever there was a movie franchise that embodied modern Hollywood's obsession with rebooting and reimagining the past, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is it. It's only been ten years since Sam Raimi brought the web-slinger to the big screen and helped jump-start the comic book movie craze, and it's only been five years since the trilogy came to an embarrassing end with the dud that was SPIDER-MAN 3. Now, rather than pick up where the last films left off and continue on in exciting new directions with a new director, Sony Pictures decided we might as well just start fresh. And that means a reintroduction to Spider-Man's origins, despite the fact that everyone knows by now how Peter Parker came to be New York's web-slinging superhero. I have no problem with rebooting a character franchise and handing the direction over to a new talent, but I don't see why we need to retread old ground. The entire first hour of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN rehashes everything we've already seen in Raimi's SPIDER-MAN in 2002. Except this one is handled a bit differently, which I suppose is why it's supposed to be all right. Parker's parents are more of a central focus in his eventual decision to become Spider-Man and it's his investigation that leads him to his encounter with the radioactive spider in the first place. I'm not sure why it couldn't have been handled in a ten or fifteen minute flashback. When you think about it, Uncle Ben's death was retconned and altered the story with a few flashbacks in SPIDER-MAN 3 and it worked all right without spending an hour going over the whole scenario again.The aggravating part is, once the first hour is done and the groundwork for the Parker parents storyline is laid out, the movie shifts gears into a generic superhero storyline that loses interest. Spider-Man's first challenge in his new role is battling the Lizard. Dr. Connors was introduced in SPIDER-MAN 2 and maintained a presence through the last two Raimi movies, so we knew the Lizard was eventually going to make an appearance. I just wonder if Raimi would've handled him better as a villain. Raimi's villains were always interesting. Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus were near perfect, and even the villains in 3 weren't bad for the extent that Raimi was able to use them when crammed into a single movie. Connors has the appropriate motivation (regrowing his missing arm with cross-species genetics) and the Lizard's arrival on the scene is handled well, but his overall plan is just generic. It's a plan we've seen countless times before in other action films, both superhero and normal. As a result, the movie loses a lot of steam and only becomes interesting again when Spider-Man and the Lizard are battling it out on screen. I enjoyed the movie when I first saw it in theaters, even while recognizing that it had some problems. But each subsequent viewing has weakened it and now I'm mostly bored with the whole thing.My biggest complaint with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is that it doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie. I know the character has been involved in some darker stories but I've always seen the Spider-Man series as a more light-hearted, fun series. Marc Webb's reboot is almost depressing. There's a lot of low lighting and dark colors. Characters always act depressed and angry. Spider-Man fits in a handful of good quips when he's doing his crime-fighting bit but the majority of the movie feels like a downer. Cheer up, people. It's Spider-Man. Leave the gloom for Batman or the Punisher. On a more positive note, the casting was great. Andrew Garfield will make a fine replacement for Tobey Maguire if the filmmakers can lay off the drama and let him have some fun. Emma Stone is a beautiful Gwen Stacy and brings the most levity to the movie. Regardless of how depressing the movie gets, her character's bright eyes and optimistic demeanor comes through. Rhys Ifans was great as Connors, though it's a shame his CG Lizard reminds me of a Goomba from the miserable SUPER MARIO BROS movie. I suppose it's just the lack of a protruding snout. The filmmakers claim they did away with the snout because they couldn't really make him speak with it. That may be so, but at least he would look like a Goomba on steroids. Martin Sheen is wasted as Uncle Ben, and Denis Leary is one of the better characters with Captain Stacy. Really, for the most part, the casting was perfect and should've made for a better movie.THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is mediocre summer fun. If this had debuted in a year with weaker competition, it might've stood out more. But no, sorry, this movie has nothing on Whedon's AVENGERS or Nolan's DARK KNIGHT RISES. As a result, the introductory film in Sony's new Spider-Man series falls pretty flat and I doubt most people will find much more in it than throwaway entertainment before moving on to bigger and better comic book films. It doesn't live up to Raimi's first two Spider-Man films, but at least I can honestly say it was better than SPIDER-MAN 3.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","disgruntledjigglypuff","22 July 2012","First off, this is only my opinion, but really my biggest issue with this film was that it was just kinda boring. About 30 minutes in, I already knew fundamentally everything significant that would transpire in the film. Now that in itself might be a given some might argue, however at that point in the movie, I assumed I would still enjoy it as I expected some spectacular action. Had I been impressed with the fight scenes and jumping around being Spiderman I don't think I would have cared as much about the boring story because it would be redeemed in another aspect. However, the action and special effects in the film were also...kinda...boring. In fact the most spectacular visual moment in the entire film where Spiderman jumps of the top of the tower antenna, and it falls with him as he saves himself was already shown to us in the trailer. I won't go into the fight sequences but for me there was just never really a moment that made my heart race. Lastly the soundtrack was terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible, feeling very out of place in many parts, most notably the fight between the Lizard and Spiderman in the High School. I would normally assume in a scene like that, which is Spiderman and the Lizard's first real physical confrontation, for the music to be more menacing, however it opts for a very happy and victorious theme music. Considering Spiderman doesn't exactly whoop the Lizard there, it's a little out of place. There is however a memorable humorous scene in that altercation.So...this is just kinda boring and not very exiting, as far as movies like this, I personally enjoyed more ""The A Team"",""Red"",""The Avengers"",""Thor"", the first two Spidermans, (Spiderman 3 was terrrrrrible).","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","projectxclan","4 July 2012","This reboot had a different feel then the other spiderman movies. The reason being is that this reboot felt more directed towards adults. This is not to say its not appropriate for younger viewers because its perfectly fine for most youngsters. This spiderman has very little scenes that grab at children rather more of a straight action film with no comedy. Spiderman was much closer to the original hero in this film and i can and did really appreciate that. I found that spiderman 4 would have probably done just as well as The Amazing Spiderman. The movie seemed to drag on much longer then needed with a very slow start. I think the only real thing that would appeal to people is that spiderman is not played by Tobey Maguire which in itself is worth at least a watch.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","xavier-901-692784","4 July 2012","I didn't expect much and though I was surprised in some regards I was highly disappointed in others. I'll first say that I don't mind reboots if they add more to the story, but seriously, over half the film dedicated to how PP becomes Spidey, really? Overall I think the acting, directing, and cinematography were all well done. I blame the screen play on this one being bad, and for those that claim it sticks more to Comic than Sam Raimi's versions I can only ask ""what are you smoking?"" Yes, PP is bitten by a spider and No, there aren't glands that he makes webs with. But that is about as close to the Comic as it really gets. If one were to compare Webb's vision to Raimi's as to which one is closer to the comic, I think fans would pick Raimi's, though I have my misgivings about his vision as well. It was nice seeing Sally Fields in the film, and though I felt she may have appeared to young for the role, she came across as I expected the character to. Denis Leary and Emma Stone make a nice Father/Daughter combination, Andrew Garfield makes a believable replacement for Tobey Maguire, and Martin Sheen made a nice Uncle Ben.If I wasn't so bored with the rehash of Spidey's beginnings this film could have really been something to watch, as it is, save your money or go watch the Avengers. But if you really want to see it, wait about an hour after it starts before checking it out, trust me you won't miss anything we haven't already seen.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","griffolyon12","3 July 2012","We all know the story, teenager is bit by a scientifically altered spider, gets spider powers and becomes Spider-Man, what we didn't know was his past before he became the Spider-Man. To compare The Amazing Spider-Man to the original Sam Raimi Spider-Man, is like comparing apples to oranges. One is more character centric, where as the other is more light-hearted and melodramatic in the comic book style. The Amazing Spider-Man is a wonderful movie because it does not feel like a retread of the Sam Raimi original. Director Marc Webb and the rest of his crew have manufactured a Spider-Man movie that does not try to compete with what has been done before, but rather focuses on lesser known aspects of the character Peter Parker and makes the film a character piece rather than a large scale mosaic.It's evident when we are not treated to a shot of the New York City skyline till nearly ten minutes into the movie, that this Spider-Man isn't looking to impress with scope or scale. Rather the first thing we see is the tale of how Peter Parker's parents left him as a child with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, to never return for him. This is the greatest and most unique aspect of the film. The Amazing Spider-Man is up there with some of the great comic book story arcs, because it delves deeper into Peter's past than perhaps even some of the comics have done. Actor Andrew Garfield portrays Peter as a kid with a chip on his shoulder, having been abandoned by his own father he looks for fatherly connections with everyone from Uncle Ben to Dr. Curtis Connors, all the way to his girlfriend's dad, Captain Stacy. Garfield is the heart- and-soul of this movie, and he portrays Peter as an outcast rather than as a geek with no friends, and it works. He understands the character, perhaps even more so than Tobey Maguire did.While the story does retread some of the origin aspects from the Sam Raimi movie, the movie is constantly replaying them so differently, it never really crosses the mind that they are portraying some of the same events. The strength to this lies in the great screenplay from James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sergeant, and Harry Potter-alum Steve Kloves. The screenplay ties up Spidey's origin with Peter trying to uncover the mystery of his dad's old briefcase, which leads him to discover the source of his webbing, and his powers, but it also gives the movie a different through line than any other Spider-Man movie. We see Peter get bit by the spider, we see him discover his powers, we even see the unfortunate tragedy that leads him to donning tights, but what we see is a more realistic approach to how these things play out. The Raimi film is more operatic, focusing on the emotion of the moments, rather this film focuses more on how these moments work as transitioning points in the maturation of Peter Parker and coming to accept his parents' disappearance. Everything flows and transpires with an action-reaction style. Peter does something, which causes this to happen, or this happens affecting Peter, and this keeps the story always focused on him.As cheesy as it sound, The Amazing Spider-Man is amazing. The fight scenes between Spidey and his bad guy the Lizard are top notch, with some exceptional CG-camera work that creates the sense of being a fly on the wall zooming and flipping over the fight as Spidey zips around. Emma Stone is likable as love interest Gwen Stacy, and Martin Sheen is a terrific Uncle Ben, with that exceptionally lovable twinkle in his eye. Not to mention the film is well directed, joining the ranks of other Indie-Blockbusters over the past decade (Blockbusters with an Independent film aesthetic because they were made by an Indie director, this case Marc Webb). There are many directorial signatures in Webb's work that can be seen in both his first film, (500) Days of Summer, and this one. In particular the music video-like montage when Peter is messing around with his powers and skateboarding, it harks back to Webb's video roots and the multiple montage, music video-like sequences in (500) Days of Summer. To cap it off, the musical score from James Horner is heroic and beautiful at all of the right moments, being a worthy successor to the brilliant Danny Elfman music from the original movies.I loved this movie, it was fun, heroic, deep, and emotional. There are so many great scenes, one of my personal favorites being when Spider-Man saves a child from a burning car hanging off a bridge, or the finale when an injured Spidey gets aid from New Yorkers themselves. These scenes just symbolize what is so special about the character of Spider- Man. He has wit, but he's also got a huge heart and will almost always try to do the right thing, even if it nearly kills him in the process. The old Parker luck is with this one.I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 10 out of 10!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","divncom","4 July 2012","Why did we need a Spiderman reboot when there are so many other ideas that could have been brought to life with the same budget, cast and direction?The singular answer is that the studio sees this and every other huge budget comic book extravaganza as an investment. A huge one. When you're monkeying around with an investment on this scale, you're conservative: You make just enough semi-relevant changes to justify the films existence. That just doesn't cut it though for such an iconic character. You must either accept or reject the notion that, in the end, all you will be receiving with this title is a slightly different take on the same old story. Don't walk into the theater expecting reinvention of the wheel.If you can completely embrace the notion that you will be force fed the same formulaic origins story from start to finish with pin point precision in playing identical emotional notes to its forbearer - you won't be severely disappointed. There just isn't a rational reason to have to lower your expectation, though. The primary reason I find this Spiderman unacceptable isn't that the character is boring. It isn't that the actors are bad - they aren't. Garfield is a particularly good Spiderman; better than Maguire. The main reason this film is unacceptable is that the bar has moved drastically. Hardcore comic book fans are packing the theaters with higher expectations than ever; the genre has evolved so to speak. With titles like X-Men first Class, The Avengers and The Dark Knight films in the same universe - this Spidey simply doesn't have the same impact as the ten years old predecessor. In this new, evolved universe fans are more savvy. We now expect the thrill rating to ratchet up higher; the contours to be more dynamic. We expect to see ensembles; teams and entire casts of superhero's working together in the same universe ... the Marvel movie universe. We expect a degree of suspense. This film has no suspense- of course not; not when we've seen it already before it begins. What we have here is something that might have been great 10 years ago. It's not great now; it's profoundly average in the context of the other comic book films surrounding it. If it's at all legally possible, I would sincerely hope that Spiderman exist (in a clearly defined and visible way) within the Marvel Universe that has so rapidly expanded ... leaving the web slinger in his own niche only makes him that much more insignificant. My hope is that somehow Spidey can be incorporated into the Marvel Universe in much the same way the Avengers worked; or in much the same way X-Men first class worked. Adding some comic book buddies will take some of the weight off of Garfield's shoulders ... he's a good Spiderman but I don't feel he can carry the load alone. Until then, it's the same old story - and your friendly neighborhood Spiderman is awfully lonely relying on the same old schtick.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Pjtaylor-96-138044","14 February 2018","'The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)' promises the 'untold story' and yet gives us largely the same origin as before, oddly borrowing some specific elements that surely wouldn't be included if they hadn't been in the '2002' incarnation, while removing most of the connecting tissue between the events and thus severely reducing their impact. Peter Parker - here, a skate-boarding hipster whose idea of awkward is to talk too much but always manage to say the right thing - is bitten by a random spider, that isn't set up as being genetically modified, while visiting a lab. Within a couple of scenes, he is crawling about the walls with ease. It's almost like they couldn't be bothered to retell the origin story and so decided to rush through it, making the entire endeavour rather redundant as it's almost assumed you've seen the prior trilogy anyway. Even when the web-slinging action starts - which is well-done for the most part and compounded by some believable visual effects - you just don't care. Plus, it doesn't help that the film is painfully generic, too, both in terms of the story-telling and the directing. At with least Raimi's trilogy, even when it was at its worst it was still interesting. It's worth noting, though, that Garfield and Stone are notably good in their roles. Their genuine chemistry elevates the movie, which is at its best whenever they share a scene. 5/10.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","donxavier","11 July 2012","First, let me just say that I liked the Raimi trilogy...yes, even Spiderman 3 was fairly good. Did it have some problems, oh yes, but mostly enjoyable.Anyway, when it was announced that Spidey was getting a reboot I, like many other people, thought why? Why is it necessary to throw out everything just because you're changing lead actors and director. Could've just stuck with the Peter and MJ relationship but with different actors and kept the current film continuity. Sure it would've raised some eyebrows but there would've been far less uproar than a complete retelling of the story.Where was I? Oh yes, this new Spiderman movie. While it's not terrible, it's FAR from great. It just has not heart to it, no drive. Everything in this story is so by-the-numbers that you can see every plot turn a mile away. That would be fine, even somewhat forgivable, if this movie was fun but that's not the case.Nearly every actor in this film seems miscast. From the generic guy playing Flash to Sally Field, right up to Andrew Garfield as the man in tights himself. No one seems to have a real handle on the character they're playing so they resort to archtypes. Emma Stone, as a prime example, slips into the same well worn shoes of the character she seems to play, with minor variations, in every movie: sardonic girl who wears her inner girl power on her sleeve. A little of that goes a long way.The effects in this movie were mildly disappointing for a big summer blockbuster especially Spiderman's web swinging and the Lizard. One of the ""improvements"" for this reboot has been the use of as much live action web swinging for Spiderman as possible, to make it look more life like. They must have realized early on that this was not the way to go because most of Spidey's web swinging is done at night, which I'm assuming is to hide the ridiculousness of a man swinging around in a harness.Then there is the Lizard. What a visual train wreck of a villain he is. With all the money that Sony sank into this ""reboot"" there wasn't enough to hire a better CGI effects team? The Lizard looks like he's straight from one of the Syfy Channel's ""Dinocrock vs Jurassic Lizard"" B grade films. OK, maybe not THAT bad but certainly not at the level one would expect from a film like this.This is getting long so I'm going to sum up my remaining criticisms of this film: 1) Everyone in New York knows that Peter Parker is Spiderman!!! I lost count of how many times he gave himself away, either by taking off his mask or displaying his superhuman abilities while in his street clothes.2) Guess when you're a parent of a future superhero, or the girl he likes, your life is pretty much over. Peter's parents vanish, Uncle Ben dies, Gwen's father dies...good lord! You're next May Parker.3) Sally Field and Martin Sheen were not believable as a couple. If it wasn't for the fact that they're named Uncle Ben and May Parker, I never would've believed they were married.Whew, there I've said my piece...now I'm going home. G'dnight!!","

The new Peter Parker is 10 x's a better actor than Tobey Maguire. I enjoyed the Avengers movie but the Amazing Spiderman's plot works much better to me and the story-line just seems to pulls you along effortlessly and keeps you intrigued and interested at the same time. It's the great blend of story/plot, good acting, and action-adventure and fight scenes with the bad guy. As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the better ones. I think it's most definitely better than the last two Spiderman movies and probably better than the first one but not by too much.It is worth the price of admission to watch this movie and it would be a great movie to take your kids since their isn't anything crazy happening in this movie.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","filipemanuelneto","8 November 2019","Following in the wake of the ream of comic heroe movies that DC and Marvel have been promoting, this film is just one more, and addresses, as it has been done before in the cinema, the iconic figure of Spider-Man, a one of the most remarkable and famous cartoon heroes ever. He has originated, at least, one trilogy (around 2000) and has now been recycled to make a few more movies, and a few million dollars in profits.This movie, like many others, tells how teenager Peter Parker became Spider-Man, with all the moral and psychological conflicts associated with such a radical transformation. However, we have seen this so many times that it was difficult to show anything substantially better without changing the character's story, which would be sacrilegious. So the movie just shows what we already know, selects a powerful villain from the long list of enemies the character has accumulated over decades of comics, and gives us the decisive confrontation between them.Andrew Garfield is a decent Peter Parker, but I confess he hasn't always convinced me. He has some annoying face movements, but he does what he needs to do. Emma Stone looked a lot better to me, but this wasn't the movie for her to shine. So she just made a good romantic match, having a good chemistry with Garfield. Rhys Ifans is equally good as a villain. Martin Sheen and Denis Leary also did well.The film is directed by Marc Webb, who seems to have done a decent job. The problem is that he didn't bet as much as he should on creating a good story and developing characters and the work of the actors. The concern was, from the beginning, CGI and visual and sound effects. And, in fact, on this issue, the movie is excellent. It's a visual show from start to finish, with sweeping New York views, great costumes and photography and immense camera movement, which gives a feeling of speed and agility to Spider-Man, who flies and jumps like never before. Soundtrack is also excellent, as epic as you'd expect in such a movie.I think the movie loses a little compared to other movies with other characters. It is not a movie that stays in memory, or can be said to be grand or excellent. Good dialogues are missing, a handful of more complex and developed characters, a more interesting and less trite story. It's a good and entertaining movie, has good production values, good actors and is visually spectacular, but that's basically it.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Boba_Fett1138","11 July 2012","First of all, it was of course totally unnecessary to reboot the series again already. They might as well could had simply made this movie as a ""Spider-Man 4"", that way we wouldn't had to sit to another origin story, that besides isn't getting told as a very good or interesting one.And that is the foremost problem of the movie; I just couldn't really ever get into it. It didn't always had a very pleasant flow to it and things didn't always progressed and developed very natural. Things just happen and you have to take a lot of things simply for granted.There were plenty of things that bothered me about its story and storytelling. I for instance never bought into the whole romance between Peter Paker and Gwen Stacy. I have no idea what made them fall in love and what made their love so powerful or unique. Like I said before, it just happens but there is never really any notable chemistry or anything about it that makes you root for their love or make you feel and believe that these two persons belong together.The movie also does quite a poor job with all of the character's motivations. There is no good reason for Peter Parker to develop and put on a suit and swing through the city, trying to catch criminals. There also really wasn't a good enough reason for Dr. Curt Connors to turn into a super-villain and there was even less reason for him and Spider-Man to become enemies. With this I mean that their story lines aren't really interconnected good enough with each other and Spider-Man so easily could had decided not to get involved and not to get his life at risk, since it wasn't like he was being an established superhero in the city already, who everybody relied on. Another reason why this movie would had been simply better, had it been done as a ""Spider-Man 4"", instead of as a fresh start to the movie series again.It's a shame this movie failed to make any emotional impact on me since this obviously was the approach the film-makers were going for. A more personal and dramatic Spider-Man but the movie just really didn't had the right script for that. Even the whole uncle Ben storyline totally left me cold this time and so did the relationship between Peter Parker and aunt May, which always is an important aspect about the Spider-Man franchise, in my opinion.And for goodness sake, stop recycling your own music so much, James Horner!It of course remains a far from bad movie but there is nothing about it that stands out or make this a memorable or unique movie within its genre. It does absolutely nothing new but it of course does still provide some entertainment. I still did wish there was some more action in it at times though. But Peter Parker doesn't really become Spider-Man until halfway through and Dr. Curt Connors becomes the Lizard even much later on in the movie. It therefore takes a while for the action to truly kick in but when it does, it's all quite and fun to watch but overall the movie remains underwhelming, in about every way imaginable.Also can't say that I was very fond of the casting. Andrew Garfield never gave me either a Peter Parker or Spider-Man vibe. He feels miscast in my opinion and I definitely won't mind at all if he gets replaced with another actors for the next movie. As a matter of fact, I doubt I will even notice it, since he's so incredibly unremarkable in his role and I doubt I will recognize him on street, even now, when I have just finished watching this movie. He isn't being very likable or charismatic enough in his role.It really doesn't do or bring anything fresh, original or great to the series. Weak as a reboot and very mediocre as just another modern superhero movie.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Cineanalyst","29 September 2020","I wonder had the director's name not been Webb, would life had led him to directing a Spider-Man movie....Anyways, Funny that stealing is central to the story in ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" from Peter Parker assuming someone else's identity to burglarize a lab, to his complicity in a convenience store theft, or someone attempting to steal his father's work in the opening sequence only for Peter to later pass that work off as his own. It's funny because the movie is largely a lazy retread of the same notes hit upon in the last Spider-Man series, which had only wrapped up with its third installment half a decade ago when this was released. The major exception preventing me from ranking this lower is that there's improvement in the camerawork.As in ""Spider-Man"" (2002), the superhero saves some people while fighting a green villain on a bridge. Again, Parker has a personal connection with that man-turned-monster, both of whom have at least one or two scenes where they seem to be insanely talking to themselves in their mind. Despite a protagonist who is a photographer and swings between skyscrapers, the camerawork for both movies is largely disappointingly rudimentary. The reboot's ending is actually an exception, as the digital camera finally starts flying through the air along with Spidey. Parker's picture taking, however, hardly figures into this version at all--at least not in any interesting way. His newfound fascination with skateboarding and, evidently, hair products receive more attention. The movie itself is photographically darker, which may help to conceal some of the CGI, such as of the talking lizard, that already seems somewhat dated, or maybe it's just another pastiche of ""The Dark Knight"" (2008).Another scene here seems as though it were a direct quotation of the 2002 picture, where Spidey goes down an eerily familiar-looking alley (stylistically, that is) to save a woman from being harassed by men. In the 2002 version, this was actually a well-made scene, as far as tropes of a hero rescuing a damsel from a rape attempt go, culminating in that famous upside-down kiss. Not here. Another thing I don't like in this iteration is that Spidey's web slinging is a mechanical invention rather than a natural growth of the mutant spider. That made for a perverse puberty metaphor regarding the teenage superhero when you think about it. Andrew Garfield's character, on the other hand, besides stealing, also has sticky fingers for grabbing women--ripping the blouse off a subway passenger and, later, pulling and twirling Emma Stone in by the hip for a rooftop smooch.The Uncle Ben stuff is so familiar, I guess, that it seems as though the editors tried to rush through it, which kind of reminds me of a similar treatment of Bruce Wayne's parents in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Neither works well. They also cast Sally Field as Aunt May and, then, give her nothing to work with. And the construction crew plotline and music for the finale are hokey. Indeed, a lot of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" merely feels perfunctory. Not a movie made because anyone had a novel interpretation of the familiar comic-book series, but rather to satisfy Sony's demand to keep vomiting out Spidey movies every few years so as to keep their rights to the franchise so that they can keep vomiting. It's a vicious circle. The sequel turned out so bad they had to make a deal with Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe to keep their Spidey from being stolen. I don't get why this first one did fairly well with critics and audiences. Dennis Leary's police captain's hint of a Spider-Man v Godzilla flick sounds, well, if not better, than at least more ridiculously amusing to me than this popcorn fodder.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Bored_Dragon","9 August 2019","It wasn't very clear to me why would anyone make new Spider-man trilogy just five years after the previous one ended (quite poorly), but as I decided to see all Marvel flicks... I read IMDb reviews and cross myself. Tastes differ, that's a fact, but to rate this movie from one to three out of ten is nothing but spite. There is no way that anyone seriously thinks that this film is unwatchable crap, except of course if they look on the whole superhero genre that way, in which case it would be fairer not to evaluate it at all.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a reboot of the Spider-man franchise with a slightly different approach than Raimi's. The story is basically the same, but a bunch of details is changed. In some respects, this version is more faithful to the comic book, and in every respect I liked it better. The most obvious and critical difference is the characterization of Peter Parker, who, unlike the pathetic weenie from Raimi's version, is now a rebellious teenager with whom it is easier to identify. Also, Garfield is much more likable than Maguire, though he does not exactly fit the role of a nerd. The film has a great pace and balance of drama, action, and humor just to my liking. A little laughter, a little sitting on the edge of a chair, and two hours flew by. The only advantage of Raimi's version, very subjective though, is that, to me, Kirsten Dunst is much more attractive than Emma Stone, and the chemistry between her and Tobey is stronger than between Emma and Garfield.8,5/10","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","zkonedog","9 March 2017","After the incredible success of the ""original"" Spiderman series (now known as ""the Tobey Maguire one""), director Sam Raimi & Sony could not agree on a fourth addition to that franchise. As such, Sony decided to dump Raimi and reboot the series again despite the very short time frame. While this movie will almost certainly rack up huge profits at the box office over the summer months, its utter lack of heart and anything original/interesting will eventually become known and be its undoing.For a basic plot summary, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" reboots the Spiderman franchise with Andrew Garfield as the title character and Emma Stone as Peter Parker's teenage crush Gwen Stacy. Also along for the ride is Rhys Ifans as a scientist working to perfect inter-species DNA mixing, which of course sets the stage for the battle between Spidey & The Lizard.There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is actually just easier to go over them in list form:-The main problem is that the direction from Marc Webb and thus the overall tone of the film is just wrong. It tries to be a high school drama, action/adventure romp, ""Dark Knight""-style hero film, and even a part goofy comedy all at once. It fails at all of these aspects because it just doesn't establish an identity. Whereas ""Dark Knight"" works because it is so visceral and the original Spidey flicks work because they are more playful and light (like reading a comic book versus a graphic novel), this one falls squarely in the ""muddled middle"". -Andrew Garfield is a great actor, but his character is written so wildly inconsistent that it is literally laughable at times. There is no believe character progression or development whatsoever. One minute he is a goofy teenager, the next a brooding soul, and the next a punk, changing between the three for seemingly no reason at all. -This is too soon after ""Spiderman 3"", plain and simple. The first 45 minutes are so get tedious because, well, we already saw this stuff not so long ago. I can completely see what Sony was trying to do, but it just should not have been done. As previously mentioned, it will make a ton of money (at least at first) but inevitably suck the life out of the franchise. -Finally, there are also some scenes in this film that will almost make you laugh out loud as to their ridiculousness. Maguire's Spidey always teetered on the edge of dramatic/campy, but this time it descends into stupidity. You never know what you are going to get from scene to scene.The only bright point of the experience: Emma Stone's performance as Gwen. Despite the fact that she is terribly miscast as a high school student, Stone gives her character at least some charm. It is more than can be said for anything or anybody else in the movie.Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was one of the biggest letdowns I have ever experienced in the cinema. For me, it is closer to 1.5 stars on the ranking scale. In a Hollywood era where superhero movies rule right now, this one is a complete and utter dud.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","DarthVoorhees","22 July 2012","'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a mess of a movie. The classic hero formula gets old really fast. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' doesn't give a damn about any of it's characters or what motivates them. It wants money and that's all there is to it. Sony thinks America's movie going public is composed of a bunch of ignoramuses who will buy anything they shove Spider-Man's name onto. Sam Raimi made a trilogy of goofy films but at their best moments they defined Spider- Man and what he wanted to be. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is too dark and self important to work. Sony failed to understand the character and what drove him. I can imagine the writing of this script tried very hard to mimic 'The Dark Knight'. Spider-Man isn't meant to be this dark though. Here Spider-Man is more like Norman Bates than he is a superhero. 'The Amazing Spider- Man' has no idea what it is to be an adolescent trying to find their place in the world which I imagine was their intent in the rebooting of the franchise. What we get is a very flat hero who thinks he is well developed.""With great power comes great responsibility""Cheesy? Sure but it has a nice ring to it. Stan Lee in his own nerdy form of eloquence defined what drives every super hero. If you have the power to do good than you should. I am not a fan of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films but at least they had a character with a motivation. It's a simple and cliché motivation but with proper weight put on it, it is brilliant. Spider-Man has gone into darker themes as a comic but never has he become a self-important cry baby as he is here. There is no origin or making of a hero here. The entire film is built around Peter's parents and some terrible secret they took with them to the graves. Fine but at least take us along on a journey with Peter. The film is forced to remind us about this with star Andrew Garfield going into little angsty crybaby fits. Uncle Ben which has served as the primary motivation for Spider- Man in the past is reduced to next to nothing here. Martin Sheen is good here but Garfield and this script give nothing back to the character. His death becomes mere exposition because we are meant to think something deeper and more sinister lies beneath. I sincerely doubt Sony has taken any sort of comic book into mind in the plotting of this would be franchise. I predict that sequels will drag along without the secret being answered and they will just having Peter be depressed about it. I doubt Sony even knows what the secret is. And so how does this effect the film? We have a miserable selfish hero that only cares about himself. This is the furthest opposite of all that Spider-Man was built upon. If Spider-Man ever got depressed it was because he was limited in the amount of people he could save. Spider- Man has great power here but it is self serving power. If I were Stan Lee I'd be ashamed that they did this to my character.There isn't really anything positive to say about any other area of the film. It's foundations are faulty and so nothing can really be built upon them. I imagine Denis Leary, Emma Stone, and Rhys Ifans could all be cast in the same roles in an excellent Spider-Man film.Rhys Ifans is actually kind of good as Curt Conners but the Lizard CGI is about as fake as anything you would see in a 'Transformers' film and so his performance is wasted.The problem is because the origin and mythology is so distorted and unlikeable that I don't care about anyone else. It's just an ordinary summer film really which needs a good story to become extraordinary. We see the same old action we always see. Raimi was better at web swinging action sequences because he embraced the cartoonish nature of them while keeping the integrity of the character. See Spider-Man 2. It's not a great film and it has it's share of goof ball moments but it has a defined hero.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","martinpersson97","20 October 2023","Just a few years after Sam Raimi's trilogy, the last film which is often deemed rather disappointing - it was decided to reboot Spider-Man.Is it better than Spider-Man 3? I would say so, but it still doesnt' feel that good, nor necessary.The director Marc Webb, who has an otherwise pretty solid track record, tries to emulate the darker, more serious tone of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy a bit, which is interesting, but feels somewhat stale here. Gone is the fun from the first two Sam Raimi films, and everything feels rather underdeveloped and uninteresting.The actors, many of them pretty big and iconic names, do a fine job, but don't work that well with a pretty subpar script. There is also lots of questionable and a little too obvious CGI throughout the film.Overall, it is pretty decent in its own way, but I would still call it a pretty bad film, even if it beats Spider-Man 3, of course.There was another sequel before this trilogy was cancelled, but I do not intend to watch it personally. This film didn't peak my interest a whole lot.Andrew Garfield got another shot in the role later on in the MCU, and rectified his story a bit, which is fun of course.Overall, I can't really say I recommend this. But it is okay, I guess.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Wscott3322","4 July 2012","The main actor for SM was much better than Toby. They girlfriend was a lot better looking than Kirston Durnst. But the fact of the matter was that the script was terrible. There were a few bit and pieces of action but the main story was a love story or no story. I would recommend you go see the Avengers again or wait for Batman. Or just rent it. I almost fell asleep. I have most likely seen 90% of every movie ever made and am a huge fan of superhero films. Saw the Avengers 3x in one week. This film is a total yawner. The main villain is just hard to believe and was poorly cast. Special effects were OK, sound was OK. I was forced due to times to see it in 3D which I hate. But the 3D was actually decent for this film.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","matthewssilverhammer","17 July 2017","There is no question that this movie is bad. The dramatic skateboarding. The laughable post-bite freak-outs. The obnoxious seriousness that pervades any fun that could be had. However, the worst part is just how unnecessary it all is. If any product ever screamed of money-grabbing, this is it. The times the movie works directly correlates to when Stone and Garfield are sharing the screen, or when he's fully suited.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Ryan_MYeah","23 October 2012","Most would probably look to Chris Nolan's intense and morally complex The Dark Knight as the pinnacle of the superhero genre (which it arguably is), but if you ask me, the Spiderman films from quirky director Sam Raimi were what validated the genre in the first place. With an expert mix of sincere emotion, stylistic action, and just the right amount of Raimi's trademark goofiness, Spiderman and its superior sequel saw the genre at its most entertaining. After the disastrously disappointing Spiderman 3, it seemed like an odd move for Sony to reboot the series so quickly. But what the newly released The Amazing Spiderman may lack in the same creativity, it makes up for with heart and scale.Peter Parker is your not quite average high school kid. He struggles with bullies at school, his feelings for Gwen Stacy, and trying to figure out the secrets of his deceased father, a former scientist at Oscorp who worked with Dr. Curt Connors, a man trying to invent a serum that would restore the amputated limbs of many people, including his own arm. Searching for answers, he is bitten by a genetic spider that gives him superhuman abilities, and through a series of events that take place, Spiderman, as we now know him, is born... again. But it isn't long after Peter takes up his job as the masked webslinger that complications arise, becoming sought after by the NYPD as a vigilante, and facing off with Connors, whose serum has transformed him into the hideous Lizard.Look, it's hard not to compare this to Raimi's first Spiderman film, especially when it revisits a lot of the same plot points, but it still provides its own uniqueness on the hero. Fun, funny, and superbly realized, The Amazing Spiderman also drags occasionally, and leaves several loose ends that may frustrate some viewers, or maybe just leave them scratching their heads. Action is also surprisingly spread out in light doses, but thankfully so in how it lets the story flow so smoothly. Marc Webb, director of the sleeper hit (500) Days of Summer, wouldn't appear to be the obvious choice for this movie, but you really begin to understand why he was chosen as the movie moves along.At the core of this movie is the irresistible love story between Peter and Gwen, delicately played by Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. This movie was what apparently led to the two stars becoming a real life couple, and it's easy to see why, because they share chemistry that makes the love feel genuine. The acting is uniformly good, from Garfield and Stone especially. The supporting performances from Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, and Martin Sheen are excellent, although I can't help but wish they'd have given Leary and his character George Stacy, Gwen's father and a captain of the NYPD, more on screen time.Technically, the film is excellent. The editing, though occasionally sluggish, is still carefully handled by Alan Bell and Pietro Scalia. The effects supervised by Jerome Chen are pretty stellar, and Shannon Mills and Addison Teague provide creative and robust sound effects. Prepare to be blown away by composer James Horner, who gives us his greatest musical score since that of Titanic, a thematically rich and proudly old fashioned throwback complete with a heroic, and memorable main theme. It truly is spectacular, barely surpassing Danny Elfman's music for Raimi's movies in the process.In short, though it's really not something I'm encouraging anyone to look too deeply into, did we really need this movie so soon after the originals? Maybe we didn't, but for what it is, you can't fault it for not quite living up to high expectations when it still is pretty entertaining. Not as amazing as the title may imply, but close enough.**** / *****","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","scoup","10 July 2012","I'm not sure how anyone rated this movie over a 7. Maybe someone who who hasn't seen another Spiderman movie or a teenager could think it's great, but rest assured it is NOT.Green Lantern was bad and I gave it a 6, but I'm giving this a 5 because it's a reboot and did not need to be done. There are plenty of good writers so there is no excuse for the poor script.Spiderman was boring and unoriginal. My mind wondered throughout the movie due to lack of empathy for the characters and plodding pace. I was more interested in my own thoughts of imagining how Christopher Nolan would have done the reboot and how much better it would have been - what a pity.Here are my gripes: Costume was bad (at least Green Lantern had a cool suit); subway scene was dumb - Parker immediately gets powers with no real bodily effects and putting a cold beer bottle with weight on his forehead doesn't awaken him, but a DROP of beer jolts him to the subway roof - laughable, cue my eye-roll - and where was the Spidey sense????;Uncle Ben's death was not as emotionally affective as it should have been. Aunt May just seemed off - 2002 Aunt May all the way; Dr. Connors was mishandled and boring - i do not buy that his motivation for trying the serum is the threat of being fired; he lost his arm and wants to be whole; Denis Leary - underutilized and needed more screen time; bad move killing him off because he was the one person I would have liked to see in a sequel; Mask - why is he always taking his mask off??? This seems out of character and reckless. Any retard knows to keep your identity a secret - and Parker is a genius, right? He can build web slingers and solve the formula problem that dozens of scientists have been working on, but he can't make a mask to keep on his face?; Bridge rescue - clichéd and no dramatic tension (glad to see Jim Halsey and was thankful for the distraction of remembering how much I liked The Hitcher. Five minutes of that movie had more drama and tension than the entire Spiderman movie); Crane scene - contrived, forced and just ridiculous; love story - not even remotely developed; Parker does not go to the funeral when her dad dies??? The man who let him go??? No way. They did not look like teenagers - too old; $10 minimum spend to take a penny - pathetic script writing which should have been cut; Hype about movie being darker and Parker wittier - epic fail. They should have gotten a script doctor from Iron Man to give it look.Spider Bite - his father's research work is the basis for the genetically mutated spiders, but Parker does internet search for information????????? Not look at his father's work??? Because when I look for cutting edge research information on secretive work worth millions of dollars which gives me superhuman powers, I go right to the internet...and ignore the work that cost my father his life;Music - atrocious. You know it's bad when you you are actually thinking about it - normally music should be seamless in the movie and on all too rare occasions does the viewer encounter beautiful scores. I had to look it up and James Horner who won awards for Titanic and Avatar is listed. I guess you can't win them all, mediocrity would have been a step up; CGI - ehhh; CGI Hulk in Avengers was good, nothing stood out here; Gwen in closet - spray can of fire to scare off mutant lizard with regenerative powers and superhuman strength??? Conclusion: Disappointing movie that should have been better from a reviewer who is not a fan boy of Raimi. Examples of movies that did it better are Batman, Iron Man and Hulk (Norton, but there is room for improvement here). Clearly there will be a sequel because the studio is making a lot of money - they need to regroup and produce something better.I am anxiously awaiting the Hulk reboot with Ruffalo and hope it is better than The Amazing Spiderman.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","fernandoschiavi","10 April 2020","It is undeniable that Spider-Man is one of the most popular and beloved Marvel world. Since its emergence in the early 60s, its creators, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, with the idealized characteristics make more humanized among other comics characters of the same era. With the various impasses, Columbia Pictures chose to dispense with Sam Raimi and decided to reboot the franchise from the beginning, showing Peter Parker in high school, being bitten and learning to be Spider-Man. The studio called Marc Webb and the screenplay was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves, based on a story by James Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt had the thriller Zodiac (2007) directed by David Fincher as their most outstanding work so far, Sargent has had experience in the Spider-Man franchise was scripted as the second and third films of the hero, and Kloves was responsible for almost all adaptations of the Harry Potter books to theaters. In this new script would be the villain Dr. Kurt Connors / Lizard, who was present in the three previous films, played by Dylan Baker, but always as an extra. Marc Webb also wanted to give greater prominence to the story involving the parents of Peter Parker. Finally, it would be the first film involving the hero also released in 3D format.Andrew Garfield - who had been prominent in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) Terry Gilliam and The Social Network (2010) David Fincher - was chosen as the new Peter Parker / Spider-Man after being released that several actors were quoted to interpret the character. Josh Hutcherson, Jamie Bell, Michael Angarano, Alden Ehrenreich, Aaron Johnson, Logan Lerman and Anton Yelchin were some of these names. Here it is for the role of Gwen Stacy were listed Mia Wasikowska, Teresa Palmer, Diana Agron, Emma Roberts, Imogen Poots, Lindsay Lohan, Lily Collins, Ophelia Lovibond, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Georgina Haig and Dominique McElligott Hilary Duff, but in the end was Emma Stone, one of the highlights in recent years in Hollywood in films like Zombieland (2009), Easy A (2010) and Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011), which was chosen to live The First girlfriend of Peter Parker. Here it is to live the villainous Lizard, Rhys Ifans British overcame the likes of Michael Fassbender and Christoph Waltz, winning the role. With a generous budget of about $ 220 million, filming finally began in December 2010 in various locations in the state of California, as Immanuel Presbyterian Church, St. John Bosco High School, and Taft High School in Los Angeles, and Also in New York.Marc Webb made some changes in his version, trying to make Peter Parker more realistic, we can say that this film uses assumptions similar to what Christopher Nolan did his hundred Batman Begins. The saga of a teenage Peter Parker more (even if you compare with Tobey Maguire who completed 37 years at the time of release of this film) is much more conducive to further exploration humorous superhero school and uncles home. Beyond the humor, you can also highlight the mood changes relevant to age, rage and conflicts arising from their newfound identity.The producers clearly more humanized the character, and the proof is that Peter Parker has more prominence than Spider-Man. Webb wanted to drive something more grounded in reality and it affecting the emotion of the scenes, the physical action and the clothes. Hence we have a deepening relationships of the characters, further exploration of the past of Peter with his parents, and a more paupável that it develops its technological apparatus, behaves, and is inspired to produce their clothing hero. The paths traced are less based on Steve Ditko world and probably closer visually and more influenced by the Ultimate universe, but also quite a world of our own creation. The director also made other changes in this new version, like the fact that Peter skating and taking the traditional glasses Peter Parker in many scenes, giving contact lenses to the boy. In fact, since the character was created by Stan Lee, moved very concept of the ""nerd"" in recent decades, and these changes are incorporated in the current reality and understandable. The most important story was kept as Peter being a kid excluded and lonely by choice, being hard to get close to him because it has been abandoned and did not want that to happen again.Another change is a greater emphasis on the genius of Peter. In this film we see their direct participation in the creation of the formula that gives the appearance of villain - what planet infect an entire city making them become reptiles - in addition to equipment scattered his room as the lock on the door, and especially in creating the web-slinger as soon as he decides to fight crime with the alter-ego Spider-Man - though here he uses material from Oscorp to enable your weapon / means of locomotion. Many fans criticized the release of Sam Raimi in which the webs leave directly from their hands as a result of genetic change occurred by the bite of the spider, as here, the webs are created by a device invented by Peter, following the history of comics and highlighting the genius of the young. Another most striking feature is the sense of humor of Spider-Man, which as in the comics, every time he encountered his enemies and villains possessed a mood much more acidic and fun. Bringing to the present day, it is as if Peter was the anonymity of the internet into that uniform and could be more sarcastic.Known peo photography work on director Michael Bay movies like The Rock (1995), Armageddon (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001) and other blockbusters like Night at the Museum 2 (2009) and The Green Hornet (2011) John Schwartzman probably realize your best work to portray the most realistic and dramatic side desired by Marc Webb. Schwartzman was facing the challenge to film entirely in 3D without any conversion, putting the viewer in the place of Spiderman in action scenes. All outdoor scenes and capture the most dangerous side of New York, a darker side and dark city.Even the indoor scenes, whether in home environments uncles Peter at school Midtown, in the sewers of New York or within the laboratories of Oscorp, the climate darker and bluish scenes amplify the threat of the villain or villains of the city. It is important to say that not all the footage actually occurred in New York, as some outdoor scenes and studio also occurred in Los Angeles.
The production designer of the late J. Michael Riva - also responsible for the first two films in the franchise Iron Man - does a great job of riding the school where Peter studied by giving the modern technological environment in Oscorp laboratories by dangerous sets of sewage, and creativity in building every room in the house of his uncles Ben and May, especially in Peter's room, where we see several of his idols, tastes and passions, from his love of science and inventions (which lead to the creation of the trigger webs, but not fluid in web itself, the work of his father), his passion for photography and even your taste in movies and series, with ""Rear Window"" and ""Community"" gaining places on their wall.More than essential in action movies, the soundtrack is composed by this time 2 time Oscar winner James Horner. Responsible for soundtracks to films like Titanic (1997), A Beautiful Mind (2001), House of Sand and Fog (2003), The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008) and Avatar (2009), Horner easily transforms the work into something grand and exciting, even bringing strong remnants of his compositions for ""Titanic"", helps create moments of excitement and tension. Even being a soundtrack of personality and very versatile, is lower than the track from Danny Elfman in the first two films of Sam Raimi.Marc Webb confirms the intention of leaving everything including the real consequences of the actions of Peter. Peter actually shows quite bruised after fights, and his movement resembles the practice of ""le parkour"", with action poses referring directly to the stage character designed by Todd McFarlane. Adding to the mood during the fighting, the Spider is nicer than shown in the versions of Sam Raimi. The action scenes are also very well directed and realistic as the scene of the discovery of the powers in the subway, darkest death of Uncle Ben, the development of powers skate tricks, all the fights with Spider Lizard in the sewer, in high school and Oscorp tower. The presentation of the interior of the laboratories of Oscorp and Gwen's house, as well as the dialogues are very positive overall. The famous scene from the film Sam Raimi's kiss with Peter and Mary Jane upside-reversed, is replaced by the scene in which Peter grabs Gwen to the web and pulls on the balcony of his apartment building.The Amazing Spider-Man had the challenge of proving its existence being launched just 10 years ago the original film and 5 years of the end of the first trilogy, and managed to justify their existence. With a new director and an interesting vision for the franchise, with a cast unquestionable, with a technical finesse evident and well done and exciting action scenes, the franchise is renewed and open space for future sequels. A top notch entertainment and more faithful to the comics than with a longer expected expansion of this universe and this without the weight until the release of this new version, the expectation is even better future films.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","masonsaul","1 January 2019","It's too similar to the previous Spider-Man movies in its plot which makes it feel unnecessary but The Amazing Spider-Man is still a really good reboot that manages to create some of its own iconic moments and set pieces as well as a recognisably different style and tone.Andrew Garfield gives a great lead performance, even if somethings feel a little out of character for Peter. Emma Stone, Martin Sheen and Denis Leary all give really good supporting performances. Rhys Ifans is a really good villain with mostly believable motivation.Marc Webb's direction is fantastic, the film feels extremely practical, probably more than it actually is and the action sequences are well shot and enjoyable.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","FlashCallahan","7 July 2012","Peter Parker is an outcast high schooler who was abandoned by his parents as a boy, leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is today. Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy, and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner.As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny.....My expectations were very low for this movie when I heard it was being made. Initially I thought what was the point, to me Spiderman is still a new movie, and to be honest, the last movie wasn't all that good.But truth be told, I wasn't expecting this, a brilliant movie, but on a par with Spiderman 2.The cast are a lot better, and Garfield nails as Parker, this is the Spiderman we got from the comics, not the wet blanket that Maguire gave us with just looks of awe every other minute.But it does hark back to the first movie, New Yorkers coming together toward the end, the main Bad Guy having some sort of chat with himself, even the guy who killed Uncle Ben in the first movie is the limo driver!! The relationship between Ben and Peter feels more real in this, and it really does have more emotional impact when he is shot this time around. but it is totally a different movie this time around. It's all about high school and Parker gets hurt in this, quite a lot showing his vulnerable side.Spiderman being more cocky is the biggest positive for the film, even though he is in peril, he still has time for a one liner. Stone is amazing as Stacey, she really is more than a damsel in distress (Hello Kirsten).The Lizard is an okay villain, but it just feels like a way over the top villain, and despite a good turn from Ifans, his prerogative just feels like the Jokers from Burtons Batman.It's a well made film, very exciting, and very funny too, I laughed a lot through the film, the inclusion of the new webs is great too, they seem more fluid I this one and are more intricate to Spidermans powers in this, with these he wouldn't be doing what he does.See it and enjoy it, it's really worth seeing","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","aidanratesmovies","26 November 2021","Nearly on par with Raimi's Spider-Man 2 with a familiar outline from Raimi's first Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man holds its own among the franchise as a charming and emotional rendition and focuses on what truly matters most. First off, I just thoroughly enjoy the look of this film, it's very unique full of cool-blue colors and the CGI is just incredibly well done for the time. Andrew Garfield may not be the best actor to take on the role as the web-slinging hero, but he certainly makes the character his own, and for me truly encaptures what it means to be Spider-Man himself. His performance as Peter Parker may not match Maguire's or Holland's just as Maguire's doesn't quite match Garfield's charm as Spidey- but he truly does hold his own and provides a refreshing new take on the character we hadn't quite seen on screen before. Besides focusing on just Garfield as Spider-Man there are many other great actors throughout the film as well, including but not limited to: Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Rhys Ifans and Dr. Curt Connors, and the amazing Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben (an absolute perfect casting choice). The story can be a bit too familiar for its own good at times, and its final battle scenes can be a bit too formulaic and predictable. It has its tonal flaws every now and then, but for the most part, it's much darker than other iterations in the past, and I quite enjoyed a more serious brutal take on the character and the look of it throughout. In the end, The Amazing Spider-Man is far from perfect- but it does manage to hold its own and have enough charm to spare. It may not be the best film of the titular hero, but it certainly makes for a fun ride.My Rating: 8.4/10.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","nickmesafilms","17 July 2012","Directed by Marc Webb, and released to immediate box office success, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a reboot of the original Spider-Man trilogy from director Sam Raimi, that's also the first in a new and re-imagined version of the series! I have been looking forward to check out this movie ever since the news came out. But even though I was entertained by the majority of it all, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is my first big disappointment of the year, but it sure is a guilty pleasure. This movie follows the exact story about a boy in high school, Peter Parker, whose been abandoned by his parents, lives with his aunt and uncle, and can't fit in with his surroundings. Until he gets bit by a radioactive spider, gets impossible powers, something tragic happens in his life, and now becomes Spider-Man. It's the basic idea, yet retold in quite an unnecessary way. That's just my main problem with this movie, now that I've seen this film, it's finally clear to me that a reboot of the Amazing Spider-Man just wasn't a bright idea. I know that some reboots like to change some material, to not make it too similar to the original story. But this movie definitely takes the cake, making major changes to a story that doesn't need to be re-told. Also, this movie totally falls into a mother-load of plot holes. The movie tries to focus on Peter trying to find out what happened to his parents, and live through the tragedy involving his uncle, but the movie quickly takes that away, and instead focuses on Spider-Man saving the city from the Lizard. This movie had no clue which way it wanted to follow! But, did I mention that it was kind of long, and at the same time, kind of slow? Yeah, that's what I thought! But, good news, there were a few positives that helped save this movie. The casting is completely brilliant, all delivering such wonderful and memorable performances. Andrew Garfield really saves this movie, recreating the role of Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man. If it wasn't for his performance, this movie would have fallen to the ground. In every scene, he delivers a great charm to the performance, and makes the audience support him throughout. Emma Stone is also great playing Parker's love-life Gwen Stacy, whom also shares a believable and glowing chemistry between her and Garfield. I bought the romance in this movie, and these two guys were cute together. Although not really interesting as the Lizard, Rhys Ifans still delivers a great performance as Dr. Curtis Connors. Denis Leary plays Capt. George Stacy, Gwen's cop father hunting down the masked hero, and Uncle Ben & Aunt May are portrayed masterfully by Martin Sheen and Sally Field, respectively. The effects are astounding, the music is haunting, and the action scenes just help save this movie by delivering what I came for, fun popcorn entertainment. But overall, there's nothing really special about this movie. Some scenes kind of feel misplaced, there are tons of giant plot holes, and changing this story wasn't that smart. Nothing is terrible about this movie, because I still came to this movie and got what I wanted. I just wish that this movie could have been a lot better, and I was really expecting more from this giant motion picture. Not a terrible film overall, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a fun spectacle, but it's barely quite not the right choice to be rebooted. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", in my review, ""exciting fun, but sadly unnecessary"".","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Doylenf","10 July 2012","Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone make a likable enough pair as the teens who find themselves in a heap of trouble once they learn that Dr. Curt Connors (who transforms himself into The Lizard), intends to make huge trouble for the unsuspecting denizens of the city.It takes an hour for the story to start unwinding at a faster pace, once we learn about Spidey's parents leaving him to live with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (Sally Fields and Martin Sheen). But once bitten by a spider, after a forbidden excursion to an experimental lab, the story leaves some of the character development behind and takes off once Spidey discovers his power of web flights and his ability to deal with school bullying.Garfield never seems quite as vulnerable in the role as Tobey Maguire, but there's a sensitivity necessary for the more intimate scenes. He handles the action scenes well. Rhys Ifans does a commanding job of histrionics as the scientist whose regeneration of lost limbs transforms him into The Lizard, with spectacular effects.James Horner's score is very effective at capturing all the thrills and excitement of magnificent photography and the special web effects are all any CGI fan could ask for, even when seen in 2D.But there's an obvious discrepancy between the rather ordinary script and the magnificent special effects that will leave some disappointed that more time wasn't spent on the script itself furnishing a better story treatment.The whole thing is stylishly directed (especially in the action scenes) by a director with the apt name of Marc Webb.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","zardoz-13","10 July 2012","Sony Pictures has ignored the old adage: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Five years ago, the studio canceled the fourth installment in the Toby Maguire ""Spider-man"" franchise with original director Sam Raimi at the helm. Sony cited escalating production costs as justification for abandoning the series. Now, not only has Sony rebooted it with a different director and a different pair of leads, but also the studio has retooled it with a darker screenplay. You could call it ""The Dark Spider Arises"" because the filmmakers are channeling ""Batman"" in this entry. Unfortunately, ""The Amazing Spider-man"" isn't as amazing as the original ""Spider-man."" ""(5oo) Days of Summer"" director Marc Webb struggles with two problems: a lackluster villain straight out of a bad B-movie chiller and a drawn-out running time. Essentially, ""The Losers"" scenarist James Vanderbilt, original ""Spider-man 2"" scribe Alvin Sargent, and ""Harry Potter"" penman Steve Kloves have kept intact most of the best parts of the original. Dare they depart from the canon? Happily, they've have retained the radioactive spider bite, the confrontation with obnoxious Flash, and the marvelous web-slinging training sequences. Webb and his writers have put into effect some interesting changes. Ostensibly, except for a single close-up on a stack of newspapers, they have omitted the Daily Bugle newspaper. This time around they show Uncle Ben's murder in graphic detail, an event that occurred off-screen in the original. Further, they have made the heroic Peter Parker a lot smarter than he was in Toby Maguire's incarnation. Along the way they have forged a few surprises, particularly with Peter's other romantic interest; Gwen Stacy has replaced Mary Jane Watson. Peter contends with new antagonists both natural and supernatural. The most prominent villain is Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), while the second is Gwen's father, New York Police Department Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) who abhors vigilante interlopers and has nothing but contempt for Spidey. Unfortunately, the film stretches itself perilously thin in the final quarter hour into a 136 minute running time. Actor Rhys Ifans' maimed scientist villain is seamlessly mutated into a giant green lizard, but he lacks half of the ferocity that Maguire's adversaries provided him with in director Sam Raimi's trilogy. The Green Goblin was a lively, audacious adversary, but The Lizard is rather dreary. The special effects are terrific as is the cinematography. Although he is 28 years old, British actor Andrew Garfield looks more believable as a skinny teenager than Toby Maguire. Indeed, he would be fantastic as Norman Bates if Hollywood ever reboots the Hitchcock classic. Several scenes stand out in ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" The scene on the Williamsburg Bridge when Connors mutates into the Lizard is one of the best, with the nimble Spidey compelled to save multiple characters. The most memorable is a little boy stuck in an SUV. What makes this instance so significant is that our hero identifies himself as Spider-Man to a grateful father (C. Thomas Howell) after he has rescued his son. When our hero rushes off to warn Captain Stacy about the malicious machinations of Dr. Connors, Stacy reacts with disbelief because Connors is Gwen's mentor. The scene where Spidey tests his new found abilities to leap and lung is reminiscent of Kevin Bacon's dance antics in the original ""Footloose.""Martin Sheen is good as Peter's uncle, but he cannot eclipse Cliff Robertson in the Tobey Maguire origin. Gwen learns about Peter's alter-ego Spider-Man when he shows up battered at her room in a New York high-rise apartment. The chief difference here between the Tobey Maguire ""Spider-Man"" and Garfield's is that Gwen and he don't kiss with our hero dangling upside-down. One of my chief complaints about this slick reboot is the scene between Peter Parker and Flash. After Peter acquires his mysterious powers at Oscorp, he humiliates Flash on the basketball court and is summoned to the principal's office. Later, Uncle Ben reprimands our hero for wanting a little payback. Stan Lee shows up for his usual cameo. This time around he is in the high school library wearing head phones while the Lizard and Spidey tangle with each other.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Mysterygeneration","21 December 2021","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a remake of the Sam Raimi classic from 2002. For its hero, the film uses footage from ""Superman,"" ""Batman,"" and ""King Kong."" The Amazing Spider-Man is a slick, exciting, and well-designed film. The action is largely well-coordinated, and the CGI is a step up over Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man film. Continuity issues and huge logical failures, according to the me. The film is two and a half hours long and leaves a lot of unanswered questions.","

The ending almost made me cry, and I really think it is thought out. And just based of the ending I am rating this movie 10/10 stars here on imdb.com.SPOILERS!In this movie you can see how Peter really needs Gwen and as tragic as it may seem she dies. You probably wonder why I think that is good, why exactly I think it is food is because you get this kind of ending where you don not long for seeing a new movie with Gwen and Peter and instead a movie with Spider-Man in it.A second thing about the movie that almost made me cry was how brave the little boy in the end was. That he stood up against ""Rhyno"". And then Peter (Spider-Man) swoops in and takes over and completly destroys ""Rhyno"".And this is why i think this movie has one of the best endings of all Spider-Man movies.","

Overall it was a dark, sinister and menacing movie.Andrew Garfield is just a fantastic actor and perhaps my personal favourite as Spider-Man. His geeky look works here but he will struggle to find roles in the future as he is not ideal as a romantic or action figure, a similar position to Ben Wishaw.I can't find any fault in this fantastic movie","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","hitchcockthelegend","16 December 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and collectively written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. It stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by John Schwartzman. Peter Parker (Garfield) was orphaned as a boy when his parents were killed in a plane crash, raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field), he is a clever lad but something of an outcast at high school. While investigating the disappearance of his parents and sporting a crush on class mate Gwen Stacy (Stone), Peter's life is tipped upside down when he is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him abnormal powers.While the Spider-Man franchise doesn't (thankfully) come packaged with the kind of bizarre mania that comes with Batman, the acolytes are a tough bunch to figure out. Sam Raimi's trilogy garnered close towards $2.5 billion worldwide, yet now, with this reboot (actually it's a reimaging) trundled off of the Sony production line, there are plenty of ""fans"" coming forward to say they never rated Raimi's films! Magurie was this, Dunst was that, Raimi missed the beat of the comic version of Spidey and etc and etc. Well I'm sorry, but I just don't remember any fall out apart from the near unanimously agreed upon over stuffing of Raimi's part 3. Perhaps I just didn't go on the right Spider-Man forums? But even then it's hard to argue with a box office take of $2.5 billion, those figures have to be made up of a good proportion of Spidey fans, surely? You would reasonably thinkI mention it because The Amazing Spider-Man has met with reviews from each end of the scale. Those at the high end who support the ""reimaging"" seem to focus on it being close to the real Spidey universe they wanted, with great casting, better effects work and a origin story of worth. At the other end is the arguments that ""reimaging"" a film that is only ten years old is daft, especially since it actually doesn't bring the promised new direction or origin story of worth. In fact it just juggles bits of the Raimi trilogy and plays it out with other Spider-Man characters instead. While Garfield is hardly an improvement since he's way too old for high school as well! The truth is that Webb's movie falls somewhere in between both sides of the argument, and that's not just me being Switzerland and staying neutral! Negatively it plays out as a compromised production and not the film that the makers initially set out to make, there are too many dangling threads and haphazard edits that leave narrative gaps. An Important character disappears off the radar, other characters are given limited time to breathe, and crucial plot points are arrived at with stupendous leaps of logic. A coda spliced into the end credits tries to entice us for the sequel, suggesting that the quick wipe over the origin ""origin"" story was deliberate, it's unlikely, and feels like an afterthought. For a film that purports to be putting its own stamp on the Spidey universe, it quite often makes you think of Raimi's films anyway. It may be The Lizard instead of Green Goblin and Gwen instead of MJ, but the emotional and psychological beats are still the same. Reboot? My arse. Oh and Horner, who I'm normally a fan of, has turned in a score that lacks vim and vigour, it aspires to be full of swirling superhero fervour to raise the goose flesh on your arms, but instead it's just goose, and not a decently cooked one at that. However, on the positive side of things, low expectation really helped me to enjoy the film, and I even watched it a second time to check over some initial reactions I had. There is still a lot to enjoy here. Acting is of a high standard (Ifans' performance as Curt Connors gets better on repeat viewings), with good chemistry generated between Stone and Garfield, the effects work is (obviously) better ten years on; something which gives us a better-more acrobatic-moving Spider-Man, while the whole make-up of Parker as a geek who becomes cocky, even arrogant, really adds a kick to the first half of the movie's coming-of-age narrative bent. It's also good that with a running time of over two hours the makers have the time to expand Peter as a character, making the audience wait with expectation of his life changing date with the spider. As for the villain, it's true enough to say that The Lizard is hardly an inspiring choice, but it does fit in with the whole origin story plan that Webb and his team want to tell. Though it should be noted that those seeking wall to wall fights between Spidey and The Liz are going to go a little hungry. It's big on human story and not the lazy cash in movie it could have been, and undeniably it's fun, but the holes, dangling threads and logic leaps stop it breaking out to achieve its intentions. Looking forward to the sequel, mind 7/10","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","bkrauser-81-311064","4 July 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man tries to recreate and remold the titular hero but does so with diminishing results. Like a radically different cover of an old standard tune, the notes are different but the words are essentially the same. A crazed villain still tries to wreak havoc on the city, Uncle Ben still dies, and the love story is still left unfinished and open ended. There are of course differences but they don't have enough flair or pop to really stand out.It has been only five years since the last installment of the Raimi trilogy and it seems that the principle lesson the studio learned from Spider-Man 3 was don't give the director too much freedom. Sam Raimi's pop sensibilities and ego admittedly got the better of him resulting in disaster. So to compensate for Sam Raimi's too much muchness, they got very green director Marc Webb (of 500 Days of Summer fame) willing to play by the rules at least for now.There were aspects of the film I did like. Much of the impetus of the story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of Peter's parents which brought new elements to the story. Spider-Man comes home with multiple scabs, bruises and welts from the night's action which is much more realistic when you're leading a life of a crime fighter. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was an instantly likable character as was her no nonsense police commissioner father played by Denis Leary. Emma Stone is one of those lucky, popular young actresses who can find universal recognition and praise. She has multiple sides to her which shines in the majority of her performances and makes her incredibly likable. Had the movie been about her I might have actually enjoyed it much more.Which brings me to probably the biggest complaint I have about The Amazing Spider-Man. I do not like Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man. Not at all. At 28 the actor looks too old to be in high school and much too good looking to be the nerdy, mild-mannered Peter Parker he should be. Once in the suit, he spends an awful lot of time without his mask; likely so people will be distracted by the fact that the costume makes him look like a deflated Voight basketball with legs.There are those who would argue that this Spider-Man is closer to the smartalecky, brilliant young genius from the comic books. I respectfully disagree. I question whether such praise is deserved when he impresses Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans) by looking him up on Google then regurgitating what he has read to gain notice. He then further impresses Dr. Connors by giving him the algorithm he needs even though he actually found it in his dad's briefcase and didn't actually come up with it on his own. Then there's the webslingers which I suppose were ingenious until you consider he only invented the mechanism to shoot his webbing. He actually took the cartridges creating the web itself from Oscorp. Oh and then there's the scene where he leaves behind a bulky camera with the words ""property of Peter Parker"" printed on it for The Lizard to find. Yeah not exactly the makings of a genius here.And what of The Lizard? The fact is the character is ultimately treated as inconsequential. An almost compulsory character thrown in because every superhero must have a super villain. His motivations are tenuous at best and nothing in his scenes while transformed really leave an impact. Also as an aside, the New York water filtration systems seem to have an awful lot of exotic looking lizards and great phone reception. Someone should really check into that.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","zetes","11 November 2012","A re-boot of a series that only started a decade ago, and ended just five years ago. As such, it feels unnecessary and probably a tad rushed. It has to go through all that origin story stuff again, and, in my opinion, that's almost always what kills comic book movies, especially ones where I'm already familiar with the origin story (Batman Begins, despite being very well liked, has never worked for me either for the very same reason). It also doesn't help that James Garfield, who has proved himself a really fine actor elsewhere, feels weak as Peter Parker. He just never seems like he could be a super hero. Tobey Maguire really surprised me as being capable in the role, but Garfield doesn't. The film does get better as it goes on, especially after the super-villain, the Lizard, is created (played by Rhys Ifans). Before the classic accident that turns him into the Lizard, Ifans is kind of dull, but the actual Lizard monster is truly an imposing villain and actually kind of frightening. The action sequences are pretty good, though both Spider-Man and the Lizard are CGI creation. It thus amounts to simply watching cartoons fight, but it's well done for what it is. Emma Stone has good presence as the girlfriend, Gwen Stacy. Dennis Leary plays her father. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Sheen's good when he's around, but Field has no presence as Aunt May.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","thescribe7","2 June 2015","As cringe worthy as Tobey Maguire is, you always like him at the end of the day. As cheesy as the original film is, it has a heart and a comic book feel. We felt something during Uncle Ben's speech in the original film. In this film, it is merely glossed over to something that's supposed to add up to more or less the same thing. Also, doesn't anybody ever poke an eye at Peter during all the great powers he has? Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man is perhaps more fitting but he's just missing something. He doesn't have the corny comic book feel to him in this film. I guess this is a more ""serious"" version of the Raimi film but there is no substance here. You have a giant lizard running around doing nothing interesting. Everything that relates to Spider-Man just feels glossed over. I don't even think we find out anything about Uncle Ben's killer. We never see him again! Peter isn't even responsible for anything! There is no guilt felt! There are some subplots in here that don't amount much to anything. To the film's credit, they sure did pull off a better love interest for Peter. Gwen is cute and an actual character. I also do feel like Peter is almost more relatable here. Him and Gwen do process chemistry and are cute. But sometimes we need a bit comic book to it. Or something to it. Something like a story. As stupid looking as the Green Goblin looked in the original film you remember him for his cheesy lines. He was at least a character! This lizard dude is nothing! The film fails to add anything new to the Spider-Man mythos and you forget most of it by a year. Where's those little warm feelings you get when Spider-Man kisses M J for the first time (as bad as her character is)? The film is not memorable nor does it have a warm spider heart. It just feels like your average mediocre movie. Putting comparisons aside, there really is nothing here to marvel at. Peter is likable enough but nothing that special. Nothing special in that there's no character development. He starts fighting and stuttering and ends fighting and stuttering! But the Stan Lee cameo was cool...","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","s-satheesh94","1 July 2012","Hi All, First I am a huge fan of Spidey but what this movie does is making us hate Spider-Man. Marc Webb you are good at directing love stories but you lack a lot in Action oriented movies like Spider-Man.I have a lot of questions after seeing the movie.1)Why there is no proper details shown for the disappearance of Peter parker's parents? 2)Why the movie looks so dark always and almost all the scenes were shot in night? Is Spidey afraid of daylight Mark Webb?3)I didn't see any one writing about the Spider-Man Suit, How did they miss it? The suit looks so bad and it doesn't fit good for andrew garfield. It looks kind of cheap and the design looks awkward. The Sam Raimi version of spiderman had a really awesome suit and looked believable. What made you change the Suit Webb? 4)The changes that occur to peter after the spider bite was not shown as enjoyable as Sam Raimi's version in this movie. 5)The huge disappointment is the Lizard.Its kind of laughable when the lizard speaks. The CG is not good. 6)The3D effect was below average and it is good at some places. 7)The cast is good and I really liked Andrew Garfield as peter parker but not as Spider-Man. All the other characters were good in acting.8)Why Garfield is always taking his mask off. The great thing about the Spider-Man character is the mask and its annoying to see Garfield taking off his mask quite often. 9)Sam Raimi is good in Action as well as in Emotion scenes but here Mark Webb falls down. There is no good action scenes in the first half and the most likable scene is the fight with the lizard and the last Spider-Man web swing scene. It was really good in 3D. 10)This movie doesn't give the satisfaction that Sam Raimi's trilogy gave and this looks kind of waste. Why they go for the decision to make a reboot? they could have done Spider-Man 4. 11)It is really boring and all the scenes remind Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man movie. 12)Huge disappointment and it doesn't look like a super hero movie after it ends. Can see this movie only once for 3D effects. 13)I am sure that Columbia and Marvel will be thinking of getting Sam Raimi back or any other good director. But Mark webb has also done a good job in directing this huge movie in this critical situation. But he has missed a lot in satisfying Spidey fans. Sorry Webb better luck next time. 14) Music is so bad and at some places it is good. Where is the background score in this movie and i can barely remember any music. The music in Sam Raimi's Trilogy is fantastic but this one sucks.15)Hope the sequel will be a great one with some good CG, new and powerful Villain, good Spider Suit, good story and with some really good action sequences.Thanks for reading.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","punch87","13 January 2019","The Amazing Spider-Man reboot didn't arrive with the kind of media circus that the masked vigilante is accustomed to on the streets of NYC. Instead it quietly spun a solid, intricate plot in a corner left abandoned for the past five-years and waited patiently for the buzz to begin. Once word gets out, Marc Webb's Spidey will be swarmed: this is the spandex-clad saviour no one knew they needed.Sure the quips aren't as quotable as The Avengers, or the action as big-balled and sprawling, but there's a real story there and an emotional trajectory that forces you to care. Happy 50th Birthday, Spider-Man. The Brit who got bit, actor Andrew Garfield, is superb as the skater boi meets science nerd turned webslinger. He starts out as an updated outsider, popping contact lenses until he stumbles upon his father's specs in a briefcase that propels him on a journey to discover the fate of his folks.Square specs on and the high school image is complete, with Gwen Stacy (played by an endearing Emma Stone) making the opening act look straight from the pages of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's own Amazing Spider-Man circa '65. Gwen is Peter Parker's intellectual equal, number one in her class if you ask her, excelling as his squeeze and making Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane appear shallow for falling for the hero first, boy second. ""I've been bitten,"" Peter tells a wide-eyed Gwen, ""Me too,"" comes the sincere reply.Their first kiss succeeds in rivalling the memorable peanut smuggling, upside down antics of the Sam Raimi original and delivers a very real and passionate clinch (with webbing). You can practically hear the hormones firing and sparking. She's effortlessly likeable, a honey trap for fans that are bound to feel a creeping dread the deeper the character gets into the franchise. It's billed as the 'untold story' and manages to cover new ground whilst putting a fresh spin on the cornerstones of Spidey's origin. The radioactive arachnid lurks in a lab at Oscorp where Peter's search for the parentals winds up.Here we're introduced to Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who's working on a formula that can regrow limbs (including his own absent appendage) and ultimately make everyone equal. It's a noble ambition and one that easily gets out of control, fluidly slipping into danger territory once the experiment goes awry and he becomes a giant city lizard. Ifans plays the tragic antagonist with subtlety, teasing the would-be father figure role before his descent into full-blown, green tinged madness. This scientific development marks a huge breakthrough in villainy that leaves the Lokis of the world looking around wildly for a better excuse. The film is by no means flawless, though.The CGI rendering of the Lizard really is as awful as you suspected it might be. Police Captain George Stacy sums up the incredulity we feel with a curt, ""Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?"" You never quite believe the monster is there in the scene rather than in a computer and his booming voice is too over-the-top evil to be taken seriously. Step away from the microphone and snarl or something, Rhys.There's also an unnecessary nod to the comics when he shrugs on the shredded lab coat for the final showdown and engages in fighting talk that teeters uncomfortably on cringe. Even Spidey's wisecracks misfire when he starts pounding on a car thief, kicking off a running commentary that Iron Man should have given him pointers on. Elsewhere, the script is much slicker and succeeds in spinning a yarn that will have you displaying genuine concern for the main players, and even the fate of some bit-part ones. Martin Sheen makes a wonderful Uncle Ben and he's given some great material to work with, whilst Sally Field's calm and confrontation-skirting Aunt May balances the guardian double act.Much like the original venture, The Amazing Spider-Man takes its time developing the characters so that by the time Peter gets in his first sticky situation, you definitely give a damn. Incidentally, the scenes where his spidey senses kick in are some of the best in the film, adding humour that the Tobey Maguire version lacked as he grapples with his newfound super strength; slamming doors never looked so satisfying.This reboot also corrects what irked so many the first time around: those web-shooters. True to the comics, Peter has manufactured his own artificial weapons loaded with super-strong adhesive. The fact they are artificial rather than organic also gives him a weakness, which every good superhero needs. The whole shebang was captured in stereoscopic 3D rather than a shoddy post-conversion and if any superhero was going to suit this medium, it was always going to be Spidey. He shoots from one corner of the screen to a truck to a crane leaving us suspended, 60-storeys up in downtown New York and in awe of the view.The city makes an exhilarating backdrop for his urban ballet and seems much more grimy Gotham than The Daily Bugle's usual technicolour beat. Patriotic parades and daytime adventures are traded for back alley brawls, gunfire and those graffitied arachnids that form part of Spidey's viral marketing campaign, on and off film. Thanks to this stellar retelling, Andrew Garfield's spin will be going global.","

But its a good one time watch, and probably lovable for those who got fed up with the Sam raimi - toby maguire Spiderman trilogy.. To be fair, The Amazing Spiderman might be close to the plots in comics, Ha! but then the rebooted comics version isn't a good reason to reboot an already successful movie series. Dejavu when you get to see too many scenes so identical to the 2002 film, understandably all grown from the same roots, hmm and like many, i strongly believe the reboot version was a bit early to be made..Some better things, however, worth mentioning : the pretty Emma stone who is much better than Kirsten Dunst ( don't give a darn whether its Gwen or Mary Jane, they are meant to be Spiderman's Lady love anyways). A strong villain in Dr.Lizard, thanks to good CGI (poor characterization and casting though) and finally Music composed By James Horner. Andrew Garfield is cute - a good leap from ""The Social Network"" - but isn't quite the lovable Peter Parker we know.The script, the dialogues and the closing lines were all lacking the firepower and the emotional vibrancy, just to make a comparison, the voice-over of Tobey's Spiderman(With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift, my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-man.) still gives me the flare, which sadly is a huge miss with the rebooted movie. Memories afresh how I got crazy with Spider-Man(2002) during my schooldays!! hmm, The Amazing Spider-Man never comes close. 6/10","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","SPZMaxinema","6 April 2022","Andrew Garfield was not a convincing Peter Parker and the villain's plan was really dumb, not to mention the hideous-looking suit (and I get it, it's an origin story but still). There were some good moments but it by no means saved the movie from being a let down. Even though this was meant to improve the hero's story and portrayal over the Raimi movies, it just ended up making those movies look better. Andrew Garfield didn't really shine as Spider-Man until the end of Amazing Spider-Man 2 and No Way Home in my opinion.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","vithiet","30 December 2018","Ok yes, we JUST had a few Spider Man movies when this came out. But that doesn't mean this one is not good. In fact, to me, it is way better than the 3 previous ones. It is more faithful to the comics and Andrew Garfield makes a better Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. Too bad some of the special effects are not up to what was available in 2012.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","LW-08854","26 December 2023","A new fresh take on the spider-man story. Looking at some of the positives compared to the 2002 version, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone had natural chemistry and Garfield as Spider-Man was a fine choice, with more jokes, truer to the comics. His wiry frame also worked visually as Spider-Man. The special effects are obviously a lot sharper and more realistic than the CGI from 2002 which does look a bit dated now. Emma Stone dances circles around Dunst when she's acting and Gwen's character has far more depth and life than MJ.One negative I thought was that the portrayal of Uncle Ben and Aunt May wasn't as good as the Sam Raimi version and the back story with his parents didn't do much for me, Aunt May is more or less written out of the second half of this film.In contrast to the 2002 version the film switches the focus of Peter's emotional relationship from his Aunt to his girlfriend. Maguire's 2002 portrayal of Peter comes across almost sexless at points, it isn't great for a superhero to be scared of women. When Peter tells MJ at the end he only wants to be friends, Only a friend?"" she asks?. ""That's all I have to give,"" Maguire says....hmmmm. In this version (2012) the chemistry between Peter and Gwen is a little more suggestive, they are meant to be real teenagers after all, not just asexual characters in a kids film, superhero films are no longer made for little children anymore but basically for adolescents and adults these days, The Amazing Spider-Man gets this aspect right.The film made the correct choice by just picking a single villain and giving enough time to develop his story, something the sequel failed to learn from. The music from James Horner complimented the film well too (His last finished work). I think my favourite scene was when Spider-Man saves the boy on the bridge, a point where we see the kind side to Spider-Man's as he gently reassurances the boy in danger. Take note Man of Steel, superheroes need to be protecting and saving people not letting thousands die.","

I love Tobey Maguire's one, and I have never watched Andrew Garfield's Spiderman. But then I decided to give a chance. And oh boy.First of all, the movie has its problems like any movie in history, but the good things works for me. I personally like Gwen Stacy more than Mary Jane and way more than MJ. I like the soundtracks, I like Andrew Garfield as Spiderman, so because of that, I give a 8/10 to this movie.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Aaron1375","9 July 2012","I enjoyed the first three Spider-man films immensely even the highly scorned third film. So I was not to sure what to think about a reboot to a still young franchise. However, I just realized that Sam Rami is not Spider-man's creator, that there are thousands of stories and ways to portray Spider-man so why keep us waiting fifteen or twenty years for another film? There is no reason at all, I want to see Spider-man on the big screen and honestly while the first three Spider-man films were enjoyable this portrayal of Spider-man is the more accurate. Does it follow the comic book exactly...well of course not. No comic film does that, why is it even necessary? Sam Rami gave Spider-man organic shooters, bypassed Gwen Stacy in lieu of Mary Jane, and had Sandman kill Uncle Ben...so yes, the formula did not match the comic the first time, so why now or ever? This film seemed to be a combination of the original Spider-man that first appeared in the 60's and Ultimate Spider-man which launched either in the late 90's or early 2000's. And the match up worked and now if they wish to continue the success they need to continue the story in an interesting way and not let it end as badly as the third Spider-man film ended without a resolution.This story is an origin tale, so you know the basics without me going into details. Those not familiar with the ultimate story arc may be confused about certain things such as Peter knowing his parents and things of this nature. The main thing that is different though is the villain as we finally get the Lizard. You also get to see Peter learn to use his powers a bit more here than in the first film. It is not quite the smooth transition. He soon begins fighting crime which leads him to having to try and capture the Lizard. The Lizard has plans of his own though.Things this movie did that the previous films did not do are plentiful. Do not get me wrong, this one was not as good as the second Spider-man film, I am just saying they did the Spider powers better. They also had the web shooters, even when I was at my most negative about this film from the first trailers I salivated over Spidey finally using mechanical web shooters. They also had him move like a spider more. During a fight with a lizard the way he entangled the lizard in the web was very spider-like. They also had a scene where he shot multiple webs in the sewer and used the vibrations to try and locate the Lizard. This Spider-man also wisecracks and constantly talks during battles, another trait missing from the previous entries. So all in all this Spidey was more like the Spidey I know from the comics.The villain is the Lizard and while I enjoyed how they integrated him in the origin plot there was a problem I had with him. Mainly that it was not explained that he could telepathically communicate with other reptiles. I knew why there were so many lizards and such present, but for those not familiar with the character there may be confusion. Just as in his motivations. When fully transformed he hates humans and wishes reptiles ruled the world, while this comes across a bit in the film I read a review where the person questioned his motivations and how he became evil so quick. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was great, much cuter than Kristen Dunst and looking more like the character she was portraying. I thought her and James had good chemistry and I liked how their romance was not simply he pining for her.Finally, I want to cover one thing that this movie did that I was so happy when a certain something did not occur. That is Gwen did not get taken by the villain and Spider-man did not have to rescue her! I was so certain this would happen, but to my surprise and delight it did not. Sorry, but Mary Jane being kidnapped at the end of all three of the first films was a bit monotonous. I swear the makers of this film felt this too as it looked like Lizard was going from her and then he just gets what he was coming for and leaves her in the room. Leaving me to think the makers were like ""Gotcha! Ha, thought she was going to be taken for the final confrontation didn't ya?"" So this film was a nice restart, though I do hope they film the movies quicker and get in a good three or four films in and have a complete story done. The first series was good, but it did not end all that well as there were still a number of things left in the air. This one has set up a good beginning and hinted at a future villain in the upcoming films. I believe if all goes well the next film could be the best one yet, but let me reiterate if all goes well. And should they complete this set of movies I would want for them to reboot once again. I love Spider-man and want to see him on the big screen...however, I am good on origin stories so you can at least skip that next time. This time though it was simply nice to watch Spider-man swing his way in and out of danger once again.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","CinemaClown","11 October 2013","When Sony Pictures decided to reboot the Spider-Man franchise, I wondered if there really was a need for it considering that not much time had passed since Spider-Man 3 came out & overall, this franchise hadn't fared as worse as others to justify a reboot. Anyway, The Amazing Spider-Man tries to bring on screen the story of our friendly neighbourhood from its origins. Everyone must already be aware of the premise but in case you're not, it tells the story of Peter Parker & how he became Spider-Man in addition to an ugly, stupid villain thrown in here who is more funny (unintentionally, obviously) than scary. Director Marc Webb tries very hard to take his movie away from Sam Raimi's versions but it ends up with too many similarities in events, much less charm or excitement & is a dumbed down version of the original Spider-Man movie in a new package. Plus, the romantic arc between Peter Parker & Gwen Stacy is just absurd & eye-rollingly cheesy. Cinematography is more oriented to point-of-view shots while editing is just horrible. Visual effects feel incomplete & the music by James Horner is simply no match to Danny Elfman's magnificent score that actually feels like belonging to Spider-Man.Coming to the performances, Andrew Garfield is very much believable in the costume of Spider-Man & does a brilliant job in portraying the recklessness of a teenager in possession of newly discovered superpowers. Emma Stone is a darling as Gwen Stacy but she isn't given much to play with yet manages to tag along with a fine performance. Rest of the cast is simply forgettable. Also, Irrfan Khan's ""pivotal role"" was; to be used as the poster boy for the film's marketing in India, which actually paid off as this movie had a record-breaking opening here.Now those who are still reading this review & are unfortunately fans of this film, few of them might argue that I should not compare this film with the original Spider-Man but if that's the case then what exactly was the point of making this film if it never was going to be better than its decade old version anyway? On an overall scale, adding nothing but only a new dimension (3D) which had its little moments, The Amazing Spider-Man isn't amazing at all & is just no match to Raimi's versions, which are more fun even today. In short, a needless reboot whose needless sequel is coming soon. Good luck, Sony Pictures.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","reb-warrior","12 March 2013","If you're like me, you may have heard that Spider-man was being rebooted, and that they were basically telling the origin story all over again. Well I thought, wait what, but I just saw the origin story!? The Sam Raimi version! What's the point in watching this, and decide not to watch it. Well guess what? You're making a mistake! Tho this is an origin story, with similar elements, it's very different, and something completely new. Yes, Peter Parker does become Spider-man. Yes he does grow up with his aunt and uncle. But that's about all that is the same, and even in these two cases, the ""how"" and ""why"" are different.OK, you may see me make a few comparisons with the Raimi version. Sorry. But it's only because I think some people may not bother watching this because they feel they've already seen it. Just to be clear I really like the first Raimi movie, and the second, tho not as much. The third, not at all.In the Raimi version I found Peter to be an absolute geek. Period. He was always feeling sorry for himself, and had no confidence whatsoever until he got his powers. He was also a complete outcast at school. So much so, that he seems depressed and almost reminds me of one of those kids that was bullied and brings a gun to school. So we're relieved when he gets his powers and we cheer for him. In this new telling we see a Peter Parker whom is geeky, yet cool and likable. Cute and funny even. He has lots of confidence, and doesn't seem like an absolute outcast. His interaction with the lead female character may be a little shy, but not over-the-top uncomfortable as in Raimi's version. This Peter also thinks fast on his feet and has a lot of witty lines combined with his body language(as Spider-man) that really emphasizes Peter's comical wit that you see in the comics and the animated TV shows.Raimi's Peter was all wrapped up in Mary Jane, his tormented feelings of guilt for his uncle's death, and his uncle's message. In this version Peter is focused on finding out what happened to his parents. Something very mysterious, almost a cover-up or conspiracy took place. He's doing this before he gets his powers. We watch as he sleuths, putting together his memories, a file that belonged to his father, and uses the internet to track down information. The mystery brings hims face to face with Dr. Curt Connors aka: The Lizard. The way it goes down that Peter becomes Spider-man, and his uncle's death, is very different here than in the Raimi version. Both are really good. In both, uncle Ben's death is very sad. Do I have a preference? Yes. I liked this version better. Mostly I liked the circumstances better here. In Raimi's version, sorry, but Pete seemed like a total douche-bag with the whole wrestling/money thing. I believe the wrestling version is also the comic book version, but nevertheless that's how I felt. In this version, what happened, just made more sense, even relatable, and fit more in line with Peter's personality. Oh where, oh where is Mary Jane coz she always needs rescuing? She's always falling from a building or a super-villain has got her! Wow, wow, wow, what a difference with Gwen Stacey! She didn't need rescuing! I liked her right away. She's intelligent, and I loved that she began crushing on Peter BEFORE he got his powers. Without giving anything away, there is this moment where she and Peter are talking. He has a secret which concerns her. Not love stuff, OK. Something else. I'm thinking, oh no, just tell her, she really needs to know this. But guess what? She figures it out herself. As I watched I felt relieved that she wasn't walking away from Peter with the impression that he's a lousy person. She knew the truth. I really liked her and Peter together. Great chemistry with the actors.One thing that really struck me in this movie was today's techy world. Peter using his cellphone for communication, messages, and pictures. Him calling his voice-mail to hear his uncle's last message a couple of times. Gulp. How many of us have loved ones that have passed, and we saved their last voice-mail message? The last thing they said to us, their voice, means so much. It's a part of our social culture now. I loved the way they used this.I've always wondered about Peter's parents. I'm not an avid comic reader or anything, but every now and then I'd read one. I never read anything about them, tho it may have been written, I dunno, but the ones I've read were always Peter that grew up with his aunt and uncle, and never any explanation as to why. I found this origin story a tightly-knit, well acted, well rounded tale with a twist at the end, that leaves me looking forward to the next movie. I'm curious to see how this mystery unravels.So, if you haven't watched this because you think it's the same story as the Raimi version, let me clarify, it's not the Spider-man you think it is, and it's terrific!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","aesgaard41","30 January 2013","You just can't review this movie without comparing it the to Tobey McGuire-Sam Raimi trilogy that gave birth to it. Sam Raimi already created the special effects and style that helped make Spiderman a movie character so it wasn't that hard for someone else to come in and slide on the work already done there. What I don't like about the new movie is that Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is a young jerk. I really don't see Peter Parker stealing a security badge, sneaking into a secure scientific lab, antagonizing Flash Thompson, alienating his Uncle Ben nor mocking a car thief. If anything, Garfield's Spiderman like Christian Bale's Batman talks too much. The best part of the first movies was its believability, something that was sort of missing in the third movie and is definitely missing in this installment. (The scene with Peter discovering his superhuman strength is nothing but slapstick and looks out of place with the rest of the movie.) Now let's get to the new suit. It looks horrible!! I had a hard time accepting Tobey's Peter could create the costume he wore, and I have an even harder time accepting the new costume (much less that Garfield's Peter could even get the material!). It just looks horrible! In the dark, the red and blue colors run together and look purple. Even worse, Garfield looks horrible in it. The first bright version had a muscular body suit under it; the new version has nothing. About the only thing this movie has is better chemistry between its stars. I really had a hard time buying Kirsten Dunst as a high school kid, but Emma Stone really sparkles as Gwen Stacy and really blows the former ""Interview With a Vampire"" actress out of the water. That's basically where ""Amazing Spiderman"" (Spiderman 4?) works best. The story between Peter and Gwen takes center stage, but Rhys Ifan, possibly best known as Captain Hook from the Peter Pan prequel, works well too; his right arm is digitally removed with the same technology that removed Gary Sinise's legs in ""Forrest Gump."" The problem is the villain's story as the subplot takes up too much screen time. It was handled great in the first two movies, overdone in the third movie and extremely noticeable in this movie. It just takes too long getting into the plot. What bothers me most is the unnecessary reboot to Peter's origin. Do we really need to make Peter that much more tragic by over-emphasizing the reasons why he was left with Uncle Ben and Aunt May. I have nothing again Martin Sheen or Sally Field in the roles, in fact, they share just about the same amount of wonderful chemistry as Garfield and Stone, but there's too much exposition here to a movie where we already know who the characters are. I also can't stand the fact that the movie is a reboot; re-inventing his origin and chopping out whole chunks of it, and what's this thing about the mystery of his past? What mystery? He was left with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. End of mystery. Bottom line: Amazing Spiderman is passable, but Sam Raimi with his familiarity to the subject already pulled it off, and we've seen it before. We've seen everything before. The only new thing is the chemistry between Garfield and Stone, but is that all it takes to make us believe this movie is superior to all the hard work Sam Raimi already did? The hard work was already done; this movie is just sliding forward on the momentum. Take this movie back in time to BEFORE Spider-Man 1 and then I'll say it outdoes the original, but then, that would make the original not so original, wouldn't it?","

So, I was a bit doubtful about it.BUT I WAS AMAZED at how good this movie turned out to be! I personally believe that it's the best of all Spiderman movies. It was packed with emotions, action, brilliant CGI, and a fair bit of humour. I must admit that the Spiderman role suited Andrew Garfield and I would love to see him in this role in future movies. It was amazing in 3D and I would advise watching it in 3D.I am not going into any details. Just watch it and you would see for yourself.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","jiou_bajiet","19 January 2022","I do not dispute that many people really did not fully like Sam Raimi's film ""Spider-Man 3"", but our favorite actors, led by Tobey Maguire, took part in it, the special effects were as always on top, and not to say that the plot was completely bad. But it seemed to the studio that it was necessary to rethink the franchise with a new cast of performers. Mark Webb was invited to the post of director and filming of the ""New Spider-Man"" began.The image of Peter Parker, or the Spider-Man himself, was tried on by Andrew Garfield, and we meet him in high school. Peter is a very smart and quite interesting guy, he could easily be cool, but he tries not to shine and do what he likes. The hero even strikes up a friendship with the charming Gwen Stacy, but this is not exactly a romantic story. Then there will be something tougher.""The New Spider-Man"" may not be the most ideal movie, but it looks interesting and is able to make us worry about the characters and the current situation. When you care about what's going on with the plot, it means the movie is not bad at all.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","jagooch","13 July 2023","The movie feels like they added a plot after coming up with the special effects. It checks the boxes of the expected plot points, but the acting and character development are non-existent. The movie doesn't give you a reason to care about the main characters, so you are left with just enjoying the special effects or taking a nap.Emma Stone looks nothing like Mary Jane from the comics, and doesn't have a believable character arc. She goes from not liking to loving Peter Parker for no apparent reason. I guess it had to happen for the plot to move forward, but it does not happen in a convincing manner.My advice is to watch the original movies or , even better, read the comics.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","MLDinTN","8 March 2013","Sorry, but this movie was horrible compared to Toby Mcguire's first Spiderman. I loved that Spiderman movie; it was funny and had a great story. In this remake, it's not funny and everything in it has been seen before. And Andrew Garfield goes around with his hair sticking up and just wasn't good casting. The way Peter Parker finds out about his super powers was no where near as good. And this movie copy cats so much from the first, like having Ben die, how he designs the spidey suit, how he gets back at the bully at school. And all of it was done worse in this film than the first one.FINAL VERDICT: I'm so glad I waited till this was on cable so I didn't pay to watch it. I recommend watching the Toby Mcguire ones and staying away from this.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","secondtake","14 July 2012","The Amazing Spiderman (2012)What do you do with a movie that's impeccably well made, acted to the pitch required of a superhero movie with realistic themes, and filled with really fluid wow factors? I mean, this is a really compelling movie on some levels. And if you like these kinds of movies (and there is no shortage of them every year) this is one of the best, technically, and from the point of view of unaffected acting.What no one wants to say or hear in this context is that the movie isn't everything it could be. Or even worse, it's everything that other movies have already been, including earlier Spiderman movies. Marc Webb isn't at fault--he directs with aplomb, and gets the most from the series of action scenes. It's the writers, and the producers who are guiding the writers, who have to take some rap in presenting another movie about the same kind of thing we've seen too too many times. Or at least too too many times for me, for singing praises.But if you don't mind the formula again, you'll be in for a treat. I know I enjoyed it all even so. The swinging through space, the life or death fights with a hugely powerful monster, the last minute race to stop the doomsday device (with a timer to let us know exactly how much suspense lies ahead), the girl who is smart and pretty and actually pretty capable, too. All of this is in place, and well done.Well done. Is that enough? Up to you. It's hardly the kind of movie the invites deep thinking or parsing out the components. It's more the kind of movie to just rush in headlong and enjoy, and drive home thinking about something else.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","3xHCCH","29 June 2012","There were so many reasons why I was ready NOT to like this movie. First of all, the original Sam Raimi-Tobey Maguire trilogy was so recent, and were done very well and did so well also box-office-wise. I did not really feel the need to make this reboot at all, much less, too soon after the ""Spider Man 3."" I was also very leery about the choice of Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider Man. Watching the trailers, I do not know what it was about Garfield's face and body build that did not seem right to be Peter Parker. Anyway, the hype was still really building up, as evidenced by the grand first day showing today in almost 100% of cinemas all over the country. Of course, it was inevitable that my whole family will still go and watch!As it began by telling Peter Parker's high school life, you see that Director Marc Webb was trying so hard to make it different from the first Tobey Maguire movie, and this can be noticed as the movie went along. The story of how Peter was bitten by the super-spider was so far- fetched and unbelievable. The story of how Gwen and Peter became a couple was so rushed. The story of Peter's parents which was what I thought would be a main theme in this movie was hardly tackled in detail at all. Andrew Garfield painted a different Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. Garfield made the role his own by amp-ing up the angst. I have to grant that Andrew was a better dramatic actor than Tobey. His scenes with veteran actors Martin Sheen and Sally Field (as Uncle Ben and Aunt May) were heartfelt and sincere, as with his romantic scenes with Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy). However, he seems to become schizophrenic when he dons his Spider Man costume, as he becomes all too cocky for comfort. Emma Stone acted very well as Gwen Stacy. She was a much better love interest than Kirsten Dunst was as MJ in the first movie. I guess it was because Gwen was written to be smart and courageous, unlike MJ who was nothing more than a mere damsel in distress. Rhys Ifans does an effective departure from his usual comedy roles to play the tragic Dr. Curt Connors. It was just too bad that the story of his descent into Lizard madness was too sudden to be affecting or logical. Admittedly, there were so awesome-looking visual effects in this movie. The cartoony multi-color palette of the Tobey version was replaced by a darker and more serious mood in this one, more fitting into the Marvel canons. Overall though, while the effort was there but the final impact of this film could eventually be forgettable. Even the extra scene in the end credits hinting a second installment was predictable. After watching, all my three kids declared that they liked the Tobey version than this. Ultimately, we still remember the Tobey Maguire films too much for this film to take any serious roots into our memory. Let's see if the next installments will make a difference.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","samarth-sri","18 July 2012","Even though many reviewers are calling this as improvement over Spiderman 1 but I think otherwise. First of the franchise would have done better to make a sequel instead of rebooting everything - with new actors. Since spiderman 3 did not live upto expectations, people started criticizing both Toby & Kirsten. I think they did a pretty good job (even part 3 was not awfully bad). But rebooting doesn't make sense. That too, only after 10yrs. They should have waited another 25-30 yrs for that. Also they should have taken some lessons from the way X-men & Batman franchises have gone. Batman (1989) was possibly the only good movie in batman series and there was plenty of scope for improvement. That's what they did, starting with Batman Begins, Dark Knight & D K Rises (pretty sure it's going to be bigger than Amazing Spiderman, possibly overtake even Avengers). Stronger plot, better acting, better direction, dialogues, action sequences, CGI effects etc. They took it to a whole new level. In case of X-men, they started pretty well with X-men 1,2 but had couple of blunders in between. But they corrected it X-men first class. My first X-men movie was X-men FC which was very likable that I watched all the other ones too. But the need for a prequel of X-men was there. Since Charles Xavier and Magneto had worked together as shown in earlier movies. Spiderman 1 already had almost everything (may be a bit rushed though but so is Amazing SM). If there was anything needed, it was a sequel or a completely new plot not a reboot. At the end of the movie, I felt like it was a nice movie BUT WAS THERE ANY NEED FOR IT ?PS - Some improvements are definitely there but there are some let downs as well, the movie has many scenes rushed into it. BUT I'll prefer Spiderman (2002) over ASM.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","rparham","23 December 2012","It was only ten years ago that Spider-Man, the first cinematic adaptation of one of Marvel's crown jewel characters, was released to generally strong critical notices and boffo box-office. After two additional entries, the 2nd being another hit, the 3rd dropping a bit in quality, Sony Pictures and original helmer Sam Raimi couldn't see eye to eye on future entries, so Raimi walked away, and Sony elected to follow in the footsteps of James Bond and Batman and ""reboot"" the franchise only five years since the last entry. This would prove to be a controversial choice with many (I have at least one friend who said he had no interest in seeing the reboot), but I was willing to give this new entry the benefit of the doubt. In general, I can say I was glad I did. The new entry, titled The Amazing Spider-Man, is a fairly strong film for the most part. Sporting a good turn in the lead by Andrew Garfield and an expanded focus on the relationship between Peter and his first girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, The Amazing Spider-Man manages to vindicate itself from those who might doubt it.The Amazing Spider-Man does re-hash the origin story that most are probably familiar with at this point, albeit with some new twists on the material. In this incarnation, Peter Parker is left with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) under mysterious circumstances by his parents in the middle of the night in the opening scenes of the film. When the narrative jumps forward to the present, Peter is a gawky outsider, imagined as both a science nerd but also a bit of a teenage rebel, riding a skateboard and slightly flaunting authority. When he discovers a briefcase of his father's in the basement, Peter begins asking questions about his father's work, which leads him to Oscorp, the company his father worked for. There, he encounters Dr. Chuck Connors (Rhys Ifans), his father's former partner, and the two begin working to complete Peter's father's work. However, the research into genetic regeneration has a dark side, as it would appear that it is intended to be used by Norman Osborne, the unseen head of the company, as a tool to help save his life, and who seems to know something about the reason Peter's parents disappeared.Upon his first visit to Oscorp, Peter happens into a room where testing is being performed on spiders, and one manages to bite him. The result, of course, is that the spider bite imbues him with extraordinary powers: strength, speed and a remarkable ability to scale buildings as if his hands and feet had tape bonded to them. After Uncle Ben is killed in an accidental shooting, Peter begins to use these abilities, along with a formula for advanced webbing his father developed, to search out the criminal responsible for Ben's death. Peter begins to expand his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), a classmate who is also an intern at Oscorp. He also begins to wonder about Dr. Connors, who is acting strangely and, when faced with the shutdown of his research, injects himself with the genetic formula, transforming himself into a creature that becomes known as the Lizard, and this experience sends him on a path to madness that Peter must try to stop.The biggest weaknesses of The Amazing Spider-Man are, unsurprisingly, the revisiting of the same material that was brought to life 10 years ago. Most audience members are familiar with the spider bite, the moments of Peter discovering his powers, and his hunt for Ben's killer. It also doesn't help that in the years since the release of the first Spider-Man, countless other super hero film adaptations have seen the light of day and mined similar material. At this juncture, the origin story plot has really started to show both its age and its overexposure. That being said, The Amazing Spider-Man does approach most of these moments in a different vein than the prior entry. A key difference is to focus on Peter's budding relationship with Gwen Stacy, Peter's first girlfriend in the comics but a character that was relegated to cameo status in Spider-Man 3. Garfield and Stone bring a degree of chemistry and involvement to the relationship and this element of the film feels stronger than the Peter/Mary Jane pairing in the earlier films.Garfield also proves a capable lead in the role of Peter. While Tobey Maguire largely focused on portraying Peter as a somewhat shy nerd, for lack of a better term, Garfield's performance enhances Peter's nervousness and captures the awkwardness of the teenage years, stammering in his dialogue at times and giving Peter a degree of uncertainty in his moments with Gwen. It isn't necessarily better than Maguire's turn, but it is sufficiently different to not feel like a rehash. Stone proves a bit more fetching and strong willed than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane, and her realization of Gwen is certainly the stronger female presence when compared to Dunst.The Amazing Spider-Man also excels on the technical front. The visual effects that bring the action sequences to life are impressive, to say the least, and the film benefits from the decade of development in technology since the first Spider-Man. The moments in which Spider-Man soars through the city and faces off against the Lizard are eye-opening, and prove viscerally involving. James Horner's music score is also a standout, providing a fairly traditional symphonic score in a day and age where so many films are moving towards a sound design influenced musical environment.There is no denying that The Amazing Spider-Man arrives with quite a bit of baggage attached, and it isn't completely successful at slaying all of the downfalls of revisiting this material, but for the most part, this entry works, and proves, like 1998's The Incredible Hulk, that there is more than one decent modern interpretation of a traditional comic book hero.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","diongram","17 July 2012","I recently decided to watch ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" hoping to see a decent adventure now in summer and expecting an even better point of view than the previous movies of Raimi. Well, Spiderman... was not so amazing after all.At first, I will start with a reference at the cast. I didn't know Andrew Garfield (Spiderman) to be honest, and I was unsure about his acting skills. My instinct was right after all. His playing was more like a teenager getting excited to be a mutant hero and the sense of reality was nowhere to be found. It was like he wanted it and it happened. No convincing about his feelings in his act. The rest of the cast apart from Martin Sheen, of course, and a surprisingly good Emma Stone, as the romance person in the movie, was not something special.About the script and directing now. i didn't like it. OK, standard special effects we see in every movie like this, some mildly impressing scenes etc. But, the story WAS MISSING. A lot of loose ends, in fact we learned few things about Peter Parker. The director was more eager to show as how cool was Spiderman that he forgot to show us how he became Spiderman. And here it is Garfield's fault too. He wasn't convincing in his emotions, it was like a super-wow phase it happened to him and he enjoyed it rather than a drastic change in his body and mind and the consequences. My thought is Maguire was better. And the script and cast of the first Spiderman movie, which we can compare with, is better.To sum up, the movie was way below the expectations. A lot of plot gaps, unconvincing acting (mainly from the protagonist) and very limited action are the main points which indicate that you should see the movie only as a last minute choice in the drought of the summer (as I did).","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","TheHonestCritic","28 November 2021","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (2012), why does this ""movie"" exist? No really, why did they make this ""film""? This is yet another worthless and pathetic excuse for a cash-grab. Seriously, the only reason that they made this ""movie"" was to put money in their pockets. Now, I could be wrong about that, but I would be very surprised if I was. This ""film"", just like most other movie reboots/remakes, is entirely pointless. It's easily one of the top ten worst reboots/remakes that I have ever seen. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has a predictable and boring storyline, standard to terrible acting, and a generic cliched soundtrack to attempt to tie this diarrhea stain together. The plot is, a teenager gets bitten by a genetically-enhanced super spider and becomes the superhero Spider-Man. Yes, it follows the exact same storyline as ""Spider-Man"" (2002), but with slight alterations. If you've seen the 2002 movie, then you've seen this pile of filth. It's like they took the script from the 2002 film, copied and pasted it, then just made some slight changes to try and make it a different movie. Which of course, they failed miserably! The biggest differences are: Spider-Man doesn't fight the Green Goblin in this ""film"", he fights Lizard instead. Also, his girlfriend is not Mary Jane this time, it's Gwen Stacy. Other than those two changes, it's exactly the same premise as the 2002 film. It's 136 minutes in length, but it feels like an eternity. Why? Because, it's dull and boring! For the most part, next to nothing of substance happens. As for the acting, it's just as terrible as the story. The majority of the cast does an abysmal job with their performances here. Especially Andrew Garfield! The sad thing is, he plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man himself, the main character. What a huge casting mistake that was. Andrew Garfield is one of the worst actors of all-time, and his performance, or lack thereof, is no different here. Every time he's on the screen, let alone when he speaks, I cringe. Even when his mask is on, the annoyance still shines through! Most of the acting from the rest of the cast suffers because of him. The only ones who appear to be trying, are: Emma Stone, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Everyone else does horribly with their acting! One thing I need to point out, is the casting of Sally Field as May Parker. Just hear me out, she did a decent job with her performance here. The only problem, is that she looks way too young to play that character! May Parker in the comic books is supposed to be older woman with gray hair. Did no one in the casting session pick up on that? Or, just look for a picture from the comics? Talk about lazy casting, what an embarrassment! As far as the soundtrack by James Horner goes, it's about as generic as you can get. Granted, it does have it's moments here and there. But overall, his film score adds nothing to this ""movie""! That's a shock, because James Horner has written many great film scores. What happened to him here? Any way, let's get to the only two good elements in this piece of garbage. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in New York City! As far as the special effects go, they are well-done and still hold up today. They do get a bit cheesy at times, but I still give them a pass. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is one of the most pointless reboot movies in the history of cinema. Whenever I think about it, I shudder with sheer disgust. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I have to tell you to stay away from this ""movie""? I think that's more than obvious enough. Just stick with the original ""Spider-Man"" trilogy with the one, and only, Tobey Maguire. Not only are those three films the best ""Spider-Man"" movies, it just so happens to be one of my top ten favorite trilogies of all-time. Any way, those are the real ""Spider-Man"" films! All of the other ones suck, big-time. If, for some reason, you feel the need to subject yourself to ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", you won't be cheering: ""go web, go!"" Instead, you'll be shouting: ""go movie, go!"" You'll just be sitting there, waiting for it to end. What a pile of trash it is!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Thekeybaldemasterrises","3 July 2012","OK, let me start off with the other people, they clearly are not comic book fans, and don't pay attention to the news, what people are not realizing is not everything we expected to see is revealed in this movie, it's gonna play out later in the series. Alright on to the movie, now I myself was concerned that this movie wasn't going to live up to my expectations, I was wrong. Marc Webb and his crew did an amazing job making a great story told again in a way that actually works, Not to mention they hired a great and talented cast for the movie, Andrew Garfield mostly. He really pulls off that nerdy look of Peter Parker that just didn't look that great on Tobey Maguire. Now I wasn't a big fan of Kirsten Dunst, I never was. Emma stone was a lovable character, and I can really see the chemistry between her and Garfield that looks realistic. Now Rhys Ifans was an interesting character, and his acting was very well done for the lizard. Now this was my only issue for the movie, the lizard was entertaining, but he wasn't as enjoyable as the green goblin William Defoe played in Sam Rami's series. And in shorter words everyone did great being their characters. Now as far as the FX go, they were spectacular, the CG used for the Lizard was impressive too, they are only a few action sequences in the movie, but I didn't care! Peter's character was entertaining all the way through, what some people don't realize about Spidey is he's just a kid, and that life wasn't all Pilates from the city when he began his job as the web slinger; what I see in great comic book movies like this and batman Begins is the realism, cops just don't trust masked vigilantes immediately that's all part of the realism, that's why they prove themselves heroes later in their stories. So above all 10/10, the movie is great, ignore these crazy IMDb reviews and just enjoy the ride!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","jace_the_film_guy","29 July 2021","With three different live-action interpretations in a 15-year span, Spider-Man's cinematic history is deeply complicated. Unlike other franchises which produce reboots to correct past mistakes, Spider-Man has been able to build upon and find depth with each new iteration the web-slinger. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy helped spark the superhero renaissance, Jon Watts' MCU films brought a levity to the character, and Marc Webb's variations brought darkness and grit to the character previously unseen.I absolutely love this film and that is largely due to the cinematography and direction. The POV shots are breathtaking, the bridge scene is mesmerizing and everything involving Uncle Ben and Aunt May is beautifully well-crafted. On multiple occasions, I was either brought to tears or covered in goosebumps due to the captivating performances and emotionally driven storylines. While there is brilliance in every Spider-Man film so far, this one might just be at the top.","

But still Spider-Man 2 is a winner!But that brings me to The Amazing Spider-Man in which I actually was way more into Andrew Garfield's acting as Peter Parker, even if his take on the web-slinger was a tad overacted.And the romance with Gwen Stacey was actually really cute. So, the problems are minimal and I enjoyed the movie with the Lizard being an awesome villain and the action scenes with their intensity.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","akashtaker001","23 June 2012","Saw an early preview. After watching this I think even 3rd one was way better then this. Actually is a Twilight like romance film about Peter Parker. Spider-Man is just there for a little time to attract more viewers. I went for a action adventure film instead I got a love story. Previously I thought Ghost Rider 2 was worst film this year now its Amazing Lame Spider Man. This really happens when you hire a director whose only film is a low budget Romance film. This movie just made me sick, how can you even fool audience by giving a Romance film packaged as an action film. Whatever 3D was used was decent but, climax with Lizard was not anything special. CGI looks very fake and cheesy. The effects in this film are only comparable to first Spider-Man, second and third was way beyond this league. I don't know who was the master mind to green light this script. Because this will not attract the core Spidey fans, but if the studio wanted to attract the Twilight audience they might be successful. To conclude I hope this is the end of Spider-Man and its rights go back to Marvel and Disney so we can see Real Spider Man in near future.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","me-961-82779","4 July 2012","Yet another disappointing superhero ""blockbuster"". I don't think this film can quite work out what it wanted to be. At times there were elements of a darker more serious tone which worked well. But then these moments were spoiled with the usual fast camera editing style of the action scenes which at some points you could not work out what was going on (though I suppose if your of the Call of Duty & Transformers generation this will be appealing to you). Absolutely nothing new or interesting in the terms of plot , the same old good guy who accidentally turns himself bad and ends in a CGI city fight like almost all these Superhero action films endings. Convenient and predictable scenes (the crane scene at the end is just laughable). Good points - I like the new Spiderman, he really captures the ""Smart Ass"" style Spiderman well and is a lot better than the Emo-Spiderman the other one was.","

They movies lacks in holding down audience attention, during the mid-way of the movie, I almost got fed up, that i wanted to leave the movie in between.The ending is the worst, there is no big action sequence like the previous movies. Ending is definitely the weakest point of this movie. The charters have no mutual connection, they characters are soulless and andrew(peter) doesn't look in any shape to be a science geek.SFX were good.The movie also leaves behind the Peter's private and professional side, such as his photography and his arrogant editor.What happened to irfan khan character. This movie is filled with flaws.Final verdict Don't see this movie It is a waste of your money, better wait for the avengers DVD 2/10","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","SkullScreamerReturns","27 September 2021","When this movie came out I was ready to call it unnecessary because why would you need a reboot right after Sam Raimi's very good trilogy? How can there be any new ideas left?But it's surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the 2002 movie but still better than average superhero flicks. The tone is this time a bit darker and more serious, but there is some comedy too. Many new fresh ideas are found. There is more emphasis on Peter Parker being a high school student, and also more sci-fi in the story. Mary Jane is not missed long because another iconic love interest is introduced - Gwen Stacy. Even though MJ is my favorite, Emma Stone is great as Gwen.I think it's a good comic book movie that can be recommended to Spider-Man fans.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","sufyaanrashid95","13 June 2023","The Amazing Spider-Man is a reboot of the beloved superhero franchise, and it breathes fresh life into the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield shines in the lead role, bringing a new energy and depth to the character that is both refreshing and compelling.The movie follows Peter's journey as he discovers his powers and learns to navigate the complexities of being a superhero. The story is engaging and well-paced, with plenty of action and humor to keep audiences entertained.Director Marc Webb has done an excellent job of creating a visually stunning movie, with action scenes that are both thrilling and inventive. The special effects are top-notch, and the 3D version of the movie is particularly impressive.But what really sets The Amazing Spider-Man apart is its focus on character development. The movie takes the time to explore Peter's relationships with the people around him, including his love interest Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone) and his surrogate father figure, Uncle Ben (played by Martin Sheen). These relationships are complex and nuanced, and they add an emotional depth to the movie that is often missing from superhero films.Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man is a must-see for fans of the superhero genre. It is a fresh and exciting take on a classic hero, with a strong cast, engaging story, and impressive visuals. Whether you're a longtime fan of Spider-Man or a newcomer to the franchise, this movie is sure to entertain and delight you.","

Also the action scenes are short and not that exciting. The movie is also missing some real drama and emotion, the dramatic scenes (like where is uncle dies) are just very fast and basically skipped.I also think that Spiderman is really weak here, he doesn't really feel like a superhero. He's running away from some gangster and gets shot by policeman. If I knew the movie was like this I wouldn't have watch it in the cinema, its just not worth the money.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","estebangonzalez10","8 July 2012","¨We all have secrets: the ones we keep... and the ones that are kept from us.¨Spider-Man is back with a reboot and although it seemed sort of early for it, Marc Webb did a great job with this film by refreshing the story and the characters. I enjoyed the first three Spider-Man films, although I wasn't a huge fan of them. Webb not only refreshed the series, but he also improved it in my opinion by doing one thing: getting Andrew Garfield to play Peter Parker. Garfield, who I really appreciated in The Social Network despite having flown under the radar in that movie, is excellent as Peter Parker. He has the right amount of charisma and wit that his character needs. I loved his performance much more than Tobey Maguire's. The other great addition to this reboot was the inclusion of Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Peter's original love interest in the comics and who was played by Bryce Dallas Howard in the third film. Emma Stone is one of the greatest young talents on the screen and she is just lovely in this film and had great chemistry with Garfield. Webb had proved in the past that he could make a strong romantic film with his feature film debut, 500 Days of Summer, but I wasn't sure how the action was going to work out in The Amazing Spider-Man. The truth of the matter is that the action scenes were excellently choreographed and the film was visually stunning; I had a great time at the theater. I don't know if a reboot was absolutely necessary at this stage, but I had a fun time nonetheless. There are a few similarities between the original Spider-Man and this film, but for the most part screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves chose a different approach in this version of the superhero story. They focused more on Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) troubles in school as a teenager and how he dealt with his parents death. After leaving him with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), his parents never returned so Peter was raised by them with strong moral values. Despite having a great relationship with them, Peter is still hurt about the loss of his biological parents and is trying to deal with it as well as his growing feelings for his classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). While trying to deal with all these normal teenage feelings, Peter discovers a forgotten briefcase of his father which contains some secrets about his past. Peter finds a picture of his father with Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who used to be his good friend and science partner in Oscorp. That is when Peter decides to visit Oscorp and is bitten by a genetic spider. We all know the result of that spider bite: Peter becomes Spider-Man. As he tries to manage these new special abilities, Peter also befriends Dr. Connors in search for answers about his parents past. Peter deciphers an equation he found from his father's briefcase which allows Dr. Connors to make a huge advance in his genetic experiments, which ultimately leads to him becoming the Lizard, Spider-Man's nemesis.If you would've told me that the silly guy from Notting Hill would be playing The Lizard I would've thought it was a joke. Rhys Ifans is great in comedies, but I never imagined he could play an important villain with such success. The people behind the casting of this film did a tremendous job because every character seemed to be played by the perfect actor. I mean who better to play Captain Stacy than Denis Leary? Every role just fit perfectly and that was what ultimately made The Amazing Spider-Man such a fun film. Andrew Garfield with his unique wit and charm works almost in the same way that Robert Downey Jr. did as Tony Stark. It was as if these actors were born to play these roles. The entire cast was great in this film, so was the crew behind the special effects department. The film looks really good and is exactly what a summer blockbuster movie is supposed to be. The Amazing Spider-Man might not be as great as The Avengers, but it still was a really entertaining film worth the ticket price. Spider-Man fans will be pleased and I doubt anyone will be missing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker after this performance, although I still have my reservations over whether or not a reboot of the series was necessary at this early stage.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Smells_Like_Cheese","8 July 2012","10 years ago, I remember seeing the opening of the biggest film that year, Spider-Man. I'm not kidding, I remember everything about that opening. It was the first time I ever saw teenagers bring comic books to the movie doing comparison notes. I remember it being so crowded and crazy. But I also remember loving the movie and I still watch it today. So when I heard that they were rebooting the franchise, I was kind of curious why they were rebooting so soon. But after seeing the trailers, I still wanted to see the movie. I'm not a crazy comic book fan or anything, I just like super-hero movies. So this review is from the movie-goer, not the comic book advocate. I really did like The Amazing Spider-Man, this was a great pick up from Spider-Man 3. It was trying to touch the territory of being like Batman Begins, taking the character and story a little more seriously without the overage of cheesy one-liners and costumes. What worked well for this movie was the cast and story.Young Peter Parker's dad, Richard, gathers up hidden documents, and Peter's parents take him to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, then mysteriously disappear. Years later, a teenage Peter attends high school, where he has caught the eye of Gwen Stacy. At home, Peter finds Richard's papers, and learns his father worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curt Connors at Oscorp. Faking his way into Oscorp as one of a group of high-school interns, Peter sneaks into a lab where a ""biocable"" is being created from genetically modified spiders, one of which bites him. On the subway ride home, he is shocked to find strange spider-like abilities manifesting. After studying Richard's papers, he visits the one-armed Connors at home, reveals he is Richard Parker's son, and gives Connors his father's ""decay rate algorithm"", the missing piece in Connors' experiments on regenerating limbs based on lizard DNA. Connors is being pressured by his superior, Dr. Ratha, to devise a cure for the dying, unseen head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn. He one night does the experiment forcing to him to become a giant lizard and wants to seek revenge on those who wronged him, but Peter with his new powers will try to stop him and save the city.Did I need to see why Peter becomes Spider-Man again? Not really. Also for ""nerds"", our two leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are extremely good looking people. But I'll buy into it and just have fun. I liked the explanation given a little better than the first on why Peter feels the need to be Spider-Man. Also, does Dennis Leary always have to be the downer in almost all his movies? I mean his last lines in the film*Spoiler Alert!!*, he's dying in Peter's arms and tells Peter to leave Gwen alone, that's the finest girl he's ever going to get and he's going to listen to that?! I was telling my fiancé, if I were Peter, I would've hit Dennis before he died and said ""oh, how sad you're dying, just go in peace"" and play it off like it's sad or just screamed after he tells Peter not to see Gwen any more ""Why won't you die?!"". Poor Peter, go get yourself a hottie, Dennis's character was a jerk anyways. I digress; the only thing I have to say that was missing from this one compared to the first Spider-Man, it doesn't quite have Raimi's heart. There are a few flaws with the movie, but all the movies are flawed in one way or another. I think this was a fine addition to the franchise and highly recommend The Amazing Spider-Man, it was a lot of fun.8/10","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","megatronskywalker","20 September 2021","Andrew Garfield is likable as Peter Parker. He has a great performance and his chemistry with Emma Stone is undeniable. Is he a comic accurate Peter Parker? In some aspects yes, in others no. He is still a science whiz and is more or less your ""everyman"" archetype, but gone is the geeky nerd seen in the early comics. This Peter Parker is cool, but still gives off the loner attitude that character needs. I think it works really well, but I understand why some people wouldn't be entirely on board with it.The Lizard plot in this movie was very obviously cut down, and is pretty lacking in general character development. There are a few key scenes that were cut from the movie which make for really compelling character moments, and I have to say the movie is a lot worse off without them. Overall I thought the main story was pretty solid, though.I wouldn't recommend this as an introduction to Spider-Man, but as a fun superhero action movie it's more than solid and is a lot of fun.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","starsteamer","29 March 2013","The other movies are OK. They stick to the original storyline and the acting was fine - it involved quite a few of my favourite actors. But for me, the movies lacked the engagement I had with the comics as a kid when Spiderman was my favourite superhero. Therefore I got bored to the point that I didn't even bother watching the third film. I am pleased to report that for me this is the Spiderman from the comics come to life on the big screen. Andrew Garfield plays the geeky, hopeless, clumsy hero who even though he has amazing powers, is still a nerd at heart. I did prefer Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin but I do love Rhys Ifans who does a great job. The storyline he is attached to is modern and relevant. Martin Sheen is always a pleasure to watch and I shed real tears when he inevitably dies. I had been put off by the last movies but this was much better than I expected. The only thing that puts me off is that Garfield looks so much like tennis player Andy Murray it's weird to see him smile...","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Meven_Stoffat","28 June 2012","I'll admit I was a tad skeptical about the movie. Not in a bad way, but I was unsure if the series really needed a reboot. Sure the third movie sucked, but to have seen a follow-up to it would have been a good idea. However, after seeing an advance screening of this movie in IMAX 3D tonight, I Rescind all my doubts.No, really. This movie is spectacular. Everything about it was just... Awesome. In fact, if anything, the Raimi movies don't really interest me anymore, no matter how much I loved SM2. I know that's a bold statement to make, but seriously, this film fixes everything wrong with the Raimi movies, and is definitely more than just an apology for Spider Man 3.For one, it all starts with the tone. From the opening scene where Peter gets ready for a game of Hide and Seek, there's shades of Nolan's Batman movies in it. Throughout the movie there is an air of neo-noir, in a similar fashion to ""Drive""- even the score hints to a bit of a film noir feel. It suits the film because if anything this is an origin story before a superhero movie. The dark and gritty tone still stays consistent throughout, even in the action scenes.The story might not be totally original but it all comes down to how they handle it, and they sure handle it well. How Peter finds the clues to an unfinished experiment in Uncle Ben's flooded basement, and how he manages to piece the algorithm together with Curtis Connors. They do a good job of balancing out the origin story and the action, I dare say! And the chemistry between Gwen and Peter was very believable too. They didn't devote too much time to the love story, which is always a good thing. The contrast between Peter and Curtis is fantastic as well, and if anything is one of the better hero/villain chemistry works in recent years.As for the action scenes? INCREDIBLE. I must say, I love how they kept them grounded and realistic,saving the epic sweep until the big finale. They scrapped the campy and over the top feel of the original movies and give us rough and brutal fights, just how we want it. Garfield handles the action well and you can tell he did a lot of his own stunts too. The fight scenes between Spider Man and Lizard were fantastic, especially the grand finale in the Oscorp tower at the end!And the acting. I must say the acting was fantastic. Garfield KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK, here. MacGuire was too much of a metrosexual pansy for me to take him seriously. Garfield is a total nerd, and as a result, he gets the role right. He even looks nerdy, and it helps as well. The way he manages to hold back his British accent is extraordinary as well, and his humorous kick he adds to the character works too. Emma Stone is fantastic as Gwen Stacy and adds real depth to the character, in an almost unexpected way. Her and Peter Parker's chemistry works on every level. Ifans is a great villain, and he manages to add an air of sympathy to the villain, making his transformation into the Lizard very tragic and poignant. And Leary... Well, what can we say? Brilliant and funny as usual, he even ad libs a few lines, and you'll know which lines those are (""do I look like the mayor of Tokyo?!"").In short, Webb, Stone, Garfield and Ifans have knocked one out of the park. An absolutely stellar effort thanks to great talent and I can assure you that I  will be seeing the movie again. And I can also assure you that this is a must see, with tons of action, intrigue, humour and dark tone as well. Do not miss it!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","KFstudios2009","21 October 2023","The Amazing Spider-Man was a simple spider-man movie, this time in the main role as Spider-man they introduce Andrew Garfield, that played him just ok, he played like a Spider-man should be played, but he wasn't outstanding and not so funny as the Tom Holland Spider-man, that I like much better. About the movie, I think it was very dark, made in a very retro-noir style, the dark city of Manhattan and the underground lab scenes, introducing the new villain, a scientist that mutates to a green, slimy Lizard that want to kill Spider-man, the plot drived me on, but I can't say it was so entertaining as it could have been. The movie did have some very clear Spider-man elements, they showed us the story of how he become how he is, but no, it wasn't just what I was expecting to happen. The problem was that the plot wasn't much of it. When everything happen, they just added some action sequences to make it entertaining, but it wasn't much of it. The dark-noir style was interesting at first but later it wasn't so much impressive. The school scenes were Spider-man was just Peter Parker was cool, but it lost that element of teenage genre and his romance between him and his girl, Gwen Stacy, wasn't much convincing. His transformation and his rise of powers did happen to slow and random, he acted like it was a normal thing that happen with everyone. I don't know, I watched this once, and I don't want to watch it again. Random is the right word of describing this movie. Fun at times but was mostly a random superhero flick.","

Alright dialouge though a bit cheesy at times. Good acting. The visuals, choreography, and effects were all good. Though the Lizard's design was just garbage. The characters were alright as they were pretty much the same from the comics.Overall an enjoyable flim..but it is a wild card for some people.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","flicklover","15 June 2021","I have only seen The Amazing Spider-Man a couple of times. I remember seeing it the first time and being kind of ambivalent on whether I liked it or not. But as a guy who watches films I like many times I just rarely revisit this one. I have to admit I love the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films and had a sort of disinterest in this one from the start so it did have a strike against it. It had been 5 years since Raimi's Spider-Man 3 and even though it was a mess and many were disappointed by it I have always felt that it was unfairly panned. It was not nearly as bad a some have said. So only 5 years later come this complete reboot. Complete with another origin story explaining how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man.This is not a shot for shot remake of the earlier Raimi films. Peter Parker is played by Andrew Garfield this time and his take on Peter Parker/Spider-Man is different from Tobey Maguire. Garfield plays Peter as more of a slacker with sort of an attitude as opposed to MacGuire's take which was Peter as a put upon geek. Garfield is fine but I just like Maguire's take better.The film deals in more detail with Peter's parents and their disappearance. His relationship with his Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae played by Martin Sheen and Salley Field. The film puts more emphasis on their relationship and the performances are fine but it gets tedious and drags the film down. The villain is Dr. Curt Connors played by Rhys Ifans. He eventually becomes The Lizard. He is the antagonist to Spider-Man. Connors is trying to find a way to regenerate human limbs with lizard DNA. Eventually he becomes The Lizard and of course he and Spider-Man duke it out. There isn't much more than that. The performances are good but the story is just a slightly different version of the Raimi origin story that is just too familiar and not as compelling. This film is competently made but it offers nothing new or memorable. The action scenes are ok but there is nothing distinctive about them. Competent but forgettable action. That is the biggest issue with this film. There is nothing about it that sets it apart or tops the Raimi films. The shadow of the Raimi films looms large here. It's not bad in any way, but it's just average. Nothing sets it apart.Grade: C.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","CriticalOfEverything","6 May 2018","I'm not a Sam Raimi fanboy or elitist. I liked Raimi's original trilogy but it's not perfect. And Spider-Man 3 was OK. But I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't. I have my limits when it comes to dark versions of classic characters and this movie just passes through them. For Spider-Man, this is way too dark. There is some light-hearted stuff here, but I just can't enjoy this movie with how dark it gets. If it was like Spider-Man 2 then maybe I could enjoy it a lot more because Spider-Man 2 along with Avengers: Infinity War manage to put Spider-Man in a dark setting whilst still making it enjoyable and fun to watch with some great drama. This movie just tries too hard with blood, a grim and dark setting, hell, the POSTER for this movie pretty much summarises why I dislike it so much. Other than the unneeded edgyness, the soundtrack was fine, the cast is OK (but Andrew Garfield does not fit Peter Parker at all), and the action is decent enough. But this movie just gives off such a weird and depressing vibe when it's a movie about one of the most light-hearted, fun and cheesy comic book characters of all time. It may be a technically fine movie, but I just can't enjoy it with how much they try and make Spider-Man edgy and dark.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","saadgkhan","3 December 2012","The Amazing Spiderman – CATCH IT (A-) The anticipation for Spiderman movie was building from the time when Sam Raimi and Tobey MaGuire walked out of the franchise because of their creative differences with Sony. After that Sony decide to make a more Gothic and true to its origin Spiderman after huge critical and box office success of The Dark Night rises. Eventually Marc Jacobs, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone joint the reboot. The comparison between the original and reboot Spiderman movies is obvious. Marc Webb did try to make Spiderman as dark as he could have done and Andrew Garfield is defiantly is very talented. He did an impressive job as Peter Parker bringing the emotions which we rarely seen in comic book movie heroes even though he lacked the innocence of Tobey MaGuire's Peter Parker. Emma Stone is nice as always even with her blonde locks. Sally Fields, Martin Sheen, Rhys Ifans and Chris Zylka did a fine job. Though I have to say that Indian actor Irfan Khan was completely wasted and we never get to see for whom he was working and even though in deleted DVD scenes we see Lizard killing him in the tunnels but still no answer for the person he was working for. Finally, after watching the Amazing-Spiderman , I think the first Spider-Man movie was better as it had naive peter, cool organic webbing (even-though I understand the logic behind mechanical webbing) it was natural and animalistic or should d I say Insect-listic of him. The Amazing-Spider man was smart, witty and mouthy from start so when he got powers it was like Cherry on the Cake. The first one has better Villain the Green Goblin as it was rooted within the friendship of young Harry none-the-less Lizard was very real and graphics were spot-on but his logic to destroy and make everyone a Lizard was weird. Kirsten Dunst and Emma Stone both played different comic-book characters so comparison is not fair and since both Peter's had good chemistry with their girls. And now let's talk about ending there is no doubt Spider-Man's ending was Great from accidentally Green Goblin and leaving him his home and Harry walking in on him to saving Mary Jane and Kids at the same time to leaving Mary Jane for ever at funeral and from Mary Jane finding out he is spider-man with the Kiss. Everything was in big Spectacular way. So I did love The Amazing Spider-Man but the winner is Spider-Man Indeed!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","ross_kewl","7 July 2012","So here it is again folks, but this time, its not just Spiderman, its an AMAZING Spiderman. For someone who thought the original Spiderman was amazing, this movie surely would leave a lasting imprint in my mind that would deem this movie truly the most amazing Spiderman film yet. Wrong. Although this movie wasn't terrible, it wasn't astounding either.The movie starts off with your typical nerd who gets picked on by the school bully. Sounds similar nay? Through one way or another Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) finds himself infiltrating a million-dollar bio medical research facility and gets bitten by a spider and starts to exhibit spider-like qualities. To the positives, Andrew Garfield did a tremendous job and I think it would a close contest between him and Tobey Maguire. His smart-ass appeal was entertaining without being too silly. I preferred Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) to Mary-Jane basically because she actually helped save the world instead of being the Damsel in distress. Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) also deserves a mention as the characters death really had a profound effect on Spidey so the acting in this movie is top-notch.The area in which this movie could have been improved was the plot, and I find with a lot of movies lately, that the writing for the plot has let down some great acting. Prometheus (2012) is a perfect example. ""Peter Parker finds a clue that might help him understand why his parents disappeared when he was young. His path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner."" Summary from the IMDb, Spiderman page. The mystery that was presented at the beginning of the movie is never even solved. Why did his parents abandon their only son? It never occurred to me that Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) was trying to hunt down Peter Parker's elusive parents. I never really understood the Connors' motivations. At first he was researching cross-species mutation is a bid to repair his amputated forearm. Then it changes because he thinks human kinds is weak and we should all be turned into monstrous lizards. The fight scenes were a bit unbelievable and silly. I was watching this with my friend and we both take chemistry and we laughed when dinosaur Connors grabbed two coloured solutions, mixed them together to create a HE grenade. Liquid Nitrogen on the top of a skyscraper? Really? I concede that Lizards are able to grow back their tails, BUT NOT ENTIRE F***ING LIMBS!!! Salamanders, which are amphibians can regrow limbs but no reptile that has been identified possesses the ability to regrow limbs. I guess also Peter got bored of pursuing his Uncle's killer and decided to become a superhero instead. The crane guy and his cranes was commendable but cringeful and didn't really have the effect that it intended to have. My final ramble is about Parker defending Spiderman's actions at the awkward girlfriend dinner table scene. The way it appeared to me that Parker was only chasing criminals to find the man who killed his uncle, not a public service. And when he did find criminals he wasn't exactly dropping them off in front of the police station, he was having a great time shooting webs into their crotches.Overall, I think the movie attempted to fit too much in the time frame. There were many ideas that were forgotten during the movie and at points got a bit silly for me to tolerate. This movie isn't terrible and is definitely above 6 stars but doesn't deserve as 8 or higher.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","jayjaycee","14 February 2020","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a 2012 comic book adaptation directed by Marc Webb starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. As many of my longtime followers may know, the annual rewatch of this flick is part of my Valentine's Day tradition. ""Why exactly this one?"" some of you may ask legitimately. I'll tell you. I started this ritual when I was around thirteen years old and this film was one of my all time favourites. So, I said to myself, you either gonna have a date on the day of love or watch Spider-Man instead. What am I to say? For the past several years it has always been the adventure of the arachnid avenger and I gave this old DVD more spins than any spintop I have ever owned. Cupid hasn't been the best shooter in my case, so that's the way it is. First of all, I wanna make it clear that my personal taste in cinema has absolutely changed since then and that this film definitely isn't one of the greatest ever. You know, it's still not bad though. As someone born around the new millennium, I happen to have grown up with every single interpretation of the most famous web slinger. Maguire was the man during my childhood years, Garfield was there when I was in my early teen years and Holland is there now that I have reached maturity (at least, by law). So, I can actually enjoy every adaptation of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. I gotta admit though that I now realize some definite flaws. The most indisputable problem of this flick is that it's obviously spinning it's web around the foundation of the Raimi trilogy instead of building something original in the first place. There are countless stories in the comic books it could have adapted in a way never seen before, but it rather insisted on following the same pattern and sometimes using the same scenes with only mildly changed dialogue. This is where it really shows that it's a reboot rather than an all new adaptation. Aside from these decisions that were probably mostly made by Avi Arad, the director Marc Webb who was literally born for this job (at least, by name) did decent work. He managed well to direct a magnificent cast that consists of academy award winners and nominees. Even though Garfield and Stone are slightly too old to portray high school teenagers (this has always been a problem for the casting directors when it comes to casting them) they still looked wonderful in their respective roles and, in the case of the first, acted superbly in the context of the format. Also, I'd like to point out the atmospheric score of James Horner that is hands down the best aspect of this flick. The screenplay shows both greatness and debacles. First, it's cool that they finally brought The Lizard to the big screen with actually impressive CGI. I've never seen a Lizard speaking with such a prominent English accent before, so that's an achievement. Second, the chemistry between the protagonists is so lovely and some scenes had surprisingly well written dialogue (the dinner discussion!) and the new style of the suit is amazing (pun intended) too. So is the action in the fight sequences that finally contain new camera angles and shots that use the power of swinging for the first time. This innovation is apparently ignored by the most and definitely needs to be appreciated more! Well, but let's get to the negative aspects as well: The film is basically too long with a runtime of more than two hours while one third consists of the origin story that we've all been knowing about and that was at times recreated scene by scene from Raimi's features. Also, the whole ""responsibility"" aspect was altered into something less inspiring and only used as a side theme that never fully reached its whole potential in the story. Additionally, what's the point of building up this whole ""obligation over choice"" symbolism only to destroy and negate it with the last lines? It's undeniably a dumb decision, even if it means that Gwen and Peter can become a couple in the obviously set up sequel. Oh, the immense disrespect to Captain Stacy whose last wish was that his daughter would be left out of it ... Well, we all know how that ends eventually. All in all, this extended Sony advertisment in a Marvel adaptation is a decent fun nevertheless. I'm probably a bit biased, but not that much. It's nice mindless fun for in between and although it's not remembered or appreciated in the pop culture, definitely played a significant role in the history of the hero's films. It's highly influenced by Sam Raimi and suffers from the lack of originality, but remains a childhood pleasure. I'm not sure if I'm gonna revisit it ever again. Let's hope I have a date on Valentine's Day next year. Otherwise, you all know where I'm gonna swing by.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","donutpizza","7 July 2012","While this Spider-Man reboot is certainly more enjoyable than most movies, the previous version was better. The writers went out of their way to change all the little details from the previous version, but kept much of the same major plot points the same.This version's morality points, catch phrases, romance and emotional moments just weren't as well done. And there was almost no comedy. There were no major plot holes, but there were multiple small ones that bugged me. On the other hand, the acting was excellent, by all the actors, and the awkward teenager aspect was well done.But on the whole I prefer the previous version.","

Sally Field looked like a beggar, and her character was very close to non existent.I simply can't understand why anybody would like this movie. I don't even know where to start... The poor dialogs, and the even poorer story. This movie really makes the first Spiderman a favor. I'm certainly not a fan of Tobey McGuire, but Andrew Garfield is a far worse choice for even Peter Parker, not to say for Spiderman in costume.Please avoid this film.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","teixcal-imdb","11 July 2012","Fans of Spider-man comics will still be waiting for an adaptation that truly reflects the mood of the comic-book after leaving the theatre from watching ""The Amazing Spider-man"". As an adaptation the film makes a very good composition of Peter Parker as an high-school student but fails completely in the Peter Parker as an ""adoptive son"" of his uncles. The relationship between Peter Parker and May Parker is incredibly misrepresented. As an adaptation, too much liberties are taken with other traits of the Spider-man character.But, and as a film on its own, leaving aside the supposed adaptation status, The Amazing Spider-man is very unbalanced movie. Peter Parker is never a character one can really relate to. It is too schematic and lacks profundity. Also we never quite understand how other characters like Gwen Stacy and his own aunt May can be so sympathetic towards Peter Parker because his behaviour to keep is secret identity a secret come off as a real jerk. So all the sympathy towards Peter Parker is never believable. Is like people just decided that Parker is OK and nothing he does can change that. C'mon people, get real. The ""origins"" scene, when Parker acquires its spider-powers is also a very unbelievable one. It misses one thing to make it believable: the uniqueness. The way it was enacted, it sounds like anybody can acquire does powers if they found themselves in the position Peter is in, there is no circumstance that let it be a once-in-lifetime occasion and no repeatable to anyone once it happens to Peter Parker. And that kind of finishes everything for a super-hero film. It just doesn't work to think that any time tomorrow or the next day some other guy walks into a room and comes out another spider-man. The film is also very lengthy without any particular reason. It seems that scenes where just included to play with special effects and 3D. Since the special effects are really not particularly awesome it works against the film. The attempt to introduce a larger plot to be continued in sequels revolving around Peter Parker's parents also does not work because frankly the viewer never has anything in the plot that makes one care for Parker's parents. Overall the Amazing Spider-man is a disappointing film. It is not terrible. It is not good. Is ""watchable"" but leaves no impression whatsoever.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","DameFlux","10 July 2012","Andrew Garfield is a terrific actor. Martin Sheen is a superb actor. Sally Field is a mind shatteringly brilliant actor. Marc Webb, well he sure does an OK remake of what was a brilliant film. I cant knock him doing a remake 10 years after , or can I . Feel like you have been here before but someone is tweaking details to avoid looking exactly like the original. This is in no way close to what the original film in originality though and if you went back in time and stopped them making the original this would de-evolve into a boneless mess because of what Sony did . Sony wanted to reboot ala Batman for the profit and nothing else. There are no great lines for Andrew, Martin or Sally. They seem lost in this hopeless reboot! Yes , yes I know it didn't ""suck"" but it not ""sucking "" doesn't excuse that it was pointless and derivative. With all the places they could have gone in maturing Parker and family , the characters that developed and challenged the world. What about Spider Man vs the republican party, anything but to waste all of our time with another reboot . Marc is not Christopher Nolan here, he could be but Sony cheated him! Thats right they took a good director and stole a perfect opportunity by forcing him to reboot! I look forward to his freedom from the cheap money changers trying to cash in.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","artrouble21","27 October 2012","some great acting and Garfield nails the Ditko posing of the original comics, don't have a problem with him being too skinny either. Scenes in the sewers nicely echoed the original comic version of this movie, the Lizard is a formidable foe. HOWEVER the back story sucks. Now Flash becomes a misguided good guy, Gwen Stacy is a science nerd, there is no JJ Jameson instead we have the insipid police character. Parker can't wait to show off who he is to all and sundry, and plot rip offs from the Rami movie abound. And for crying out loud Stan Lee can't get enough of himself even now, someone shoot the guy please, with a gun. Most of the Spidey stuff was fine but all other factors in Peter Parkers life were trashed. Surely this rewriting of the characters life/plot is a DC move. There are other reviews of this that I agree with but as to the massive plot holes thru out this film the biggest must be the end where the 'cure' is dispersed over the city and yet has no affect on SPIDERMAN, double duh. The Rami movie is far better and truer to the original comics, Garfield need to step away from this project before it taints his very promising career.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","FrozenOrphan","6 October 2021","So the start of Andrew Garfield's arc in The Amazing Spider Man (1 and 2). Now, this movie was truly amazing, Andrew Garfield makes a great Spider-Man, maybe not the best Peter Parker, but a damn good Spider-Man. Also, The Lizard? A very unique villain choice. It paid off except for the fact Lizard looks like a Ninja Turtle. It's action packed, it's funny, Andrew's Spidey has the best quips out of the 3 Spideys. So that's why it's a 7/10!","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","ashishk-89-479883","30 June 2012","Movie was not bad but was expecting something different than the last time. The only thing changed was the story, that would not be appreciated by comic lover round the world. Spider man has somehow become more of a Romeo than a super hero. The super hero movies are now being produced to entertain a wide range of people, which is why I feel they have lost their intensity. The way these movies are coming out day is not far when middle aged mothers would be watching these with their little daughters. The creators these days have somehow become very sensitive and are now coming up with crying heroes. I hope the new batman movie would be better than The Amazing Spider Man.Please someone ask these creators to grow some balls and come up with movies like Predator, Terminator, Rambo, Matrix etc. Rather than remaking the same set of movies again and again ask them to come up with some original ideas, and not such amazing ideas.","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","saish746","6 July 2012","The houseful theaters prove that Spiderman's franchise is way bigger than its movies. It does matter who is the new amazing Spiderman, as long as there is more of Spidey than lame Peter Parker. This is fourth sequel which has more of dark Spider-man and his journey finding himself (unknowingly). The first half of movie is a wasted effort to let us know again how Mr Parker was bitten by a spider in a lab and from a timid school boy he turned into a street fighter and designed a costume to finally become a super hero Spider-man. This was so boring journey to re-visit more humanly spidey , even the web shooters were artificial and Webb didn't draw the hero muscular, taking his vice from Ultimate Spider-man. Webb even made the villain little human and comparing Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard with Godzilla will a similar mistake to that of comparing an ant to an elephant.Andrew Garfield was honest as a cute next door school boy however less convincing as a superhero and this time there were no great powers hence no great responsibility. but focused on secrets: the ones we keep... and the ones that are kept from us. A secret formula to grow limbs and mutants. We had so many mutant before and it was also surprising to know that the antidote was made before the poison. The movie lacks charisma of a superhero marvel. Neither the Hero nor the Antagonist was big enough to carry the sequel. We have seen everything before.The promise of turning this one a 3D was another failure. You might see less of graphical heights and more of acting prowess of Garfield. While Sam Raimi was more into super sets and better action, Webb drilled down to emotional aspect of a super-hero. Beware Kids may not like this !!! Mary-Jane Watson was replaced by old timer and more punk smart Gwen Stacy. This too blonde actress was a weak link and Emma Stone had some mixed performance. Rhys Ifans was quite convincing than other casts in the movie. Irrfan had better screen presence than Anil Kapoor in Mission -impossible but he never bragged about it and always confessed it as a smaller role. However he might need to put more expression and eyes while delivering in English. Marc Webb is saved by the franchise'........ 2/5","

"The Amazing Spider-Man","mel_vishal","30 June 2012","What was wrong with this flick? I'm gonna say 7 out of 10 things, which is prolly why I gave this a 3 rating.Shortcomings - 1. The intro was way too long to get Spidey started with his 'bag of tricks' 2. The action sequences were few and far between3. This reminded me of a typical Bollywood movie with script you'll understand when you watch it (I beg you don't, though) 4. Dr. Lizard... really?? I'm sure this is not what Stan Lee had in mind when he created him 5. Andrew Garfield is better off playing the cat. Toby was far more convincing as Spidey 6. BORINGGGGGGGG 7. The latter part of the movie got me very restless, wanting it to end ASAPThe pluses - 1. The special effects were good, although I don't think I saw all that was shown in the trailers 2. Emma Stone was a pretty as ever 3. Big fan of Spiderman - which is why the 3rd star was a grace","

The best of them . When I watched it the first time I didn't think it was the best. But I think it rivals the original spiderman movies. It's not better than 1 and 2 but it's a good movie. I think it helps ive grown up with the movies and not the comics so I dont have any expectations except to go off of tobeys movies and the 90s cartoon series.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","bette1981-1","5 July 2012","It dragged on and I couldn't wait for it to end. I wasted $17. It's a very cliché movie. I would've rather have seen some cheesy Disney movie. I think Spiderman is overexpose and so are most of the other comic character movies coming out. I was dragged into seeing this movie by my friend. I would've rather seen Magic Mike or something more entertaining than this recycled material. I think Hollywood is running out of ideas. I wish I could get my $17 back. That would be nice. Also, I think Emma Stone was a bad casting move. I didn't like the hideous boots she wore throughout the movie. I just didn't enjoy it. Save your money and go see Ted the Movie.....",NA
"The Amazing Spider-Man","sweetboyy_99","27 November 2012","First of all, when i heard they were doing a reboot, my thoughts were mixed. It could be one of those huge Hollywood flops, or it could be an improvement to the three movies. It took me some time to get used to the fact, and today i just went for it and watched it.Many of my friends were critical against this movie, saying it would never work. However, being a huge fan of the spider-man comics AND the three first movies, i loved this reboot! It was a perfect start for a reboot i would say, and i hope we will be seeing more of Andrew Garfield as Spiderman in the future. This movie was more well-thought of than the other three movies starring Toby Maguire as Spiderman. And i got completely sucked into it. I could not get my eyes off screen. And the CGI was beautifully made, it was very detailed and you can notice that the CGI was not left out.I won't tell you much about this movie, you have to go see it yourself, then judge it by yourself. My thoughts were that this was an excellent improvement over the old Spider-Man movies. Of course, that's just my own opinion. But i say that it's worth the time and money to watch. I have to say that there are some let downs in this movie that were in the first three movies though. I won't go into detail, watch it yourself and you will see what i mean.And i love that they skipped Mary Jane and went for Gwen instead. Ugh, i don't know why, but i hate MJ. Anyhow, my point is that this is a huge improvement and is a movie that you definitely should not miss, it's a really good movie.There are some flaws in this movie, but yet i have not seen a movie that does not have any flaws. But i enjoyed it, i really got sucked in to the story and the way they told the characters stories. It was an amazing experience for me seeing the Spider Man series finally getting on good feet. Again, this is just MY OPINION, and i suggest you to watch it yourself and judge it. For me, it's an clear 8 out of 10!",NA
"The Amazing Spider-Man","MikeMagi","30 July 2013","Memo to the producers of ""The Amazing Spiderman"": 1)There's a reason they're called comic books. They may not be funny but at least they're a lot of fun. Unlike this movie adaptation. 2)Being tongue-tied and sex appeal are not synonymous. Sputtering, stuttering and stammering does not make you irresistible to women. Even if you're Spiderman's altar ego, Peter Parker. 3)If the hero of the movie inadvertently maims a half-dozen people in a subway car before he realizes his incredible powers, he's a pretty crappy hero. 4) While crafting a script, the screenwriters should check on what they wrote before. Which might explain why tiny lizards are heading for the sewers and what happened to the killer with the star on his hand. 5) Oscar Wilde loved incredible coincidences. But this isn't a farce. So maybe the fact that the kid who gets bitten by a bio-genetically engineered spider is dating the daughter of the cop who is chasing the masked avenger is just a bit too much deus ex machina. 6)When Peter Parker soars across a basketball court and wrecks the backboard, isn't a medical exam a better idea than detention? 7)Just because a director is named Webb doesn't mean that he's the logical candidate for a Spiderman movie. Or didn't you know he spelled it with two b's? 8) You made one terrific decision. Martin Sheen gives his customary fine performance as Spiderman's Uncle Ben. But don't let it go to your heads.",NA
"The Amazing Spider-Man","sidv8489","24 June 2012","For the first time in life I had the privilege of watching a movie before its release and I must say that I was pretty ""Amazed"". Those people who are mentioning that this movie has shades of twilight , they have certainly not read the original storyline of the comics. The romance of Peter and Gwen Stacy was needed because it certainly is going to be very useful in its sequels. The climax fight between spidey and lizard is really a money's worth. I had really not expected much after I came to know that this movie was directed by a person who has just directed one movie and several music videos. If you are the one who had same thoughts then you are truly in for a surprise. Marc Webb has done an excellent work in doing justice to the comic book character of Peter Parker, unlike Sam Raimi. The blend of emotions and action is what makes this movie a great one. Comic book fans will surely understand the reason for Gwen Stacy's romance with Parker. The action scenes are just too great. At times you can feel that you are actually in Spidey's shoes. Andrew Garfield does a fantastic job and just fits in well with the shy , nerdy character of Peter like that in comics , unlike Tobey whom i always found unfit for the role of Spiderman.. From the storyline one might get a hint that Spidey may join the Avengers team next time. But now that's for Marvel to decide. All in All, this is a must watch for everyone (esp. those who are ardent fans of The Amazing Spiderman comic books)",NA
"The Amazing Spider-Man","anaconda-40658","2 July 2015","The Amazing Spider-Man (2012): Dir: Marc Webb / Cast: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen, Sally Field: Spider-Man has always been the symbolic superhero of extraordinary talent. Why this franchise is being rebooted is a big question since the original series began in 2002. However, Marc Webb does a decent job at breathing new life into the franchise. The screenplay follows the same previous outing yet it still works. Andrew Garfield plays teenage Peter Parker whose parents disappear in the film's opening leaving him with a trusty aunt and uncle. The uncle will be accidentally shot by an escaping mugger. Parker searches for answers regarding his parents and seeks answers from his father's science partner. When he is bitten by a spider at the lab he develops the ability to spin webs and conflict crime. Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, classmate of Parker's who also works in the lab where he came in contact with the spider. Rhys Ifans plays Dr. Curt Connors who was partnered with Parker's father. He has one arm and aims to recreate another. His efforts lead to his transformation into the Lizard, a monstrous villain aiming to transforms all society into lizard people. Martin Sheen and Sally Field play Parker's supportive aunt and uncle who shelter him from facts regarding his father. The principal actors are spot on with their performances but supporting roles, including the aunt, uncle and Gwen's police captain father are all somewhat conventional. We know the drill and wonder why so soon, but the special effects are enticing allowing this reboot to amazing in its visual showcase. Score: 8 ½ / 10",NA
"The Amazing Spider-Man","tedg","7 August 2012","Watching this after ""Dark Knight Rises"" is like moving from Saudi Arabia to Monaco.One is the vision of one man through close, very close collaborators. It takes chances, risks darkness. It has motion and noise, but as part of the world we happen upon.This is the product of a production committee. No one wants to do anything that matters; the goal is to have a the tastiest candy on the block. It takes no chances. It has noise and motion not because of the world we visit, but because the channel we see that world through imposes it on us. The colors are primary. The grunge, where it appears seems to be decals applied to smooth unshadowed surfaces. It has nothing that cannot be found on any other committee- populated shelf.There are two things I noted. They both kill all the fathers. But Batman peppers the world with adult sex of a few different kinds. The way this is woven (the sex and the fathers) is how we encounter the weave in real lives: confusingly entangled. Sure, the Catgirl suit and its corset registered in one familiar way, but the manner of the girl was hardly the conventional model (waif or seductress).On the other hand, Stan Lee's girl was about as sexless as possible. The fatherlessness in this case drives the superhero's soul into a different type of emptiness than Bruce Wayne's condition does, one more monastic. I believe that the world of viewers may be equally divided on which is the more superficial.The other thing concerns a criticism I have noted in many previous Marvel films, but especially the Raimi projects. They just don't understand how to use the third dimension. The first three were lost opportunities to spatially thrill. Now, well after some exciting techniques have appeared in big films, they finally capitulate and use state of the art dimensional flight. I believe the problem was the the original comics did not understand this either all Marvel worlds are flat, and fidelity to the comic vision was paramount.But here they do what everyone else is. And that is the problem. They parceled action scenes out to different effects houses and bought every motion technique on the shelf. So we get a hodgepodge of space, depending on who the production crew was for each segment. I saw this in IMAX 3d. The whiplash was extreme, not from the spatial effects — many of which were fine. But from the shifts in how the space was constructed.Like eating ice cream and tasting steak, then coconut, then tar.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",NA
"The Amazing Spider-Man","frankiesilver-91836","30 June 2022","This film has an entirely different feel from the other Spider-Man movies. I've heard complaints about this take on Spidey, and while I don't think he's the best I don't mind this different take on Peter. He definitely gives off 2000s skater vibes, but is also still an awkward teenager who's just trying to get the girl and do what's right.I don't think this movie holds a candle to the Raimi movies in terms of casting accuracy in looks or portrayal. It seems like they casted a lot of actors just off of popularity. However Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone both have amazing performances.While it's not necessarily better, the new futuristic take on Peter including the father thing is refreshing. Having his father tied to Dr. Connors and Oscorp is interesting but is left unresolved sadly.The Uncle Ben death isn't as memorable as in Raimi's Spider-Man, but it's still emotional. All the emotional scenes are really carried by Andrew's performances. All the way up to the ending battle with that amazing score.Dr. Connors' goal to help disabled people with the cross-genetic experiments is actually really interesting and I felt like I understood him. I was very invested in his character up until his first time becoming The Lizard and his turn to insanity. At that point he was just another crazy villain and all the people he gassed becoming reptile-like was kinda weird, but it is a comic book movie after all.One thing I do have to praise this movie for is the action scenes. The cinematography on Spider-Man's web-swinging is amazing and create some of the most memorable scenes in the film.However I didn't like how worked up Spidey was for half the film. I get it was because of his uncle dying, it's just not the type of Spider-Man I like to see or root for.Still this time I actually didn't mind the more melancholy ending. Definitely made you want to see where Peter's story would go in the eventual sequel.Overall not the best movie but not the worst.",NA

"The Amazing Spider-Man","vitconapchao","15 February 2022","Like many of you, I was skeptical when this reboot movie was announce. Rebooting Spider-Man movies is double edge sword, especially those Raimi Spider-man, which I grew up & have appreciations even move, still rules and still iconic. So when I saw the movie in theater & re-watching this again, the are still some pros and cons that this movie sill have even now.Peter Parker, on the trail of what happened to his disappeared parents, gets bitten by a spider, which lets him stick to walls: not as bad as what happens to Dr Curt Connors when he strays down the same scientific path, though. Peter has to negotiate a number of tricky obstacles in this movie - the disappearance of his parents, the death of his uncle, some fancy needlework, his new girlfriend (and her father, who wants to arrest him), school bullying, and a honking great lizard.I ought to have cherished this film. Andrew Garfield is a lot nearer to the adolescent Peter Parker as initially displayed in Steve Ditko's pencils than Tobey Maguire was, the secondary school foundation is appreciated here rather than dashed through, an interesting secret is set at the focal point of the film right from the beginning, Abrupt Conners' Reptile is both thoughtful and terrifying, the youngster sentiment among Peter and Gwen works, the exhibitions are altogether top notch (even Sally Field, absolutely miscast from an actual perspective, is great), the activity is stupendous, Spidey breaks astute, and a large part of the CGI is eminent (in spite of the fact that I wasn't persuaded all the time by the Reptile).One mayor aspect most people agree is Emma Stone Gwen Stacy, and the chemistry between Garfield's peter parker & Stone gwen stacy. The character Gwen is more likable than Mary Jane, mainly because Gwen personality is inspriration from Mary Jane in comic book & vice versa. Unlike peter & mary jane in raimi, this couple has move chemistry (maybe because they dating in real life & director has direct a romance films before ((500)days of summer) so it helps) & makes us care about them, want them be together; whereas romance between peter & mj kind of unlikable and roll the eyes whenever see them (at one point we care about them but writer drop out). Also the action sequence & the web slinging still hold up.So for what reason did I only like this and not love it? The biggest problems is the movie plays too safe and too rush at the same time. I don't believe this is on the grounds that it's too early after the first trilogy, in spite of the fact that I think the reboot component was superfluous: it consumes time and screws up the pacing. Much as I preferred Martin Sheen, I figure this story might have been told better with Uncle Ben currently in the ground. Pacing is certainly essential for it - there were places where the film invested energy letting me know things I neither needed or had to know when it would have been exceptional to have on with the story. Discussing which, having begun with a secret - which I would have been very glad to see sought after - this was actually dropped pretty from the get-go (to spring up again in a spin-off, most likely), which disturbed me. Indeed, this film was obviously set up as an opener and that, as well, aggravated me - the Lizard plot line was settled, however all the other things wasn't (alright, so it resembles the funnies!). And one more thing a lot of footage, especially in the trailer and deleted scene, should include in final film in order to make movies less feel inconsistent.So, a look back while this movie is quite disappointment, overall I still I enjoy it and have fond memory on it. I don't thing this movie deserve all the hate, especially people appreciate Garfield's Spider-man after No Way Home release. Maybe we should give this franchise a second chance.",NA
