"The Avengers","SPZMaxinema","21 August 2021","This might be controversial to say but this is my personal favorite MCU movie. Up until this point, nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently. Going into this movie in 2012 (having only seen Iron Man beforehand) I was skeptical and not interested. Then my brother took us to the theater to see it and it was one hell of a blast. I was blown away and wanted to watch all of the other Phase 1 movies and learn more about these other heroes. The casting and chemistry between them is on point, the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way, and Robert Downey Jr.'s humor all around is unforgettable, and how can I not mention that glorifying theme song?? Not to mention Stan Lee's perfect cameo!","

"The Avengers","aidanratesmovies","24 June 2021","It's a film that future generations will still be gushing about, much like previous generations did with such classics as Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand. Besides that though, there isn't many flaws. The acting is rather good, Samuel L. Jackson may take a line too seriously or too, but it's all in good fun. Again Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a major standout, and I also enjoyed the return of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth Thor- as well as an improved performance by Chris Evans as Captain America and a great performance from replacement Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo. The action scenes are exciting and tense, there is some camera angles here and there that can be a bit annoying, but for the most part it is rather clear and not awfully tedious action- as many films of this type could be. In the end, despite its campiness and formulaic actions- The Avengers is an incredibly fun time. It takes pride in its stories and characters and makes the most out of an experience that could have easily been phoned in. Its a film that will live on for some time, and one i'm rather glad I got to experience first hand.My Rating: 9.4/10.","

"The Avengers","ivo-cobra8","2 July 2017","Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that. Mark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.The pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's. It was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.Admittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.The Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out. Marvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon. I have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films. The rating I give is 10/10","

"The Avengers","TheLittleSongbird","10 August 2014","Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"The Avengers","krieg8814254","12 April 2012","I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies I've ever seen. It's almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It's not a two dimensional ""team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho."" Most don't like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work ""the other side of the fence"" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you're obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I'm just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that. This movie defines MUST SEE.","

"The Avengers","facebook-124-955845","20 April 2012","I'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiativein that short scene, the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye  (Jeremy Renner) as ""assembled"" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god  Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to ""hulk out"". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for  me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its  caliber.  Grade: A+","

"The Avengers","NORTHPOINTMJM","19 April 2012","If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie really did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film. I couldn't be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, there's the popcorn fun we were all expecting but there's also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well. It's truly a stupendous movie regardless of genre.Marvel did it, they pulled off the culmination of a master plan that's been taking shape for years. They deliver a movie the likes of which we've never seen before and as good of a film that's ever been made in its genre.There's a reason this grand of a movie has never been attempted before now. How do you fully flesh out, care about and establish this vast group and still deliver a fun, crisp and coherent story? It's extremely difficult to navigate that edge-of-your-seat excitement while at the same time caring about each one of the characters and their struggles. One of the most impressive aspects of The Avengers is that they managed to get each hero their time in the spotlight and their own character arc. Every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable intelligence and given room to shine.I loved that the stakes in this film are ridiculously high and the threat so impressive that there really is a need for these diverse characters to come together. That could have been a stumbling block in terms of story but it's treated just right. It's also a great idea that they chose to introduce all the characters to the audience as if you've never seen them before. Sure, the other films set up and give depth to each character but even if you missed their solo films, you'll still know and care about them in this movie.It's also wonderful that everything is as big as it should be. This truly is the comic book epic of our lifetime (the fanboy version of Gone With The Wind circa 1939 if you will) and it all shows up on screen. Everything looks GREAT and feels epic. The equipment (love that Helicarrier), the relationships, the stars, the characters themselves and the battles are all huge and as fully mesmerizing as they should be. There are scenes that are emotional and there are scenes that are going to make any audience member scream ""BADASS!"" and mean it.I'm serious when I say that the big, explosive moments are as grand as they should be but it's the smaller character moments in this film that really take it to another level. At this point, we've all seen how good some CG action can get but grounding it with a great story and with meaningful quieter moments is what makes a movie good. That's the ace up the Avengers sleeve. This is NOT some CGI video game movie. Cut out the action and I'd still want to see this movie. So, it's safe to say that they are replicating the comic book experience on the big screen. Years of depth coupled with spectacle and advanced fiction is a treat for non-comic book and comic book fans alike. That's is The Avengers greatest power... the ability to entertain all comers!","

"The Avengers","planktonrules","12 May 2012","At this point, ""The Avengers"" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...","

"The Avengers","CalRhys","12 July 2014","'Avengers Assemble' ('The Avengers') is a truly enjoyable superhero film that lives up to its hype and creates a story that allows for four of the greatest superheroes to connect in this mega-blockbuster extravaganza. Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed Marvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in 3D, the film is equally as stunning on an average television set, with the final battle between the Avengers and Loki's army being one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie. An impressive and remarkable fantastical superhero flick from Whedon.","

The movie has a very good balance of heroism and humour, great characters' development, an interesting villain, great action-packed sequences and a big use of the CGI.

The idea of putting all the superheroes in one film is a good idea, because viewers get great value for the price of a ticket. The stellar cast and the constant action is quite amazing.

The scenes where he lands at the Stark Tower landing pad and the machines automatically took off his suit is also unforgettable. How all of the agents have different plans, and how this will create conflict, but at the end, when they defeat Loki, they are together again. This movie also serves a major purpose as all of these people have met each other for the first time.If you have watched all of the other Avengers movies, it is pretty funny to see how they have grown with each other. The theme song, composed by Alan Silvestri took this movie to a whole new level. And how this theme song evolved in the later Avengers movies. Even hearing it now gives me chills.","

"The Avengers","IonicBreezeMachine","6 April 2023","At a S. H. I. E. L. D. facility researching the power source known as the Tesseract, Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) oversees the research being conducted by Erik Selvig (Steelan Skarsgard) with the Tesseract seeing some unusual activity. Eventually the Tesseract brings forth Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who has acquired a staff that gives him substantial power and uses it to steal the Tesseract and take control of Selvig and S. H. I. E. L. D. agent Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). In response to the threat posed Fury sends agent Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to recruit Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) due to his expertise in Gamma Radiation being necessary in tracking the Tesseract and also brings in Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and the recently revived Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) to assist in a battle which also sees the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who comes to stop his brother Loki.The Avengers is a 2012 superhero film and the concluding chapter to the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The amount of buildup leading into the Avengers was nothing short of astounding only made even more so when you consider the hurdles this series went through to get to this point. While the MCU had been planned in advance, unlike the comic books it was based upon which had to rely on coordinating the artists, writers, and editors, the films had all that in addition to budgets, casts, and general feasibility with the noted departure of Edward Norton as Bruce Banner following disagreements over 2008's The Incredible Hulk which ended up being downplayed in terms of its significance to the overall universe, and uncertainty that Scarlet Johansson would even return as Black Widow with a back-up script featuring the inclusion of The Wasp briefly considered. However following re-writes by director Joss Whedon that elaborated on Zak Penn's original script, the script and cast was set including a soft relaunch of the Hulk character with Mark Ruffalo stepping in for Norton. Upon release the film garnered the best receives of the series since the original Iron Man and became a massive hit too with a $200 million opening weekend in the United States that carried it to $600 million domestically and $1.5 million worldwide that most likely gave Paramount massive sellers remorse for only taking a little over $100 million for distribution of Avengers and Iron Man 3....whoops. All these years later now free of the buildup and hype that propelled it to blockbuster status, does The Avengers still hold up? In short, yes it does.The movie does a good job of including and paying off all the characters and plot threads established over the previous films with every character getting their chance to shine even seemingly minor characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow who didn't get to do much in their debuts in Thor and Iron Man 2 respectively, but do feel like they're allowed to make more of an impression this time around and get some solid standout moments despite being alongside their powered colleagues. Robert Downey Jr. Is really good as Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth remains good as Thor, and Chris Evans is still as effortlessly likable as Captain America and his traditional values where he fought more overtly evil antagonists are contrasted well against a world with more shades of grey to it and is probably one of the reasons why Captain America's movies tended to be the best in this franchise. The movie also gives some great moments to its supporting cast including Clark Gregg's welcome return as Agent Coulson, Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson get some fun moments as Hawkeye and Black Widow, and Mark Ruffalo gets a fantastic introduction as Bruce Banner/Hulk with some solid pathos from the character as well as some genuinely amusing humorous moments especially in the climax. Loki is also a solid antagonist who is wonderfully despicable embracing his ""trickster"" persona as someone who has considered every possible angle and wants his adversaries to know it. There is the occasional gaffe in storytelling such as with Loki's ""partners"" purposefully kept off screen for the sake of laying groundwork for more sequels and I wasn't quite sure how Thor found out about the Chitahuri (or even their name for that matter) but these are minor nitpicks in a movie that delivers everywhere it should.The Avengers is the gold standard for modern ""cinematic universes"" and many have tried to copy its formula to only modest success if at all (I'm sure we all remember the Dark Universe...oh wait, no we don't). The Avengers does a good job of balancing many moving parts and characters and feels like a well worth it pay off to the films that preceded it while also laying the groundwork for what's to come.","

While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.Our modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.Maybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.There are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the best of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen.","

"The Avengers","lee_eisenberg","16 April 2018","The 21st century has seen more superhero movies than I can count. This year alone has already seen ""Black Panther"". I won't deny that Stan Lee created a diverse variety of do-gooders in the Marvel Universe. ""The Avengers"" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters, Sheldon Coopers, Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in ""An American Werewolf in London""). I'd like to see a crossover between this movie and John Landis's horror movie.Anyway, it's not the ultimate masterpiece, but undeniably fun.","

"The Avengers","seruanyre","16 January 2023","So I recently watched ""The Avengers"" and let me tell you, it was lit. The action scenes were insane and the special effects were on point. But what really stood out to me was the chemistry between the characters, it was like they had been a team for years. I mean sure, As a huge fan, it was amazing to see them share the screen with all these other badass heroes. Overall, I highly recommend checking out ""The Avengers"" if you haven't already. Trust me, you won't regret it.The casting in Avengers is truly exceptional. Each actor effectively embodies their respective character, bringing them to life on screen. Chris Evans portraysals the role of Captain America with a sense of responsibility and gravitas, while Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man is both charming and entertaining. Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk, brings a level of vulnerability and empathy to the character that has never been seen before. Chris Hemsworth, as Thor, seamlessly blends power and humor, and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is fierce and formidable. But perhaps the stand-out performance is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, who imbues the villain with a charm and intelligence that commands the audience's attention throughout the film.The story of Avengers: Endgame is expertly crafted, weaving together a diverse array of characters and plotlines from the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a cohesive and impactful manner. The film is packed with unforgettable moments, from the grandiose action sequences to the more intimate, emotional moments. The climax of the film is truly a sight to behold, bringing all the characters together in a thrilling and satisfying conclusion.Overall, The Avengers is a must-see film. It is a marvel of filmmaking and storytelling, and it will be recognized as one of the best superhero films of all time.","

"The Avengers","dee.reid","9 July 2012","As you well know by now, ""The Avengers"" is a large-scale superhero film that was four years in the making, with no less than four individual - yet inter-connected superhero films - feeding into this film's overall story. Joss ""Firefly"" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets ""The Avengers"" many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind. Sit back and enjoy!10/10P.S.: What happened to Dr. Henry ""Hank"" Pym/Giant-Man and Janet van Dyne/The Wasp? Weren't they part of the original Avengers team line-up (before ""The Avengers #4"" when Captain America became team leader, marking the character's Silver Age debut)? This was my only real complaint about ""The Avengers.""","

"The Avengers","francoischristana","22 October 2023","It is shocking to me that Loki's personal resentment against Thor led to all of this destruction. For what reason did he believe that he would just take control and dictate Earth without any consequences? Earth is not at an advantage in battle, so Nick Fury had the right of using the Tesseract to create weaponry. It took some time to get everyone on the same page, but in the end, their shared goal inspired them to work together as a team, which is why I admired how the Avengers came together. I have never watched the Marvel series before, but now I am totally invested. I am curious to know since Loki did not keep his promises to the Chitauri what will happen next.","

"The Avengers","brandon_lee420","24 April 2012","Believe me when I say that 'The Avengers' was my most anticipated movie ever. I mean, come on, a bunch of superheroes gathering and fighting evil, that is just priceless. And not any superheroes but the most well-known and well-loved. The movie has some of the best actors in Hollywood portraying some of the best superheroes to have ever been created. This movie has loads of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, and, needless to say, Hulk Smash! They were all portrayed on screen brilliantly and I give thanks to the actor for making them feel awesome, cool, and really, really fun. I live in Australia and we get an earlier viewing of the film but for you Americans, this wait is is worth it. When the movie was over, most of the cinema clapped - this was the first time I had ever seen this ever at the movies. Even though it was 12 in the morning, the whole cinema was packed and all of them came out of the cinema satisfied and were glad they paid the $13 to watch it.The plot of the movie is straightforward but done magnificently. Loki, previously seen in Thor, wants to wreak havoc on Earth by letting a group of aliens enter Earth through a portal. It's up to the Avengers to stop him but first they have to solve the rivalries and bitterness between them. The fight scenes between the superheroes are just f*cking AWESOME! I was so excited to see Thor and Iron Man battle it out - that scene was just plain epic.The music and soundtrack in the movie was good and it did a nice job of alleviating the action, and trust me there is a LOT of action. The visual effects are also fantastic, one of the best I have ever seen in a film, and they will leave you in awe. Hulk, along with Iron Man, do a good job of adding humour into the film and ALL of the scenes with the Hulk left everyone at the cinemas laughing. It is pretty obvious that his squad mates think highly of him as seen in the scene where Stark and Loki have a confrontation ('We have an Army' , 'We have a Hulk'). That scene was what did it for me.If you guys are in doubt as to see this then let me assure you that you are gonna get the bang for your buck that you deserve. So far, it is one of the best superhero film made but of all time? Not really sure, guess we have to wait for TDKR to come out. 10/10 - Perfect! 'Over and Out.' 25 April 2012","

"The Avengers","Allswell007","14 April 2012","I just loved Marvel's Avengers. I thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered! This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember when I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat. Example: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said for every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what makes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, GI Joe and even Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and delivers depth with its fun.I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years if not ever!","

"The Avengers","saadgkhan","21 May 2012","The Avengers – CATCH IT ( A+ ) The anticipation for the avenger's movie is undeniable. We have been waiting for this from years. To understand the Avenger's movie it's really important that you've seen all previous Ironman, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America's movies. As the avenger's give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the avengers empty headed about hero's history will be foolish. The Avenger's brings back our beloved Marvel's heroes Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury. Each hero's journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies. Now, The Avenger's stands strong in every department, from direction, production and performances. It won't be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes. The humor, action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous Marvel movies combined. The credit goes to generous brain of Joss Whedon. He brings out something very special out of each superhero. The interaction between all superheroes is something we don't see often, they tease, make fun and even fight with each other. Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman) is great as always. He brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is truly a god of thunder. His entry is as Big as Thor's entry should be, it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him. Chris Evens (Captain America) is indeed the ultimate American Hero, he got the charm and personality of a true America hero. Some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to Mark Ruffalo (The Incredible Hulk). For the first time we see some humor in the actions of Hulk, he is just not a fury green monster this time around. besides Hulk, the biggest surprise is Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), we have seen the part of her in Ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of Black Widow. She is absolutely stunning and fantastic. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is good and I hope to see him someday with Black Widow. They had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson the S.H.E.I.L.D are fun to watch. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is superb, he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in Thor, he has out done himself again. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) appearance is appreciated and I would have loved to see Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) in it too. On the whole, The Avengers is the finest brilliant superhero movie of all time, it's filled with great performance, humor, action, graphics and brilliant direction. Highly recommended in 3D.","

"The Avengers","biochemist","16 April 2012","LA Review of 'The Avengers' (No spoilers)I was lucky enough to attend the Marvel screening of 'The Avengers' on Saturday morning in Century City, CA. This was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before it's release date. Just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director Joss Whedon walked in with Kevin Feige to introduced their little ""Justice League"" movie. Not only did we all laugh, but some booed. lol. If that wasn't enough of a surprise, the soft spoken Whedon introduced on stage Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill). Wow is she stunning in person! The audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (This explained why the secret service like security were searching, wanding everyone. No cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) What a nice surprise for an early Saturday morning screening. I've never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of comics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another. Capt. Steve Rogers was fighting in WWII just yesterday. Having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us. The God of Thunder, Thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesn't understand modern technology on Earth as well. Dr. Bruce Banner has been on the run from the government, practicing medicine in third world countries. He hasn't been the Hulk in two years (What's his secret? ;). Tony Stark is still the same, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. So how do you get them all to interact and play well together? Well, Director Joss Whedon is the secret to making it all work. The highlight of the film for me is how Joss Whedon has all these characters interact. Deep character development was not needed for this film. (That is what the respective movies are for: Thor, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger) He does a great job of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than I would have ever anticipated. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. He took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly looking characters and made it completely work. Seeing as the Avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he not only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen. The movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. A couple of dialogue lines seemed off, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it all makes sense. Each respective character is true and honest to itself. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. It is by far the best Marvel movie to date.So who was my personal favorite character from the movie? Dr. Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) of course! He is by far the BEST Bruce Banner/Hulk since Bill Bixby. His intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than Tony Stark's) and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. As a kid growing up, he was my favorite Marvel super hero. I enjoyed watching Bill Bixby play medical doctor/physicist Dr. David Banner on television. I'd watch, terrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. Yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist, helping those in need. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn't know what to think of it. I knew that he's a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner. Or at least, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. He was a natural fit for this role. Overall, the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye candy. They all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. Assembled, they are unstoppable. When i heard an Avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. The day has finally come. Go see it. Thrice. 10/10 Stars.","

The film's humor is also noteworthy point for me, with Joss Whedon's signature wit on full display throughout. The action scenes are also visually stunning and exciting, with the special effects and CGI in particular being dazzling.The acting is also fantastic, with each actor bringing their A-game to their respective roles.

"The Avengers","scotts863","21 April 2012","I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event.","

Hell, who am I kidding, I've been waiting to see this movie all my life. Who would've thought years ago that ALL these characters could fit in to a film and all of them be done justice? It delivers greatness from scene one and has to be considered the best this genre has EVER produced. Truthfully, as good as some of the previous work has been from every studio, nothing else has come close. That's not hyperbole; I really think most will agree if they see it with an open mind. I loved this movie's depth, heart, humor, gravitas, action, performances, emotion and payoff. I honestly can't wait to see it again with the rest of the world later. Right now, I'm simply basking in the greatness I just witnessed!","

"The Avengers","maddog-50","11 May 2012","film studios just found out that a lot of moviegoers rely on ""reviews"" like internet buyers rely on customer reviews. It is known, that many big internet shops hire review-agencies those only job it is to fake authentic looking customer reviews because a lot of buyers trust the reviews of other customers more than any magazine reviews.That's what is happening here. 80% of the reviews here are written by professional review-agencies which got paid by the studios. If you look closer and compare the text of those ""best movie ever"" reviews (or variations of that, such as ""i did not expect much, i am not a superhero fan, but this was greatest beyond belief"" ) with reviews written at other moviegoer platforms, you will find a lot of equal phrases and text blocks.I guess that IMDb is aware of that cheating and they support it. This movie is another superhero movie with the very same formula. Superheros need super problems to solve, so that they can shine. Each hero has to face the kind of super problem which is appropriate to his/her individual super powers. They only can defeat the evil threat when they work as a team. But suddenly some social problems between them jeopardize the whole mission to save the humanity from that super tread, as you can guess, and only towards the end they find together again and etc., etc.. A story for retarded eight-year-old's, flavored with as much CGI as you little brain can swallow in the time.A stupid movie with a stupid story, stupid characters with stupid attitudes, stupid CGI and a stupid ending.

"The Avengers","secondtake","26 May 2013","The Avengers (2012)First: this is high energy stuff with lots of superhero fighting. Lots. Beyond that I had to pick and choose what I liked and what seemed to be dragged out a bit. It was never slow, but it was often a bit uninteresting.the real downside to the movie was, well, the plot, which had yet another super huge super awful enemy that required our local team to go out and find a way to conquer. It never really mattered why these bad people were coming (though they do explain why, with a spacey glowing cube and Thor's half-brother having some childhood issues unresolved). The set design, however, was really ambitious, not only with the huge scenes and big CGI effects, but the range and diversity of interiors with a deliberate variety of styles that related to the different characters. And some of the actors and actresses were terrific to watch, even if they didn't really have much to say or do that mattered (besides save the world, of course).If this sounds like I'm not cut out of this type of movie you are mostly wrong. I have loved, for example, the three Nolan ""Batman"" movies, a couple of the ""Spiderman"" ones, and a few oddballs here and there, all of which work on some of the same principles of super villain and a modified New York (Gotham, etc.) as a city of resilient victims to save.Small (relevant) confession: I loved the Iron Man movies and never saw any of the other Marvel character movies like the Hulk. In this all-star get together of a half dozen famous super-heroes I naturally loved the Iron Man parts and was neutral on the rest. Mostly because Robert Downey Jr. is a huge cut above the others of the cast in presence, in humor, in making the whole enterprise a comic book come to life, not a serious save-the-world epic. By contrast, the leader of the bad guys is a wan, half-hearted baddie who didn't create the chills or fear the movie badly needed. As a movie of characters taken from various Marvel comic book (and movie) series, it was how fully the characters were realized that made the difference. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was pretty great, though restrained a bit. The Black Widow in the hands of Scarlett Johansson was stunning to look at but also weirdly restrained (except the fighting of course). Thor was a bore, taking his old school power thing too too seriously. And Captain America, though a likable, cute guy, was also a bad casting job--he had to do more than look good (unlike, say, Gwyneth Paltrow, who simply had to look good since she unfortunately had nothing much to say or do).You'll know if this movie is your thing before you read this or see a trailer. It's a boiler plate super hero action movie with lots of computer effects and a standard villain from the universe menace. (The computer effects, like these skeletal ocean monsters swimming through Manhattan wrecking lots of buildings, are actually, surprisingly, a bit clunky once you start watching the details.) Overall, director and writer Joss Whedon seems a bit overwhelmed here, and has co-written a predictable bit of very expensive contemporary Hollywood stuff and then directed it without quite making it special. Or surprising. I mean, even Samuel L. Jackson is stiff and preachy. The movie has its moments for sure, but that's not enough. Disappointing.","

"The Avengers","moonspinner55","6 May 2012","Simple-minded live-action comic book extravaganza uniting Earth's resident superheroes to thwart Thor's adoptive brother Loki and his faceless army from destroying the world. The 3D effects aren't terribly good, though the film looks expensive and is top-heavy with crushing destruction (taking place in Manhattan, somewhat disconcerting in the post-9/11 years), coupled with blisteringly loud sound effects. Robert Downey Jr. brings his usual panache to the fore as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Chris Evans is a wonderfully well-scrubbed Captain America, but others in the all-star cast (particularly Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Ruffalo and, in a cameo, Gwyneth Paltrow) just appear to be slumming. The script (by Joss Whedon, who also directed) could only be amazing and complex to comic book fans who haven't been comic book fans for very long. It's a mechanical enterprise for audiences looking to be uplifted by the sight of buildings (and people) being obliterated...and the patriotic revenge therein. ** from ****","

"The Avengers","thefilmexpert","30 April 2012","Have movies become so bad these days that a merely well-executed totally formulaic film, like ""The Avengers,"" is heralded as an exceptional film?Sure, this film hits all the marks and has some good one-liners, but once we expected films to be refreshing and new. ""Star Wars,"" while having obvious flaws, provided us a totally new universe with its own unique political conflicts, worlds, and even its own theology (the force). Its first twenty-minutes is mostly watching the story of a robotic English dandy (C3-P0) argue with a chirping rolling trashcan (R2-D2), but amazingly enough Lucas made that unique and crazy idea entertaining. The plot of ""The Avengers"" is just your run-of-the-mill comic book story-line. Compare its plot to that of ""Inception"" or ""The Matrix"" or even ""Back to the Future"" or ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Much of what makes those films so great is that their plots are highly innovative. You have no idea where they are going. You always know exactly where ""The Avengers"" is going. Along these same lines, ""Psycho,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""The Matrix,"" etc. provide classic twists--Norman has gone insane and has, in his mind, become his mother, the film's apparent killer; Darth Vader, the film's main villain, is revealed to be Luke's father; the first half of ""The Matrix"" turns out to have transpired in a totally false reality. Nobody expected these twists. What unexpected occurs in ""The Avengers""? Even its minor twists have appeared in other recent films. Its most significant--Loki allowing his own capture--comes straight from ""The Dark Knight.""Gangster films before ""The Godfather"" were just pulp. ""The Godfather"" transcended the genre just as ""Unforgiven"" did with Westerns. The same is true about ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Avengers"" doesn't transcend; it regurgitates a done-to-death plot. Unlike ""The Avengers,"" ""The Dark Knight"" was more than a comic book film. It was entertaining, compelling, yet it explored complex moral ideas, and its plot went in innovative directions. Did anyone know that ""The Dark Knight"" would end not with a fistfight but instead with a battle between the Joker and Batman for Harvey Dent's soul, a scene that leaves it open to interpretation whether the Joker or Batman really won in the end, a scene far more compelling than any sequence of destruction could ever be? And did anyone NOT know that ""The Avengers"" would end with a huge battle with the Avengers ultimately triumphant? Uncertainty about how a plot will be resolved is what once kept the audience hooked, not the continual spectacle of fights and explosions. In fact, look at the IMDb Top 250. With how many of these films would you know exactly how they'd end if you were seeing them for the first time? In fact, apart from the cartoons, is there a single entry as totally formulaic as ""The Avengers"" is? And let's not forget, did you ever worry that any of the Avengers would not survive? If not, then where was the real dramatic tension? One of the things that made ""The Dark Knight"" so compelling is that one of its two heroes not only dies but is also believably turned evil before he is killed. And did anyone expect what happened to Rachel Dawes, Harvey Dent's girlfriend? One of the things that made ""Psycho"" so dramatic is its main protagonist dies halfway through the film. Great films--serious or fun--must make the audience feel that there is something truly at stake. And do I even have to go into how voting to give ""The Avengers"" a 10 places it on par with the all-time great works of film art--""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Citizen Kane"", ""Vertigo,"" ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""8 1/2,"" ""Manhattan,"" ""Cinema Paradiso"" etc.? A vote of 10 for a film like this diminishes the worth of these works of art that explore the deepest issues concerning the human condition.Though I've brought up some films that are darker than ""The Avengers"" or more serious, that is not my complaint about ""The Avengers"" at all. ""Star Wars, "" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Back to the Future,"" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" were fun movies, but they also had plots that went in unexpected directions, had surprising twists, introduced us to unique characters. The elements I've listed here are what make a film exceptional and deserving of an incredibly high rating. Just a well-done totally formulaic movie like ""The Avengers"" simply does not deserve the praise it is getting. Of course this film does not deserve a 1 out of 10. I would really give it 3 or maybe 3 1/2 out of 5 stars, which is equivalent to a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the IMDb rating scale. However, until others don't alter their votes to put ""The Avengers"" more in line with where it should be in comparison to other great entertaining films of history, my vote will remain a 1. Go watch ""The Avengers"" a few more times. Once you've gotten used to the 3-D, the special effects, the digital surround sound, you'll see that the film is predictable, the jokes are so-so, and the violence of the fights and of the long climactic end battle actually gets kind of boring.If you're a teenager still reading comics or a lover of comic books who's always dreamed of watching Hulk fight Thor, Thor fight Iron Man, then this movie is what you've always been waiting for, but for the rest of us, ""The Avengers"" is not the tour de force it's been made out to be. Oh wait a sec. I just learned that there's a movie based on ""Battleship""--you know, that dull board game for eight-year-olds. I guess movies really are that bad. If you compare ""The Avengers"" only to garbage like that, I guess it really does seem great.Never mind...","

"The Avengers","liberalgems","11 May 2012","Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares, anyway? When Hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies, then where's the financial incentive to make decent films? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades (and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something) for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next,Dark Shadows; and now The Avengers!I am so sick and tired of New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, being attacked in the movies. Hello! It was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3,000+ real people, including my brother's co-worker, wife and unborn child! But what is really despicable is that at the very end of the The Avengers you briefly get to see a real-life news photo from 9/11 mourning the dead. That's just plain, disgusting exploitation! But lets not stop there! At the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local New York State Senator rant about how our Avenger heroes ""wrecked Manhattan."" That our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1,000+ ways are to ""blame"" for all the destruction! Fine! I agree many politicians are real jerks, but to put the letter ""D"" next to this Senator's name speaks volumes about the films real message: Democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful, winy creeps! That's real cute! I thought Hollywood was sooooooo liberal! If you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a ""R"" after the Senator's name? After all, the Republicans in Congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a Federally funded medical fund for First Responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic waste that was released into the air! The Avengers is also plain boring with the most two-dimensional characters in the history of film making! Sure I wanted the good guys to win! Sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty! But, really now, who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching Frosty The Snowman for the tenth time! The last third of the Avengers is nothing more than war porn! I will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from The Avengers as long as I live! Even for free, or if Hollywood offers me a million dollars! Overall, Hollywood has done a decent job with the X-men and the Fanatic Four, but for some reason the right-wing kooks who control the Avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine. No wonder why Stan Lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film! It's just too bad he and the rest of Hollywood has to stoop so low to make a buck!","

"The Avengers","phd_travel","28 July 2012","This is worth at watch but just once. The I wouldn't watch this again. Sure they spent a lot on effects and a grand battle scene at the end but throwing money at a movie doesn't help a weak story.This screenplay is weak - it is a overlong with has some rather strained dialog between the leads. The weakest thing about the story is why the evil guy wanted to wreak so much havoc without much reason. It just felt a bit contrived and isn't very involving. Don't feel for any of the characters.There is some wit and humor from Scarlett's deadpan Black Widow and Robert Downey's rather lame one liners. What happened to the charm of the old action hero movies?","

"The Avengers","higherall7","27 June 2012","Being at one time a young ten year old kid who cut his teeth on 'COWBOY SAM' books and 'JOHN HENRY AND THE DOUBLE-JOINTED STEAM DRILL' as well 'UNCLE ARTHUR'S BEDTIME STORIES', the adventures of the MARVEL UNIVERSE were a welcome introduction into what the older kids were reading and doing. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby somehow as though by divine guidance properly gauged the angst of those teenage years in the Sixties and the zeitgeist of that era. Before the Avengers battled the Space Phantom, I cannot remember when I ever encountered a Superhero like the Hulk. Basically he was a bully in diapers who did not play well with others. After the Avengers at last sent the Space Phantom back into limbo where he belonged, the Hulk related that his feelings were hurt by the remarks others made about him during the heat of battle. He gave the Avengers his walking papers and jumped off into parts unknown.This never would have happened in the JUSTICE LEAGUE.During the showing I attended, after the credits were done, there is a scene where the Avengers are sitting together in a restaurant eating. The expressions on their faces indicate that they would all rather be somewhere else. When I first saw it, it appeared a little non-sequitur and just something added-on to pique interest. But then I went to my Volume 1 of the ESSENTIAL AVENGERS which covers the first twenty four issues of their saga. I decided to use it as a reference for my remarks in this review. When I got to page two of Issue Two, there it was right at the bottom! Essentially the same scene that tagged the end of the Avengers movie. Oh, the setting was different as well as a couple of the characters present or absent, but the theme of the scene was identical to the movie. A bunch of misfits decide to get together and meet regularly in order to increase and better facilitate group cohesion and they can barely stand being in each other's presence! It's the American Experience reductio ad absurdum. It is also the Human Experience should you wish to wax philosophical about it.Reminds me of something I once heard Jesse Jackson declare during a speech and I believe he was quoting Martin Luther King; ""We have to learn to live together no matter how painful, or we'll die apart as fools."" Suffice it to say that for the Avengers working together and living together is particularly painful at times.No, Robert Downey Jr. would not have ordinarily come to mind as Tony Stark AKA IRON MAN, with his yuppie insouciance, but this is a new generation with its own issues and tastes, so there's no use asking ""-where have you gone Errol Flynn and Ronald Coleman?"". They're probably having lunch with Joe DiMaggio. Downey, in his own way, does more than represent with IRON MAN.Knowing this genre intimately and well, this time I may be too close to it to effectively evaluate it. There are all kinds of things in this movie that do not fit, but that's the glory of the Marvel Universe. It is a depot for all the things that do not fit that are somehow made to achieve this transcendent irreverent harmony, rhythm and balance. As Edward G. Robinson once said in THE CINCINNATI KID, ""-sort of like Life-"".Samuel L. Jackson has no real business being in the AVENGERS doing his usual scenery chewing, channeling bits of 'SHAFT' and 'HAWK' and the Black Man's angst about wanting in on the American Dream. For one thing, the original Nick Fury was a white World War Two hero who headed a squad called Sgt. Fury's Howling Commandos. He would probably be in his nineties by now, but only a time chosen few would know that. Besides, that's the beauty of this fantasy scenario. Nobody really questions what or who these super-powered characters are supposed to be avenging. Actually they're more like the FINAL GUARDIANS than AVENGERS. Anyway, you really would be missing the point pursuing this line of questioning. Here are all these odds and ends of personality and death-defying events and cultural themes somehow welded and soldered together in a kind of collage of imagination and experience and juvenile science fiction and it all works because in the end this ain't your universe. It's the MARVEL UNIVERSE and you're just living and thrilling in it. When you look at it that way, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury gets down and gets back, and redefines the American Dream as something more than that house with the little white picket fence and perhaps simply the divine right to be whatever you want to be.Joss Whedon and Zak Penn finally wised up and decided to stand on the shoulders of giants Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, instead of jumping off to do their own thing with the Marvel Universe. They have written a tale to celebrate. Joss Whedon's direction is Marvelouseque rather than a penetrating interpretation that sometimes hits and sometimes misses as in the case with Sam Rami's SPIDERMAN movies.Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Tom Huddleston as Loki, Scarlet Johansson as the Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, all have sufficient back stories now either through prior movies or the comics for the audience to be thoroughly prepared for what they might do. They are all so very nearly the characters themselves that all that's left is to be swept up in the action that is truly our satisfaction. And yet, the thing that makes the greatest impact in the end is the characters themselves.Welcome to the Marvel Age of Comics in Cinema!","

"The Avengers","sandnair87","21 April 2015","The Avengers is a clean-burning, six-cylinder entertainment - a wall-to-wall action bonanza, executed with a fluid coherence. It laughs in the face of expectation and instead sets its own bar that all blockbusters need to follow.Following on from the first Thor flick, the demi-god's evil brother Loki (a deliciously fiendish Tom Hiddleston) is intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an all-powerful energy cube that'll allow him to bring his alien armies to Earth. Trouble starts when this glowing cube of untold power called the Tesseract is appropriated by Loki, who with a nudge from his magic assegai brain-zaps a snap marksman Hawkeye (a competent Jeremy Renner) and a top scientist into his evil scheme of world domination. All that stands in his way is Nick Fury (the ever reliable Samuel Jackson), the head of the covert peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D. who sets about uniting the world's superheroes to avert the threat, rounding up our titular team - Iron Man (a hilarious Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (a subversively charming Mark Ruffalo), Thor (the charismatic Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (a sincere turn by Chris Evans) and Black Widow (the sexy but earnest Scarlett Johansson) – hoping they will be greater than the sum of their parts. Problem is, they're a dysfunctional outfit, with differences of opinion and troubled pasts, and one of them is a gigantic, green loose cannon. Now, with a global catastrophe looming, they must subsume individual will to the collective good. But Loki isn't called 'the god of mischief' for nothing! Before Fury's new super team can find its balance, Loki is in their heads sowing seeds of doubt, distrust, anger and conflict. Can earth's mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet – or is their coming together an even bigger threat than Loki himself?The Avengers doesn't buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast, largely because of Joss Whedon. He weaves all of the powder-keg moments into a story that is meaningful and always makes sense. The point in The Avengers is to bring six separate characters together as a team without sacrificing their individuality and by extension their value as solo franchises and Whedon does an excellent job of keeping the disparate personalities of his protagonists in play. Whedon's script sparks up the exposition with some sparkling dialogue, high stakes and balls- to-the-wall action spectacle. If you don't believe me, check out the thrilling alien-bashing finale on the streets of Manhattan - it is a pure fan boy wet-dream. Smart, funny, pulsating and surprisingly cathartic, Joss Whedon succeeds in appeasing its core fanbase. From ambition to scale to the way it justly balances each remarkable character, The Avengers is utterly stimulating, satisfyingly scripted and damn right faultless big screen entertainment. The Avengers make us do something increasingly rare in these over-franchised times - root for a sequel. Go smash!","

"The Avengers","A_Different_Drummer","27 January 2015","As a reviewer, I don't mess up often but, just like the line where Stark is ribbing Loki, sometimes even an IMDb top reviewer can have performance issues.My first view, I was annoyed that so much time was spent on backstory and it took an hour to get the ball rolling. Although in fairness once this story starts to move in the second hour, it MOVES.By my third viewing I could see the issue. I grew up with these characters and I had expectations. The expectations were incorrect, I now know, because those expectations were the reason the Marvel library was such a mess before the arrival of the Whedon Bros.So what Joss did was analyzed what was not working in past Marvel films then de-constructed the Avengers story, then build a film which could act as a base for future sequels, wit ha solid foundation.And wrote a script to die for. By the third time around I was actually listening to the film instead of just watching, and boy can that guy write.Like the line I posted as the title of this review. It took me 3 viewings to catch it. It is sly, it is sexual, and it is totally easy to overlook in all the action. But I was on the floor laughing.So there you go, it is fun, action packed (last hour), written at an Oscar level, the characters are perfectly cast (except the Nick Fury I grew up with was Caucasion, but I guess no one remembers) and, to keep the suits happy, not only made a bundle on its own but launched a new franchise.So that's a 10***********************************************ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLIND -- ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLINDJust watched this for the 8th time and want to update my review. As of this year (2017) this is, at the same time, one of the best ""action"" films in the history of the medium and one of the best scripts in the history of action films. I believe Joss received only one award for the screenplay, which is a pity, because it shows that the industry simply does not respect this genre. The little twists and turns that hold viewer attention like glue (""I'M ALWAYS ANGRY"" ""PUNY GOD"") are a Whedon trademark, and massively under-appreciated. I will also suggest that nothing with the Marvel brand that has arrived since Avengers I has been this good -- and I am including all their TV and other off-cable projects in that comment. The only flaw, and I mean the ONLY one, is that the close of this film sets an entire armada of ""politically correct"" followups having to do with the public blaming superheroes ... for being superheroes. Personally, as a superhero fan for over 60 years, I think that entire arc sucks and one day Marvel will figure that out. Otherwise perfect film!","

"The Avengers","movieman_kev","2 July 2012","Not much to say about this one that hasn't been said millions of times before. Brilliant comic-based movie that is, for me personally, the second best Marvel movie ever made, right behind Howard the Duck (kidding, kidding the first Iron Man film obviously). Joss Whedon further proves, as if any more evidence was needed, that as a writer/director he's amongst the top of his field. This is also the best Hulk film ever made and makes it more of a shame that the ball was dropped so badly in his own films. Bruce Banner is the stand out, but all the main superheroes have their very memorable moments, save for Hawkever whom is woefully underused and I hope his role is a tad flashed out on the upcoming extended cut.But really my minor gripes about the movie are few and far between.

Unfortunately , it was the comic book Avengers . While I am not such a big superhero action movie fan , I did enjoy the Batman and Watchman movies . However, the Avengers is one film I could have easily passed up . After first battling each other , the Avengers unite and join forces to save the world from the same common enemy . A lot of the action takes place on a gigantic flying aircraft carrier ,No.64 ( not the CV-64 USS Constellation ). This movie consists mostly of very fast paced CGI's and cheesy Iron Man Robert Downey Jr one-liners . Our heroes and (super villain) are practically indestructible as they are beaten to a pulp but always manage to bounce back time after time . I don't know what the Black Widow's super powers were except martial arts and pistol shooting . Some unintentionally funny moments came when Iron Man Downey was speaking from inside his metal suit . It looked like a talking head from inside a goldfish bowl . It just looked so silly ! There isn't much chemistry between these cardboard characters either . If you are 10 years old or an adult with the maturity of a 14 year old boy , who is obsessed with reading comic books, and are addicted to video games, I'm sure the Avengers is your cup of tea . If not, you will be thinking of the 143 boring minutes you just wasted or what other movies were playing next door you could have seen . If you do decide to see this movie , select a seat in the last row to avoid nausea . I would like to see movies that rely so much on CGI's to be made into animated full length cartoons instead . At least the unaware movie goer has a better idea of what is in store for them when they purchase a ticket . This film was definitely not for me ! .... NOT HOT ... pwh","

"The Avengers","AlsExGal","5 April 2017","... but is the ultimate fan of Joss Whedon. I came to this film with virtually no background in the Marvelverse, so I was a bit confused at first. My husband helped fill in the blanks by stopping the film when I had questions, but I have to admit the script did a good job of filling in the blanks minus a few details. This is an excellent film of its genre that incorporates everything special effects can do today with great character development, courtesy of Joss Whedon who wrote and directed this blockbuster masterpiece. Do you know how rare it is to have blockbuster and masterpiece in the same sentence? He has to know that at some level that he, once again, did the impossible. He took what could have easily been a disaster and he produced gold. He created a movie that was fun, and exciting and shaped and brought cohesion to the Marvel Movie Universe and gave each character their time to shine. It has great acting; quippy dialogue; tons of very well done action; and a decent, if underplayed, level of ambiguity to the morality of the characters. They worked individually, they worked collectively. It had lots of Ultimate Alliance moments. Hulk shoves a piece of armor into the giant worm and Thor hammers it into his head, Thor brings his hammer down on Cap's shield and causes a huge shockwave, Thor shoots lightning at Iron Man and causes his suit to boost up to like 400+% giving him a supercharged shot. I love that all of those moments were added. I also love how Joss had a bunch of the heroes fight each other in a way that made sense in the context of the movie. Thor vs Hulk, Thor vs Cap, Thor Vs Iron Man, Hawkeye vs Black Widow, Black Widow vs Hulk. You can't help but love each and every fight. Will people still be talking about it 80 years from now the way they talk about Citizen Kane? Probably not. But Whedon accomplished in the 2010's in making a film in which I was completely engrossed for two and a half hours, had a wonderful and fun time and wondered where the time had gone when the credits rolled. And isn't that why we go to the movies in the first place?","

"The Avengers","dreamerboi23","14 April 2012","I just saw the early screening for San Diego through the top 10 cities on facebook who got them. And suffice to say I am glad I was privileged enough to.First off, this hands down is the best Marvel movie ever. I don't say that lightly. And in terms of superhero movie with maybe the Nolan Batman series being tied with this, I thought Whedon did an amazing job to bring out all these characters in this one movie. I especially like what was done with Hawkeye and Black Widow just because those two didn't really have their individual movie with their back story. You can tell when a comic book fan writes and directs a comic movie because it clearly showed in all areas of production for this film. Going into the film I honestly thought that a lot of the cool mutant action scenes would be strictly Iron Man and Captain America. But Whedon does such a great job giving each mutant their 15 mins of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like ""Wow this guy/chick is a badass"" for every mutant. I will admit i am not a Hulk fan. I like the inner story for it but was never a fan of the films, show or comic. But Hulk's role in the movie is so awesome I became a fan just from it. If any of you are Whedon fans then you guys/girls will love this movie. It has his M.O. written all over the humor and story presentation. And there were definitely parts in the movie where I thought ""Wow this seems like Firefly and Serenity"". And story aside, if you read, watched, or idolized Marvel superheros as a kid, the action alone will make you cheer just out of sheer nostalgia of imagining The Avengers or X-Men all together on the screen kicking ass. In summation, I don't need to say you NEED to watch this movie because I think anybody who is anybody already knows they want to see this. All this review has done was just reaffirm the hype behind this movie. I don't say this much but job well done Marvel and Disney for hiring a writer/director who has the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic fans who are the backbone of Marvel comics being a success. And in this day and age of superhero movies and movies in general that is very hard to do. Cheers Joss Whedon!","

"The Avengers","Michael_Elliott","15 May 2012","The Avengers (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Nick Fury brings together Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow to join forces and do battle against an enemy that threatens global security in this rather amazing comic book adaptation. I'll be honest and admit that comic book movies aren't my #1 type of film and it wasn't until just a month before THE AVENGERS opened that I bothered to check out the casts supporting movies. I enjoyed the two IRON MAN movies, thought THOR was very good, THE INCREDIBLE HULK was entertaining and I found CAPTAIN America to be decent but no matter what I felt about those films it couldn't prepare me for how much I enjoyed this one. Director Joss Whedon has created something incredibly special and you really can't help but think he's raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it. When bringing all of these characters together, the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasn't the case here as Whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it. The constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another. This banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great one-liners as well as some terrific action. When it comes to these type of movies I usually complain about a couple things. One is the obvious CGI but that wasn't a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it. Another thing I usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times. THE AVENGERS clocks in at 142-minutes, which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does. In fact, the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems. Say what you will about comic adaptations but there's no question that THE AVENGERS is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction, the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life. This here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up.","

"The Avengers","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","7 May 2012","For the past four years, Marvel Studios has been building a cinematic mythology based on their comic books, for the first time combining different franchises into a single canonical movie-universe. Starting in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"", to 2010's ""Iron Man 2"" and finally last year's ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"", there have been five films building in anticipation to this result- the ultimate crossover experience. In addition to those four heroes, we are also given Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury, bringing our team of heroes to about seven. (Although Fury isn't a direct player, so I suppose the team stands at six)This movie had a lot to live up to.It succeeded. By god, this was an awesome movie!Directed and co-written by Joss Whedon, 2012's ""The Avengers"" is perfect payoff for fans who have been anticipating this film for over four years now.Beginning with Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arriving at a SHIELD HQ, the Tesseract (the Asgard artifact used by Red Skull in last year's ""Captain America), which has been under lock-down for testing, opens a portal, allowing Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the outcast brother of Thor to arrive on Earth. He steals the Tesseract and uses his powers to brainwash several SHIELD members (including Hawkeye, portrayed by Jeremy Renner). It is revealed that Loki needs to the Tesseract to open a portal to allow an alien race to invade and conquer Earth.Realizing they are in over their heads, Fury calls out to unite the three Earthly heroes- Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans). After the team apprehends Loki, his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is sent back to Earth, completing our team.When Loki escapes and is finally able to open the portal, the four heroes (joined by Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow and a redeemed Hawkeye) must band together, despite their differences, to defend the world in an ultimate battle.The acting in this film is outstanding. This really begins with our four leads. There is no need to speak about Downey, he continues to play the role to perfection. Hemsworth and Evans also are given a lot of good material to work with. In particular Evans, who gives the character of Steve Rogers subtle pain and pathos this time around despite having to be strong. But the real revelation is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I thought both Eric Bana and Edward Norton had given fine, first-class performances. Particularly Norton, who really made the role his own in a big way. But Ruffalo surprisingly blows them both out of the water. He makes the role of Bruce Banner (and the Hulk thanks to motion-capture technology) his own, giving him humor and an incredible depth. Ruffalo is OWED his own Hulk movie now.In addition the supporting performances are incredible. The gorgeous Johansson is given a lot more to do in this film, and she breaths a great life into Black Widow. To be honest, Black Widow was at times more compelling than our four leads, and Johansson proves once again to be a phenomenal actress. Clark Gregg reprises his ""Iron Man"" and ""Thor"" role as SHIELD agent Phil Coulson, and provides some great comedic moments, in addition to being the shady government type. Hiddleston is menacing and dark as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard and Gwenyth Paltrow return in small roles as Erik Selvig and Pepper Potts, and although their scenes are minor, both ground the film emotionally. The only slight problem I had was with Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. I will say, he gave a fine performance, but his role seemed... somewhat underwritten in comparison with everyone else. He felt a little too expendable a character and shoe-horned in. But Renner was still good in the role.The script by Whedon (from a story he co-wrote with Zak Penn) is tight, concise and an absolute blast. There is a lot of humor (and I do mean a lot) and a ton of action, although it never feels forced, contrived or unneeded. As fantastical as the story is, it is grounded in it's own sort of reality and logic, and feels natural. This is an extremely well-written, fun and generally light-hearted film.The visuals are a blast. Whedon's direction and camera placement is fun, kinetic and serves as a good companion piece to the other four directors who had previously helmed the individual films. The effects are outstanding. The sound design is great. The score by Alan Silvestri is fun and memorable.This is just a competently made film, and a darned-fine piece of entertainment!I will say that this isn't necessarily the best film in the series (I think the first ""Iron Man"" felt a tad more fresh and unique), but this is still an absolute blast, and you cannot afford to miss it on the big screen!I give ""The Avengers"" a near-perfect 9 out of 10! Assemble in line at the cinema and see it, now!","

"The Avengers","sanddragon939","27 April 2012","From the moment Samuel L Jackson walked in during the post-credits scene of 'Iron Man' four years ago, talking about the 'Avengers Initiative', the whole world has waited for this epic assemblage of some of Marvel's greatest icons! Well, four years and five films later, the Avengers have finally assembled...and, as expected, it was with a wave of sheer awesomeness!Unlike the previous 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' films, 'The Avengers' isn't really into complex plotting here. The premise is simple-Loki, the Asgardian 'God', seeks to facilitate the invasion of Earth by an alien race...and Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD, responds by activating the 'Avengers Initiative', bringing together armored hero Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. reprising the character for the third time), Loki's 'brother' and Asgardian warrior Thor (Chris Helmsworth), the living legend and man out of time Captain America (Chris Evans), gamma radiations expert Dr. Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego the 'Hulk' (both played to perfection by Mark Ruffalo, following in the footsteps of Edward Norton) and clandestine operatives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). What follows is the usual hero vs. villain fare...albeit on a scale about a BILLION times larger than that of, say, 'Spiderman'. Indeed, one of the greatest moments in the film is a single shot that sweeps across New York City, taken in the battles of each of the six Avengers across the breadth of the Big Apple...a testament to the sheer scale and scope of not only the film itself, but the threat faced by the heroes in-universe.Action and spectacles aside, 'The Avengers' real strength lies in the characterizations of the core characters. Downey Jr. turns in another memorable performance as Tony Stark which was to be expected, and Tom Hiddleton brilliantly essays the megalomaniacal God Loki...but it is newcomer (to the Marvel movie-verse) Mark Ruffalo who really stands out in his dual performance as both scientific genius Bruce Banner and the rampaging Hulk. Ruffalo brings a level of depth to the character, and his inner struggles, which was not immediately evident in performances by previous actors. His Banner is not so much a man on the run from the monster within as he is a man who is starting to learn to accept the monster and use it as a force for good. Samuel L Jackson really gets to shine here as Nick Fury, after his cameos in previous films.On a parting note, there has been an unfortunate tendency, for months, on message boards, blogs and forums across the Internet, to create some kind of a 'competition' between The Avengers and Nolan's upcoming epic, The Dark Knight Rises. Having seen the former, I can safely say that such comparisons are totally uncalled for. The Avengers is not aiming to surpass The Dark Knight Rises any more than Star Wars was aiming to surpass The Godfather. They are two totally different films, belonging to different genres and (literally) whole different universes, and as fans, we need to respect that above all else and enjoy all masterpieces on their own merits!","

"The Avengers","OllieSuave-007","18 November 2013","This is an OK superhero flick featuring the Marvel Comics heroes Thor, Ironman, The Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. They are assigned to protect the entire globe from Loki, the stepbrother of Thor, and an alien invasion.There are plenty of enjoyable action is this movie, helped with some slapstick humor. The action sequences, especially during the climax, were breathtaking and exciting, leaving the audience thoroughly entertained. However, the movie's main plot and story aren't very captivating or compelling, coupled with lack of chemistry and substance between the cast of characters.I would like to have seen every superhero in this movie given a more elaborative purpose and equal screen time; it appeared that Ironman was the main focus of the movie and took away most of the glory - too much emphasis was placed on the character. Robert Downey Jr. was too cocky and tried too hard to be funny in the Ironman role.Overall, this movie is just one battle scene after the other. Not much of a story here, but it's something the kids would love to watch.Grade C","

"The Avengers","jon.h.ochiai","7 May 2012","Back on Earth through time and space, imperially arrogant god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) says, ""Freedom is the great lie"" Thor's half brother will make the world his new kingdom. The brave souls, who stand in his path, are The Avengers. Director and Writer Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" convincingly assembles solo superheroes and super egos to battle Loki and his alien minions in one of the year's best movies. Think of Whedon as Coach Phil Jackson, but for superheroes. Robert Downey Jr. as brash Tony Stark threatens Norse god Loki, ""If we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it."" ""The Avengers"" is awesome.The classic hero story requires a commanding villain, and that is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston is charismatic evil and sympathetic sadness. He evokes certain pathos for Loki, feeling betrayed by his foil half brother Thor, strong and compassionate Chris Hemsworth. Thor fights with all his might against his brother, out of love and honor. Blond maned and shredded Hemsworth balances aloof charm and conviction as Thor. Whedon's ""The Avengers"" is timelessly inspiring: We believe in heroes who believe in themselves and others and would sacrifice their lives for the noble and just cause. I think the captivating leads of ""The Avengers"" are Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. Downey Jr. brilliantly hides beneath Iron Man's Tony Stark's cynical narcissistic veneer, a caring man wiser than his smart ass punch lines. Evans is surprising. Aside from looking amazingly chiseled he embodies in Steve Rogers (Captain America) a self doubting relevance, while the inspired leader emerges. His Rogers is the frozen super soldier who awakens 70 years later into a new war.The cool Stark and the solid Rogers clash passionately. Stark mourns a fallen friend. Rogers asks if this is the first time he has lost a soldier. Stark screams, ""We are not soldiers!"" Whedon and Zak Pen's story is kinetically driven, with the foundation laid in character. Powerful egos and intentions must coalesce and foster value and respect—as some sort of functional family tasked with saving the world.Whedon generates amazing performances, and infuses welcome wit and humor. To that end, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Director of the clandestine S.H.I.E.L.D., maybe the sinuous plot device. After making a career of cameos in previous Marvel superhero movies, Jackson fleshes out his bad ass Fury. He brings a refreshing gruff self awareness, after all The Avengers was his initiative so that these heroes would fight the fight we couldn't. However, is he the tough love patriot or calculated manipulator? Jackson cannily walks that fine line. Beautiful and idealist Cobie Smulders as loyal Agent Hill is Fury's social conscience. Stark, Rogers, and Dr. Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discern Fury's possible other motives shrouded in National Security.Exiled Loki brokers an alliance with the warrior alien race, the Chitauri. The Chitauri will let him rule Earth, if he brings them the Tesseract (Hyper Cube). The Tesseract harnesses the power of the galaxy, and is mysteriously tied to both Thor and Captain America. Loki uses the Tesseract to escape exile and breach S.H.I.E.L.D. Obtaining Tesseract, he brainwashes brave Agent Hawkeye (solid Jeremy Renner). Loki has a grand scheme. Expert straight man Clark Gregg as reliable Agent Coulson must call upon the team to protect the world. Scarlett Johansson is hot and deadly as Agent Natasha (Black Widow). She dispatches Russian mafia captors with Muay Thai and jujitsu in Jason Statham like style. She heads off to Calcutta to find Dr. Bruce Banner, and his raging green alter ego The Hulk. Ruffalo adds an understated brilliance and goofy charm that humanizes. We really believe that he has made his peace and controlled the ""other guy"". Coulson calls upon Stark (Downey Jr.), who is in the midst of clean power sourcing his Stark Tower. Stark has a playful relationship with his partner Pepper Potts (funny and beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow). Too bad Paltrow isn't leveraged more in ""The Avengers"".Of course assembling a bunch of super powered heroes is not immediate team building. Whedon orchestrates spectacular clashes amongst themselves. Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America battling in the dark forest is visually stunning. The Hulk taking on Thor is wild and strangely comical. The Hulk gets the prize for his cage match with evil Loki. The audience exploded in applause. Ruffalo is amazing. His casual nerd nicely bonds with Downey Jr.'s impatient genius. Renner as Hawkeye is solid and edgy, and plays nice. Johansson looks awesome in the black body suit. Even more impressive she shades the darkness and nobility of Natasha. She has a killer scene with Hiddleston at the story arc.""The Avengers"" delivers with the explosive visual spectacle as our heroes risk their lives battling the powerful aliens as they pulverize New York City. Whedon is masterful with the action and the characters. He makes us believe in heroes in ""The Avengers"".","

"The Avengers","BA_Harrison","21 April 2014","Having already starred in their own standalone movies, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, taking over the role from Edward Norton), Captain America (Chris Evans), and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) team up with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to form The Avengers, a team of superheroes-operating under the command of Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson)-who are called upon to battle evil Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) when he threatens to invade the planet with his Chitauri army.The Avengers made an absolute mint at the box-office, proving to me that a large percentage of cinema-goers aren't all that fussed about an innovative or intelligible script just so long as they get plenty of bang for their buck. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, The Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is an unnecessarily convoluted superhero blockbuster wrapped around the most tired of premises: an evil being seeking a mystical energy source that will give him the power to rule the world. This trite set-up allows for countless effects filled battles during which no-one suffers anything more than a bruised ego.An impressive line-up of Hollywood A-listers and the most spectacular state-of-the-art CGI effects money can buy do not alter the fact that this is predictable, clichéd nonsense told with little style, coherence or originality.","

"The Avengers","chera_khalid","2 October 2023","The Avengers, a superhero symphony that had me fist-pumping like a Marvel fanatic. The ensemble cast, from Robert Downey Jr.'s snarky Tony Stark to Scarlett Johansson's kick-ass Black Widow, is a powerhouse of charisma and chemistry, each hero shining in their own right. The film editing is a whirlwind of action, seamlessly interweaving larger-than-life battles with character-driven moments that give the narrative heart. Strengths? The seamless blending of individual hero stories into a cohesive team dynamic, a superhero jigsaw puzzle that fits together flawlessly. Weaknesses? Occasionally, the plot might hover on the edge of over-the-top, but hey, it's a superhero extravaganza, and we love it that way. The music, Alan Silvestri's score, is the pulse of heroism, swelling with each iconic entrance and saving the world crescendo. Cinematography captures the grandeur of the Marvel universe, from the soaring heights of Stark Tower to the depths of Loki's mischief. The message? A celebration of teamwork, diversity, and the idea that even the most disparate heroes can come together for the greater good. 8/10 is a superhero salute to its exhilarating entertainment, a film that not only assembles Earth's mightiest heroes but also assembles a solid spot in the pantheon of superhero epics.","

"The Avengers","classicsoncall","5 May 2012","Well how do I put this across so it doesn't sound like I'm trying to trash the movie? I've been around since Stan Lee created Spider-Man, and some of the other Marvel super-heroes were around even before I was born. So I grew up at a time when the technology wasn't up to the task of putting what we see in today's Avengers on the big screen. With that said, it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak. The CGI and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle, so if that's what you're all about, you won't be disappointed. However if you're looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot, you've come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for. So on that score it works, but I need something more, even in a super-hero movie.With that out of the way, there were some genuinely funny moments in the picture that added the slightest dimension to the principal characters. Of all the players, Robert Downey Jr. probably brings the greatest sense of professionalism to his portrayal of Iron Man. He's out there, he's serious when he has to be, and he's a wise guy when the situation warrants. As for the the CGI Hulk - who ever thought he'd wind up being the comedic sidekick in a story like this? He had at least two stellar moments that brought my theater to life, the rag doll whipping on old Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and the sidearm swat to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that was so outrageous it just brought the house down.Apart from some of the witty comic book dialog, the rest was all relentless and gratuitously destructive special effects, exceptionally well done of course, but gosh, how much can a city take? Which by the way, is never dealt with as part of the aftermath of a super-hero barrage when a cosmic power like Loki comes to town. How about a film where citizen action groups bring charges against Iron Man, Thor and Hulk for destroying their city? Just kidding - how are you going to get them to court? Say, I know Stan Lee missed a cameo or two along the way in these Marvel flicks, so I was glad to see he showed up here, even though it was probably his quickest one ever. If you blinked you missed it during the cable news roundup following the final battle. It's going to be a sad day when Lee won't be around any more to make these appearances.And now for my final rant - as I write this, ""The Avengers"" has, in just two days, made it to #31 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Films. My post will be #495, so in less than a full weekend, movie goers have vaulted this film to a rating right up there in between ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this picture? Personally, if I were making the rules, I'd allow all the reviews in the world right out of the gate for a new release, but withhold ratings on a picture for at least a year or two after it's come out. OK, maybe six months. I think that would take some of the distortion out of the rating system, and someone like Joss Whedon wouldn't have to go around being embarrassed by comparisons to truly great films.Back to ""The Avengers"" - stick around for the closing credits for a preview of the next mind blowing Avengers flick. You know they'll be there because Nick Fury said so. THANOS!!! You think they can destroy more property than you saw done in this film? I'd bet on it.","

"The Avengers","Kane20","1 July 2012","I saw The Avengers on May 17. Personally, I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I quite enjoyed the movie. In my opinion, The Avengers is a pretty good and entertaining movie, and it's a good theatrical experience. James Berardinelli wrote in his review, ""The Avengers kicks ass."" I agree.Over the last few years, five movies have been made - Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and Captain America - which have built up to, and became prequels to, The Avengers. There were even things in those movies that hinted at them all being connected, and now this movie confirms it. The Avengers are all assembled in this film: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, the Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Yes, they're all played by the same actors, and they have the backgrounds that have been established for most of them in the ""prequels"" mentioned above. The villain in the movie is Loki, who was the villain in Thor, and who now plans on using the Tesseract, a powerful energy cube, to open a portal to another part of the universe and attack the earth with a powerful army. The Avengers are called together by Nick Fury, who runs an agency called S. H. I. E. L. D., and they must stop Loki from carrying out his plans. There's more to the story, but I won't give any more away.I'm sure there are things that can be criticized about the movie. However, it's really not worth it, given there are so many good things about the movie, and the entire experience is very enjoyable, so I'm not going to bother with an in-depth review/criticism. In a way, the film is sort of critic-proof (for lack of a better term). So here's my advice: don't dissect or overly analyze the movie. Just sit back and enjoy it. That's not to say that it's a total Transformers-like junk movie or anything. It's actually halfway decent.The actors put on a good performance and really bring out their characters, and the interactions between the characters are good - the gathering of the different superheroes is handled pretty well. The story is pretty solid, and it's coherent and appropriately paced. The visual and special effects and action scenes are great. Alan Silvestri composed an effective score for the movie. Overall, the movie is halfway decent, it's smart, and it's entertaining, and, unlike many junk films like Michael Bay's, it actually allows for sufficient blockbuster emotional involvement, and it has a good, wise balance between story and action/effects. The two-and-a-half hour running length of the movie pretty much zipped by for me. So, while I don't think this movie is great, it's definitely entertaining and worth seeing, and it's a very good theater experience.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)","

"The Avengers","prashanta_guha","7 May 2012","Let's be honest. All the previous Marvel films leading to the Avengers were great - story wise, acting wise, effect wise etc. Iron Man I & II, Thor, Captain America all turned out to be (surprise) box office hits, and one can see the point. So, when at the end of every movie, a post credits scene was shown depicting that there is something even greater planned, the expectations were raised pretty high.Joss Whedon (Firefly, Cabin in the Woods) took into account that set expectations, of both comic book fans and non-fans alike, and put together a superhero flick that'll rest proudly as the conclusion to its predecessors. The screenplay writers, the VFX studio, the actors (Robert Downey Jr. has always been my favorite) all deserve credit.An action packed, blockbuster movie that already has every record broken and every voice cheering, The Avengers is one of the best movies this year. A must watch, even if you're not into this stuff. 10 on 10.","

"The Avengers","snoozejonc","10 May 2021","Loki attempts to enslave planet Earth.This is an entertaining movie with impressive spectacle and solid character moments.The plot for me is okay, as Loki and the Chitari never truly feel like a plausible threat. However, the character time it gives to various superheroes is exceptionally good.Putting so many comic book characters on the stage at the same time is a difficult concept, but this is done well with some excellent dialogue and creative uses of their powers in various situations. Some of the banter from characters like Black Widow, Iron Man, Loki and Captain America is wonderfully written and delivered.There are some fights that feel a bit forced to bring fanboys fantasies like Thor v Ironman or Thor v Hulk to life. However, they are admittedly fun to watch. What does get a bit much is the sheer volume of hyperkinetic CGI heavy action sequences. They are fantastically designed but for me there is too much of it. Personally I would have replaced some of this with quieter character moments but this is just a matter of taste.It goes without saying that all the visuals are high quality throughout the film. My favourite sequence is the Stuttgart scene, which is beautifully filmed, edited, scored and climaxes with some heroic posturing from the Avengers.When the Hulk goes o the rampage in the Helicarrier, there is a brilliant scene transition from him punching someone through a wall to a shot of Iron Man emerging from a similar shaped hole in a different wall.The climactic battle scene is a massive piece of spectacle and it includes some of the most impressive effects and CGI sequences in recent years. At the risk of sounding like a killjoy, some of the impressive feats of heroism performed by the Avengers do seem like they have been included for the sake of coolness, such as no look shots and other solo moves.'The Avengers' contains a number of solid performances. For me Scarlet Johansson has the most powerful screen presence and Mark Ruffalo makes a perfect Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr is as charismatic as ever, whilst Chris Evans, Chris Hemswoth, Samuel L Jackson and Jeremy Renner are all solid. Tom Hiddleston is a lot of fun as Loki.For me it is an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.","

"The Avengers","tedg","10 June 2012","From time to time, I have the gift of unique movie audiences. I've watched ""The Brady Bunch"" in an after school audience of teen and preteen LA girls. Down the road from where I live is the Pat Robertson school of film where most students believe they are in a fight with the devil and film is a most powerful tool for Jesus, and I can feel that in the response to certain films. My home theater is in the midst of a significant military area, so I sit next to warriors and their families when wondering about the war movies I see. This includes the so-called seal team six, and all the navy pilots in the mideast.But the most precious of shared dark space is when I am in Shanghai. I saw this film there, the only nonasian in the crowd — other than the 7 year old I was with. Then after a period of reflection, rewatched 'The Empire Strikes Back.'So I saw this film about the clash and merger of different worlds and dimensions while in full swim with that dynamic myself. (Chinese officials block access to IMDb, so this comment will be posted on my leaving.)The Star Wars films, the first of them anyway, demand only two extensions of the universe beyond a projection into the future. We assume that the future (or we did then) would include large machines, space travel and expanded notions of universal governance. There is no particular need to modify what we accept as the world we live in on that account. The notion of the force, and how it is woven into Jungian family dynamics was the big leap, the thing that forces us to stretch our universe. I think I understand the appeal of this across ages and cultures.The Marvel universe requires a different set of expansions. The time is now, yet we have world government and massive military machines and the same anachronistic limit on weapons. (There has been no advance in weapon technology: guns and swords.) We no longer need monsters to be designed to that actors can suit up, but even the CGI characters inherit this limit. But because they have to engage in hand-to-hand combat, we'll be asked only to assume beings more or less like us (but ugly) and big machines. They have the same notions of weapons (swords, guns, blasters) we have in both the real world and the cinematic sci-fi world.These limits ask little of us, but they limit the battles to be that same old crap we have seen hundreds of times before. The only thing Marvel could have brought was competence. Whelon does that.Where Marvel asks us to extend our universe is in the acceptance of complete, independent other worlds. These are not just different planets with the same physics, but different dimensions with (as much as the comic artists can imagine) different physics. This is a big assumption, and I suppose only a few enterprises (religious ones) can pull it off, because you have to take the space to define the different laws of the other dimensions.Marvel had a crew of different artists and writers, and they did not start out with a combined universe in mind, until a few managers until they combined several weak characters to sell more comics. (Stan Lee takes the credit for this, and I do not know the history well enough to dispute it.)So we have Tony Stark who really asks that we believe that the reach of technology will expand. We have several Marvel characters that also require only that we accept normal scientific accidents: radiation-based usually. The main disruptive device here is a crystal that asks only that we believe it emits some unknown radiation. This is only a cousin to the mysteries of the LHC. That takes care of Fury, Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. Hawk and Widow are just spies with extraordinary training (along the lines of Batman).Thor, Loki, Asgard and the creatures from yet a third dimension are what expands this. We are asked to believe in an open, manyworld universe. Not other planets (as with Superman). Not humanmastered magic (Harry Potter, the Jedi, Dr Strange), but other worlds. I credit Lewis Carroll with making this possible.Having said that, what Whelon does is allow the character interplay to be a reflection (that is, folded) commentary on these assumptions. Everyone among the 8 or so members of the team looks at and questions the worlds of the other. This is where the Chinese context comes in. I suppose in the US, Captain America is seen as partly a joke, what we shorthand as only a ""cartoon,"" but here that distinction is lost -- especially as the actor is encouraged to take his role seriously. Here, what we have is Team America taken seriously.What is seen here — and the China market for Hollywood blockbusters is as large as the US market — is a dull-witted, good-hearted American soldier taking command. He is manipulated by the government and military leaders, and supplied with the most extraordinary technology. He even — and no one should be surprised by this — has access to the powers of the other worlds. The blond hair and Germanic manner really stand out here.Oh and the redheaded girl, with the spotty past, guile and commitment to do good.I have no idea what effect this will have on global audiences. The Marvel franchise is now as powerful as that of Star Wars and Potter, and much more able to be mapped to current events. Fury even references them. But I can tell you that this was a thrilling experience, to see this with the additional fold of the audience, some of whom looked away from me when leaving the theater.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"The Avengers","Uriah43","24 December 2013","This is one of those movies that has both good points and bad points. For starters, I thought ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) and ""the Hulk"" (Mark Ruffalo) were absolutely sensational. Likewise, most of the other characters were well played too. On the flip-side though the introduction of ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) was terribly planned and presented. Not only was the character development badly mishandled but the fact that this person got so much screen time when there were others with much better credentials just boggles the mind. Not only that but his costume-or basic lack thereof-also stuck out like a sore thumb. Additionally, although I liked the CGI I thought it and the non-stop action were just too overwhelming. Even more important was the fact that there were too many characters and not enough film to go around between them. This made the film look extremely uneven. Too many cooks do indeed spoil the soup. Be that as it may, this movie should have been very good but in all frankness it turned out to be a jumbled mess. All things considered then I think the really good points were dragged down by the lack of direction which resulted in a very mediocre film. Accordingly, I rate it as only average.","

"The Avengers","emily-k-mccole","15 April 2012","I was lucky enough to be included in the group to see the advanced screening in Melbourne on the 15th of April, 2012. And, firstly, I need to say a big thank-you to Disney and Marvel Studios.Now, the film... how can I even begin to explain how I feel about this film? It is, as the title of this review says a 'comic book triumph'. I went into the film with very, very high expectations and I was not disappointed.Seeing Joss Whedon's direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor. The special effects are literally mind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and beautifully choreographed.While all of these things (script, action, special effects and so on and so forth) are important... it's no good having them spot on if you don't have a cast that just isn't right. But fortunately, for fans and for the actors involved, Whedon's cast not only work brilliantly together but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and threatening each other all day and night.The actors' performances in ""Marvel's The Avengers"" are simply captivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert Downey Jr. will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations. And Tom Hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear.All in all, Marvel's The Avengers is a visual delight and I cannot wait to see it again, and again, and again. Marvel fans will not be disappointed, and something tells me that most of you will agree with me wholeheartedly.The Avengers, assembled and awe-inspiring. Ten out of ten.","

"The Avengers","artful_mark","4 May 2012","Ugh! ""Avengers"" wore me out. Lets begin with this spoilfest review. The character I was most looking forward to being fleshed out was Hawkeye, who starts out as a zombie.... Loki has a good entrance, but his alien-buddies are never fleshed out, named, or given any character development whatsoever. Apparently, their ""advance warfare"" includes just really-drunken aerial driving. Thor was a pure letdown. He had no swagger, wasn't boisterous, and his costume changed without rhyme or reason. PLUS, he just *poof* appeared, and this killed the beautiful and tragic unrequited love ending of ""THOR"". PLUS, PLUS, he didn't even try to find Jane, or even pound her with a hailstorm or anything! Maria Hill was just annoying eye-candy whose stunning visage countered her lack of plot-points. And Captain America was lackluster. Black Widow was okay. Hulk was funny, but it was kind of creepy how he went after Black Widow. He spends half the movie telling everyone not to bring out the bad guy, then he kind of reveals in the movies silliest moment that, oh, golly gee, I can do this anytime I want to. And Pepper Potts as a daisy-duke wearing penthouse babe? I don't think so. The worst continuity of the series fell on Iron Man. At the end of ""The Incredible Hulk"", it was setup where Tony Stark was forming the Avengers, then we find out in ""The Avengers"" that he wouldn't even be accepted? No Odin, No Jane, No tender flashback scene for Cap's love-interest... I felt the movie really could have benefited from some roller-coaster ride, instead of all peaks. I was surprised to see ""Jenny Agutter"" listed in the credits, apparently she was an unnamed council-member who was so poorly lit she didn't stand out. The best part was Agent Coulson who died (wtf?). And who was the rogue pilot who took it upon himself to nuke New York? No hints at future teammates.... No real philosophic underpinnings like X-Men had... It was kind of just DisneyWorld on Crack, but it was fun to see on opening night....","

"The Avengers","martinpersson97","20 August 2021","The MCU had estavlished itself as an interesting project since the start - there were some hit and miss movies, but it was overall an imaginative concept.Then came the moment everyone had been waiting for, the big culminatiom that had been promised for years - and with Joss Wheadon at the helms, it sure doesn't disappoint.Like the MCU overall, it has a very fun and lighthearted feeling reminiscent of films like Str Wars, which is much appreciated. It is a very colourful cast of different and memorable characters, all memorized by great actors. The main antagonist Loki establishes himself as one of the most interesting and complex movie villains of all time, whether he's tragic, spiteful, mildly heroic or just pure evil, he's a joy to watch.A main draw in these movies, of course, are the effects and action scenes and they sure doesn't disappoint. The movie gives us some of the biggest and most epic scale battles ever seen on the silver screen, and it's simply mind blowing. The cinematography is incredible as well.Overall, a fun and epic movie that was years in the making and once and for all proved how successful the Marvel Cinematic Universe was.","

"The Avengers","j-pryde","25 April 2012","Although Marvel Pictures have always made curious appointments in regards to their feature film directors the results have been mostly solid, if not spectacular thus far. I certainly didn't expect Jon Faverau to deliver one of the best comic-book movies ever – Iron Man. If it wasn't for DC's own Billionaire playboy superhero would've champion Iron Man as the best flick in the genre. Yes I do rate Iron Man that highly. Spider-Man 1 & 2 were good but didn't exactly capture the essence of Peter Parker while Spider-Man 3 was a huge mess, not Mark Steven Johnson mess, but a mess nonetheless. Last year's motion picture debuts of Marvel staples Thor and Captain America were also very good, very faithful to their respective source material. Joe Johnston redeemed himself after a misguided attempt at bringing the Wolfman back to the silver screen, whereas Kenneth Branaghs Shakespeare sensitive's proved a stroke of genius in fitting Thor into Marvel's motion picture universe. To be honest I even enjoyed 2008's The Incredible Hulk after Ang Lee damn near killed the franchise.Even though Marvel Pictures has proved time and again to make the right decisions when producing a movie on its own, the hiring of Joss Whedon seemed like an odd choice. Of course Joss Whedon is the genius behind TV-cult hits like Buffy, Angel and Firefly but his only foray into directing was 2005's Serenity. Managing all those superstar egos, handling multiple character arcs, dealing with several multimillion dollar franchises and making everyone happy from top brass executive down to the hardcore fanboys – to be honest, I wouldn't have entrusted him with a fraction of the $200-million-plus budget for The Avengers. Thus far only two directors have managed to pull off the impossible and accomodated several superheroes in a single movie – Bryan Singer (X-Men & X2) and Matthew Vaughn (X-Men First Class) while Brett Ratner ruined X-Men 3 with his unfocused direction. At first I thought Joss Whedon would do an even more terrible job than the latter, considering that Ratner had more filmmaking experience than Whedon at the time of filming X3. But nothing could be further from the truth. Joss Whedon is the MASTER, with a captial M.Let me say it out loud: JOSS WHEDON IS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE GOD. Unlike Ratner he actually cares about the characters and their development throughout the movie. You think Tony Stark would just waltz through the movie and roll over every other character? You are wrong. Though Robert Downey Jr. is in top form as he always is when he dons the Iron Man suit, the other characters are far from underdeveloped and don't crumble under the pressure of his larger-than-life persona. If anything it's the Hulk that absolutely steals the show. That said, I think we have found the definitive Bruce Banner, Mark Ruffalo, he absolutely owns the role. He is the Hulk and we finally got the Hulk we deserved. Everybody brings their A-game and every character gets a fair amount of screen time. I can't find any flaw in this movie. Of course the special effects are spectacular but it's the dialogue that won me over. Really. Each character in this movie has at least one or two memorable lines – not just Tony Stark. When you watch the Avengers make sure you listen to the dialogue carefully – I've never heard dialogue this witty in any comic movie, and I've watched my fair share. Joss Whedon you are the freaking man. They said it was impossible to accommodate this many characters in a single movie – they were wrong. From now on everyone will reference this movie whenever multiple larger-than-life figures are thrown into one supersized extravaganza – Yeah I'm slamming the last two Transformers flicks. I guarantee Joss Whedon would've done justice to the franchise. After watching the Avengers everything that bears the name of Joss Whedon is a must-see for me now. Final verdict: 10 out of 10. This movie is Iron Man on steroids. Go watch that movie!!!","

"The Avengers","unbekannternutzer","21 August 2012","this is where IMDb needs to react to all those obviously faked reviews. if they don't people will just ignore all 'blockbuster'-reviews. which would call for competition that will take action against this kind of manipulation.this has never been so obvious than with the avengers. this movie does not deserve a rating above 4. the plot is uninspired and boring, has no twists and everyone knows where it's going. the dialog feels very scripted. characters in comic books for 5-year-olds maybe talk like that. superheroes don't. the acting is very unnatural, it feels very staged and no emotion is being transported to the audience. the characters aren't developed, they just get different punchlines to throw at the audience. the cgi is really bad, not worthy of a movie of 2012. i think even '2001 - A Space Odyssey' (1968) had better special effects.it seems that they spent almost all their money on the actors, forgot about the story and just used the cheapest cgi they could get. the rest of the money they used for marketing and creating a hype (as i said, this is obvious here on IMDb).the whole thing is just cheap. but we will see more of this if people continue to make this kind of movie profitable. and this will probably be the case, so expect more of these.","

"The Avengers","hendry-robert","27 January 2013","Honestly, I like the odd superhero movie but the makers of this are like the fat kid in Willy The Wonka who has to have all the chocolate. This production (sic) treats the entire audience as low IQ zombies (no offence to actual zombies intended). There is zero depth of character development and zero story line interest. At no time whatsoever do you ever feel a sense of suspense or danger. At no time do you care if any of the characters come to harm - well you kind of know that none of them will as their superheroes - obviously. And why even bother having humans with no super powers - Oh I forgot, the humans in it are the most magical, unbelievable fighting machines. They just stand there wasting anything in their path, and Im not talking about the super heroes here. Rambo is but a beginner compared to them.Every single facet of this farce is totally predictable from start to finish. Its one of those where you pray your transported to another reality and the bad guys actually win.Technically its all good except the sound department have again gone mental. The action scenes are incredibly loud and were at times quite painful on the ears (seriously) and then the speaking parts were often so whispered and muffled sounding. I'm sure during post the sound guys sit there with the best sound system money can buy - but the reality is their mix doesn't translate well across systems. Bad sound isn't the problem, its the post mixing. I hear this issue on far to many movies these days and its ruining many films.The acting by some of the cast is decent, considering the ridiculously poor script they have to work with. But in no way will any of them be remembering their part in this movie during their twilight years. This is a money and profile job - nothing more. Even then I do have to wonder if putting your name to this is actually worth it?. The directing is amateur hour. His/her (I don't know and don't care) focus is squarely on action and FX - so why not just have the FX team direct it as they certainly would have done a better job than the lucky ducky who managed to land this lucrative job. I do wonder if the director has actually ever watched a movie to see how one directs actors?Anyway, I cant say much more about this nonsense except if you enjoy a movie which is one long mind numbing boring action scene, aimed at a dumbed down populace - then this is for you.PS I cannot believe this movie gained so much favourable reviews. I certainly smell a rat.","

A totally boring, endless and mostly witless movie aimed at brain-deadened people who think that special effects, explosions and fantasy but definitely not fantastic characters make for a great movie. The cinematography was gray and cloudy, the editing incomprehensible, and the acting unsurprising and depressingly familiar. Simple, human emotions, which used to be integral to a movie are now so rare. Noise and all-too-familiar mayhem have been substituted. The attention span of the audience, when not being bombarded by yet another special effect, shifts quickly to their cell phone when things slow down even a bit. To think that more-of-the-same will be the order of the day is depressing. Count me out.","

Spiderman (1-3), Dark Knight, Super 8, Iron Man(1-2), Transformers(1-2)I really don't dislike that many movies. I'm not being cynical. This movie really is just a cluster ..... There's no emotion to the whole thing. Its dull and flat. It also feels very ""PG""Its the definition of cliché when it comes to super hero movies. There's no bar being raised, there is nothing new being done. The entire script is just a bunch of predictable non sense jargon with no meaning. There's no event in the movie where i go wow, that is original. Or go wow this movie gives me emotion and it really immerses me in the experience(Watch the beginning of star trek).My only thoughts is that Walt Disney Pictures did black hat tactics to hype this movie through social networks. I cannot and will not believe people think this movie is worth an 8.8.I really did want to walk out of the theater. This movie is forgettable and I was very disappointed and let down. This movie really just feels like another ""average"" super hero movie. But the expectation of it being good just makes it worse.","

"The Avengers","rachel-673-19946","27 April 2012","This, friends, is the comic book movie that all other comic book movies wish they could be. It's the pinnacle, the ultimate, the surely unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre, a grand adventure full of humor, action, tension, fan service and an undeniable pathos. For anyone fearing that all the hype – years and years worth of hype – might cheapen or otherwise overshadow the final outcome, you may at last be at ease. Because the JOSS WHEDON! AVENGERS MOVIE! is exactly as good as we all hoped it could be.Maybe even better.The Avengers, of course, are a superhero team made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Other heroes have come and gone amongst this happy few, in comic form, but here all you need to know is that this film serves as kind of a sequel to previous Marvel movies IRON MAN(both 1 and 2), THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America, bringing the billionaire Tony Stark, the scientist Bruce Banner, the demigod Thor and the recently defrosted World War II veteran Steve Rogers together to fight against an invading alien threat, alongside spies Clint Barton (Jeremy Denner) and Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) and under the auspices of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.Man, it's awesome. AWE. SOME.Oh, it's by no means a perfect film. Whedon is perhaps just a shade too in love with S.H.I.E.L.D technology, and the weight of portent which is given to some truly innocuous lines – especially the final line – feels a little off-kilter. Flashing up a computer image of Natalie Portman's Jane (Thor's love interest from his movie) felt a little like an apology, and the shadowy government hacks who attempt to control Nick Fury are by-the-numbers backroom power players of the Cigarette Smoking Man-school, ruthless and annoyingly cliché.Everything else, though? Simply, outstandingly, without a shadow of a doubt incredible.Just for fun, let's talk acting. All our returning superheroes reprise their roles with ease, Downey Jr. once again a delight as the arrogant billionaire Stark and Evans stoic and earnest as the displaced Cap. The award for Most Improved has to go to Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor is given a chance to rock some deadpan wit here, and rock it he surprisingly does. Johansson, of course, is gorgeous and ass-kicking as ever in her Black Widow leather, but is happily also given new levels of intriguing backstory at which to hint and play out, and her friend Hawkeye is given somewhat more to do here than he was allowed in Thor, Jeremy Renner's relaxed performance once again worthy of my beloved marksman's bow and arrow. Clark Gregg's mild-mannered Agent Coulson is adorable in his hero worship; meanwhile our main antagonist in this film is Loki, Thor's resentful trickster brother once again played with consummate creepy cool by Tom Hiddleston.Oh, and hello again Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts! Aren't you funny and great?Of the newcomers, I will admit to having had some reservations about Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, as I had been a true devotee of Edward Norton's turn in the role, but I am big enough to admit when I am wrong: he was terrific here as the mousey, mild-mannered science guy with a chip on his shoulder, and the uses to which his Hulk was put throughout the course of this movie have almost entirely changed my mind about his place in the Marvel Universe. It was that good. Elsewhere, How I Met Your Mother's Cobie Smulders, as an agent of S. H. I. E. L. D., did a lot with a little – enough to hope we see more of her lithe and loyal lieutenant character in AVENGERS 2.Indeed, after a rollicking, outrageous, hilarious outing like this one, who wouldn't already be eagerly awaiting a sequel? It is, unequivocally, the best comic book movie I have ever seen (and I've seen, well, all of them). More than that, it is my favorite movie so far this year – whew! I was so hoping BATTLESHIP wouldn't continue to hold that title for too much longer – and one I cannot wait to see again.Avengers assemble, they say? Audience assemble, I say! And assemble, and assemble, and assemble again(And make sure you stay through the credits for the now-expected next-movie teaser Buffy and Angel fans will be particularly happy, even if they don't quite get the somewhat obscure comic-y reference)-- This review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine - www.geekspeakmagazine.com","

"The Avengers","poe426","1 October 2012","Without a doubt, THE AVENGERS is the most expensive video game ever produced; why the techs would want to try to integrate live-action elements, however, is beyond me: the cartoon was okay without them. Robert Downey has the best lines (half a dozen one-liners, to be precise), though Thor's contention that Loki ""was adopted"" was just as funny. Sam Jackson looks just plain bored throughout- which is saying a lot when one considers the fact that he's the most overrated actor in Hollywood. You know a movie's heavily padded when fully one-third of it could be cut and never missed: the first third of this game is mind-numbingly clichéd and plays out like yet another pseudo-military video game (what used to be called ""first-person shooter"" games but are nowadays referred to as ""first-person action"" games) or television show the likes of which we've seen a thousand times. The skrull at the end was a nice little touch, but I wonder why comics- and now their celluloid incarnations- tend to focus on alien invasions for their ""big get-togethers"" when there are more than enough wannabe tyrants here on Earth...? I think John Carpenter (THEY LIVE) and George Romero (LAND OF THE DEAD) had it right: we have seen The Enemy, and He is Us. Give me RODNEY CECIL, PSYCHO HERO any day.","

"The Avengers","Squaremaster316","24 April 2016","*Spoilers*Just when Comic book films were truly starting to enjoy a time of true artistic relevance and seemed to be on the verge of officially casting off the shackles of stereotypes and bias that have plagued the genre for decades, along comes a film to firmly entrench it in every single hackneyed cliché and trope that have been the deservedly derided by the educated community.The Avengers is, by far, the most uninspired CBM story I've seen from the CBM genre to date, disguised by draping a cheap, easily exploitable crossover gimmick over it, not so dissimilar to the various other poorly conceived amalgamations that have been presented to us over the years in various mediums (Cartoon All Stars, AVP, Freddy v Jason, and, most recently, Dawn of Justice).Poorly executed, nonsensical characterization (""i'm Always Angry"", basically the 2012 version of ""Your mother's name is Martha too?""), forced interactions and stock 'argument' dialogue (We're not a team, we're a time bomb."", subtle.), and a total lack of dramatic heft give a very light (story-wise, not tone), one-note, TV episodic feeling to what should have been a complex, multi- layered epic.Overall, a conglomeration of ""fanboy"" moments vainly stitched together to attempt some sort of narrative.","

"The Avengers","sacflyzone","16 April 2012","Yep, Marvel has done it again but this time to the max! You can rest assured that Avengers is an absolutely amazing movie. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. (Sony pooping on Ghost Rider again this very year is a great reminder of that) Avengers is, without a doubt, their best effort yet! Personally, I think they set the bar leading up to this movie and they just clean blew the bar in to orbit with this movie.Avengers really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. They along with a select few others reinvented epic adventure as this century began by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Nolan did this for Batman and Raimi for Spider-Man. They pulled it off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them. Favreau, Branagh and Johnston did similar good work for Marvel leading up to this gem. Now, Joss Whedon not only continues that tone but adds to the work that's come before. It's like the ultimate team work and Whedon brings it all home and all together perfectly. Like the great films of the past, he grounds the action and the superhero concept in firm reality. The humor and acknowledging the absurd nature of everything we see adds the perfect flavor. Yet, all the character depth and relationship nuances are fleshed out well as with any other good film.I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Avengers delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt one of my top 10 movies of 2012, quite possibly THE best regardless of genre. I don't see anything changing that for the rest of the year. This movie is just that good","

"The Avengers","DarthVoorhees","29 May 2012","'The Avengers' is a brilliant cartoon with tremendous flair, style, and more than it's share of silliness. Director Joss Whedon is allowed free reign to present a massive spectacle of action and destruction and it is often very visually spectacular and often more than fun. Is 'The Avengers' the comic book masterpiece awaited for years by geeks everywhere? No. It isn't even Marvel's best offering as an independent studio. The only level 'The Avengers' really succeeds on is being a huge cartoon. It offers nothing truly unique in realm of dealing with these characters or their mythology. If the modern day comic book is a romanticized colorful dissection of hero worship and good and evil as I and a great many comic book fans like to think it is than Joss Whedon has ultimately failed in respecting that and using it to give his audiences something to chew on. In a great many ways I found myself brought back to the horrendous experience last summer of watching another huge action spectacle, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'. 'The Avengers' is in many ways the same movie, neither have any sense of stakes other than to make sequels. Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor are here to sell toys and tickets.Epicness is what is on the table in this film and Joss Whedon surely does deliver an epic action packed film. Delivering an action packed film isn't all that hard to do though. There are no stakes to 'The Avengers'. Missing is a sense of dread and threat. I wanted our heroes to really be tested by something bigger than themselves and they aren't. I sing the praises of Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' and you know what Jon Favreau's first 'Iron Man' film because they truly brought our characters to a point where they had to question what made them heroes and if being a hero was more than just paraphernalia. Both films created tremendously strong villains which served as representations of all that could be corrupted and made evil within the title heroes. The threat in 'The Avengers' comes in the form of a pretty lame mcguffin. We find out next to nothing about the tesseract cube other than it can blow stuff up in a Michael Bay-esque fashion. The threat to our heroes is pretty dull and lackluster. Often our heroes have to spend time reminding us they are saving the world because we forget. I wanted to be reminded that our heroes bleed and can die. Kill off a sacrificial lamb and keep me interested. (I know the retort here about Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson and he is a very fun character but he merely serves as a second rate sidekick)I think every actor in here is having a blast in their roles and I love seeing it. I don't necessarily think they are all taking their roles seriously but I do think they are engaging all the great things that make these characters pulp icons. My favorite performance has to be Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Loki isn't all that rounded a villain or character but Hiddleston loves the comic book nature of the character. Saying you want to take over the world often is a silly empty threat and yet if someone says it the right way it is fun.The final battle scene is grand as promised. Is it fun? Yes. That is something I do want to reiterate because the film is fun. There is something to be said about enjoying eye candy and things blowing up. 'The Avengers' is a masterpiece if that is what we are concerned with. Does the battle go on too long? I didn't check my watch nearly as much as I did during 'Dark of the Moon' but yes it is drawn out. I think I wouldn't feel this way though had the problems mentioned earlier been addressed. The chitauri are just plot pieces and even though we see our heroes take some hits never do we see any real toil this has on them. What is 'The Avengers'? A cartoon. The kid in me was satisfied with all the action but the adult in me wanted more.I think with 'The Avengers' we have a cinematic Rorschach with everyone getting something they want out of it and rating it much higher than it truly deserves. I saw it opening weekend and have pondered over it amidst the fanfare. Is it a good film? Yes, if you hold it up as a summer blockbuster it is an exceptional fun filled ride. Is it a substantive film? No, if you want a substantive comic book film than see 'The Dark Knight' or 'Iron Man'.","

"The Avengers","brefane","9 June 2012","Loud and overlong with minimal character and plot development and casual banter among the characters that feels more like a run through. Likewise, the conflict and plot don't really seem to matter, and there is no tension, suspense or pacing. Each scene is on same level as the one before; you could watch this film with the scenes arranged in virtually any order. This thing totally lacks momentum. The expensive cast does well enough, but the film's length and one-dimensional plot grows tiresome and the noisy soundtrack seems designed to prevent dozing. The Avengers is not particularly recommendable, nothing about it is memorable or original and it's not a film I feel any need to revisit. It's a passable time killer; nothing more.","

The movie gives each character a good amount of screen time and makes you care for them and be interested to watch them grow and succeed. The villain is also amazing as he is extremely funny and very clever by using each avengers weakness against them and the team making the team fight each other causing good action and good story telling. The movie is a relatively simple story in the long run but it is still perfectly made, funny and has great characters that are all given some form of development.","

"The Avengers","darkraven_109","28 April 2012","I can not say anything more about THE AVENGERS; the movie just hit all the right spots and a lot more. It didn't only entertain like how a brainless popcorn movie would; it told a great superhero team story.The characters were written perfectly, the action was spectacular and best of all ever character was a joy to watch. The story had the perfect balance of comedy, action and drama (yes, there's a bit of that too and it's good). It's everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movie.Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got the right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like ""IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,"" your fears will be washed away. Mark Ruffalo also stole the show as Banner/ The Hulk; if you had a few doubts about him playing the character after Edward Norton was left behind, fear not since he does the job well. I can go as far as saying that Ruffalo is the best incarnation of Banner so far. Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation. He created what I consider the best superhero movie so far. He made THE AVENGERS.To say anything more would be a waste of time. Just go and watch it.","

"The Avengers","grantss","28 August 2015","Your typical modern action movie: all style, no substance. Plot is close to non-existent, or, at least, incomprehensible. Very jumbled, entirely because the writers wanted to somehow meld all the individual Avenger stories into one story. Makes for a contrived mess.As expected, the special effects and action sequences are good. Hard to compliment performances in an action movie, as there is very little real acting involved. However, Robert Downey Jr puts in a show- stealing performance.On the whole, vastly over-rated (and this is probably a sign of how dumbed-down the general population is with regard to expectations for movies). The only positive thing I can say is: it's better than Transformers, but that says very little.","

"The Avengers","tareqzaghal","2 September 2023","Probably the most important blockbuster of the 21st century so far. This generation's Star Wars (1977). A cultural landmark that proved individual stories serving a unifying purpose can be told within a cinematic universe, a feat that many studios have tried to replicate but failed, and something that the MCU struggles with today.The biggest challenge that The Avengers (2012) would face is having to balance the immense stardom that comes with the previous five films, which all lead up to this moment. A moment that would make or break the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the moment when six individual and leading multi-layered superhero characters would share the silver screen together for the first time.What makes this film work so well is Joss Whedon's screenplay, a highlight of the film that respects and values each character, their motivations, and their overall arcs. Even all the jokes, iconic lines, and quips feel organic and true to each persona. The lab scene where all the main characters present argue and clash over different things beautifully captures the perfect synergy between the different characters. It's my favourite scene in the film and probably the most well-written one in the MCU, which establishes so much in so little time.From a technical aspect, the visual effects are still as remarkable as they were ten years ago when I first saw the film. Hulk's design is drastically improved from his stand-alone feature and is my favourite incarnation of the character in the MCU. Stark's suits always look incredible and it's a shame that in Infinity War and Endgame, they are less practical and just worse. Captain America's suit is goofy as hell, and overall, the other visuals or designs do not stand out, but the film does choose to take a safe, bright, well-light approach to its cinematography and aesthetic, instead of a specific look.There's nothing I don't like about the film, and there's undoubtedly a lot of nostalgia packed into it at this point, but it always feels fresh and exciting whenever I see any scene. The one shot during the battle of New York is one of the most glorious comic book film moments ever. You just can't not have fun with this film.","

"The Avengers","rexmatthewj","13 March 2023","""The Avengers"" is a 2012 adventure/action film directed by Joss Whedon and starring an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. The movie follows these superheroes as they come together to save the world from an alien invasion led by the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston).One of the strongest aspects of the movie is the chemistry between the cast. Each actor brings their own unique take on their character, and their interactions with one another are both humorous and engaging. The film's action scenes are also impressive, with a mix of practical and digital effects used to create thrilling set pieces.The plot is well-crafted and engaging, with a good balance between action, character development, and humor. The movie does a great job of juggling its large ensemble cast, giving each character their own moment to shine while also moving the overall plot forward.The direction by Whedon is confident and assured, with a strong visual style and a keen sense of pacing. The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is also impressive, with a mix of handheld shots and steady compositions that give the film a sense of energy and momentum.The musical score by Alan Silvestri is a standout, with a memorable main theme and well-placed motifs that help to elevate the film's emotional moments.However, the film's villain, Loki, can feel somewhat underdeveloped at times. While Tom Hiddleston brings a sense of charisma and wit to the role, the character's motivations and backstory are not always clear, making him a somewhat one-dimensional antagonist.Overall, ""The Avengers"" is an entertaining adventure/action movie that succeeds in bringing together some of Marvel's most beloved characters on the big screen. With strong performances, impressive action scenes, and a well-crafted plot, it is a highlight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a must-see for fans of the franchise.","

"The Avengers","DAZINPARIS","11 May 2012","Here's why ""The Avengers"" fails so badly.1. Wrong, wrong director - Joss Whedon is a TV Director. ""Serenity"" worked because it was essentially a TV movie. And he has here made ""The Avengers"" a TV movie. Bad move, this should have gone to J.J. Abrams, Bryan Singer or Brad Bird.2. Dreadful miscasting - only Robert Downey Junior can hold his head high. Chris Evans is as wooden in this as the flat ""Captain America"" film. Those playing Thor, Hulk, Black Widow either phone in performances or look embarrassed.3. Weak, weak villain - Tom Hiddleston plays a slight, camp character who offers little panache or interest and more closely resembles a spoiled teenager than anything else. This film needed a ""General Zod"".4. Too much obvious CGI - come on, it's 2012, there's no excuse for the George Lucas-y effects like the flying Shield craft graphics.5. No drama, tension and a script so obviously flat that Whedon inserts misplaced self conscious quips to lighten the tone.For anyone growing up with Marvel comics in the 70's (chime with me on this), we deserved SO much more. For younger audiences, it will pass I'm sure.Really can't understand though the positive reviews. Am I alone in this ?","

"The Avengers","Anurag-Shetty","27 April 2012","Could anyone imagine that the likes of Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America(Chris Evans), Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), & Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) would come together for a movie?! Well they do, in The Avengers! The movie opens with a bang, as Loki(Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and wreaks havoc at the S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters. Loki steals the Tesseract, an energy source of unlimited potential. He puts Professor Erik Selvig(Stellan Skarsgard) & Hawkeye under his control & leaves with them. After the incident at the headquarters, Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) decides that he has to reignite the Avengers Initiative, a project that had been canceled, only recently. In comes Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff who starts recruiting superheroes to form The Avengers. First, she recruits Bruce Banner aka the Hulk who, until then, had been hiding in Calcutta, India. S.H.I.E.L.D needs Banner to check the potential of the Tesseract. The new recruit is Captain America who had been frozen for quite some time(these events took place in Captain America: The First Avenger) & woke up after being in a deep slumber for seventy years. After that, S.H.I.E.L.D recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Thor joins the gang shortly thereafter. However, before the team can take on Loki, the heroes have to solve their personal issues & cut down their giant egos & work together as a team. Problematic? Yes! Iron Man's sarcasm only seems to worsen the situation. The way he makes fun of the others is hilarious! First off, I want to say something. The Avengers is the best movie of the year, so far! Be it the story, the superhero vs. superhero battles, or the sheer epic scale of the film. Loki, is the perfect super villain who is, evil & menacing. The 3D effect in this movie is just eye popping! You will literally duck down every ten seconds. The cinematography is brilliant. The way they've shown Calcutta is authentic. The battle in New York City is outstanding! A note on the performances. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Iron Man is my most favorite character in the film. Chris Evans is impressive as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is great as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is effective as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is simply wicked as Loki. Even though he's the only villain in the movie he's pulled it off superbly. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill & Stellan Skarsgard as Selvig are superb as well. So, grab your 3D glasses, buy some popcorn, sit back & relax as you watch the most entertaining movie in recent times! Don't miss this on the big screen no matter what people! Now, let's see if The Amazing Spider-Man or The Dark Knight Rises top this one. The bar has been set very high though!","

"The Avengers","hitchcockthelegend","30 December 2012","The Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.Asgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.I have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.I wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.Flaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10","

"The Avengers","lucyyy","30 October 2014","""The Avengers"" brings together a group of extremely talented actors and epic superheroes, to create an action packed movie with hilarious banter laced into countless scenes. Superhero movies give actors a chance to play new characters with personalities they have never portrayed before. Chris Evans is the extremely passionate and kind hearted Captain America, while Robert Downey Jr is the tougher and sassier Iron Man. The film is very creative with introducing each character and later bringing them together. The villain, Loki Laufeyson, played by Tom Hiddleston, even shows his weak spots and is almost seen as part of the Avengers team. The actors have fantastic chemistry with each other on and off screen, and they make man- tights and capes look more fashionable than ever. The majority of the film is done by special effects, made by an amazing team. They transform New York City into a place for heroes, placing Tony Stark's towering house in the middle of the city. Even at the end of the film, the unsuspecting Tony Stark is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of everyone else. This is a wonderful movie to watch if you want to be thoroughly entertained while having your feeling played with at the same time.","

"The Avengers","adlion944","22 August 2012","I'll preface... I'm not a comic book reader. I enjoy fantasy, as long as it makes sense in its own self-created universe (Star Wars and Trek, Harry Potter, Superman). But the Avengers is awful, and even worse considering how highly rated this junk is on IMDb. It has a couple moments of delight (but so did the Phantom Menace), and the effects are state of the art, bar none. But, this is the 50th movie in a row where the photorealistic effects impressed me. Now, I'm afraid I need a real movie to use that CGI to good effect.The Avengers fails for me due to the character combination. I didn't read a single comic book, but Universal released this huge budget movie knowing they will need to attract 10 new people for everyone who read the dusty old comic books. The Avengers are a dumb assembly of heroes. Captain America is an idiot character. He is from a different time, isn't good at anything modern (like why is he barking orders?), and has no powers whatsoever. Ditto for Black Widow and Hawkeye. I mean, the latter shoots friggin arrows. Cappy had a shield and punches guys within 5 feet of him. They are just plain lame. Thor is a GOD and the Hulk is invincible. They're immortal. Unstoppable. And Iron Man, with his impossible-to-believe suit which might as well be magic-based is also nearly invincible. Who needs the other 3? Why isn't Spiderman in this group? Or some of the X-Men? As for the humans, why do we have a city-sized aircraft carrier? That flies and looks amazingly like the big aircraft from Avatar? Why build a ship that flies? Okay, now the plot. I don't get it. This movie is 2:22 minutes. I don't even understand Loki's motivation or plan. Loki wants to blow up Earth? Why? Why do those Aliens/Clash of the Titans monsters want to blow up Earth? Why could Thor and Loki get to Earth but they can't without the magic portal? Are those monsters magical or technological? And that cube - seriously, they used the same lame McGuffin from Transformers. Which is a movie very much like this one. I mean that as an insult. What was Loki's plan, crumble the outer shells of buildings in NYC. Shoot a lot and not hit anyone? Not one human even seemed to get hit with all the devastation.I hated it. My wife and kids hated it. My 9 year old son hated it. That says it all. It made no sense, was utterly talky and boring for a huge chunk of it. The Dark Knight wipes its rear end with this blu-ray disc. Avoid at all costs unless you liked Transformers 3, John Carter and Clash of the Titans.","

The combination of hardcore assassins Widow and Hawkeye, reclusive Banner, arrogant Iron Man, leader Cap and the Norse brothers Thor and Loki mixes itself together into a concoction of personalities and superpowers which guarantees to impress.Marvel has set the bar high for themselves.

Samual L. Jackson this time is front and center, and really shines in the role of Nick Fury. So does everybody else, Mark Rufalo really brings his own to Bruce Banner, although I do miss Edward Norton in the role, Rufalo does quite well. And Tom Hiddleston is quite menacing as Loki, more so then he was in Thor(2011), he was the best villain, almost tops The Joker. The rest of the cast are pretty good also.

"The Avengers","OneMovieLover","2 August 2012","'The Avengers', first of all, is a good movie. While sometimes overlong, it's entertaining, and the action scenes are amazing. However, it doesn't have enough depth to be another one of those ""classic superhero films"". The reputation instead should be ""enjoyable superhero flick"". First off, if an effort is made to assemble all of MARVEL's Avengers, that effort must be made with a little more success than this. 'The Avengers' ends up feeling like more sequel than spin-off, instead of studying and developing each character. If we're supposed to care about all these superheroes...give them noticeable differences, more display of emotions, and a distinctive background. Just because they're superheroes who have some funny one-liners doesn't mean the viewers will automatically think they're the best people who ever lived. In other words, the characters have too little depth. Something that bugs me is that a few people have been saying this is better than Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, yet the latter is a perfect example of a series of films that have greatly influenced (and perhaps even transcended) the superhero genre. In 'The Dark Knight' there wasn't a single character who was ""just there for nothing"". Meanwhile, Loki is an uninteresting villain and doesn't hold a candle to Heath Ledger's disturbing, brilliant portrayal of The Joker (who, on the other hand, actually seems like a villain even when he's just not doing anything). How come 'The Avengers' all have to work to defeat Loki and his army, while Hulk can simply toss him around like a plastic spoon? That said, the long action sequence where the assembled Avengers all defeat Loki's army is quite outstanding, and many detractors of this film admit that this is also the best part. It contains amazing cinematography, like a minute-long shot that steadily observes each Avenger and sees how they're doing with the aliens. Of course, the rest of the action scenes are also top-notch, considering there's fighting for most of the movie. The sequence with Black Widow running away from The Hulk is especially memorable, and displays arguably the most likable Avenger here, along with Iron Man. The two that we care the most about.Overall, I'd say that 'The Avengers' could have been cut about 20-30 minutes short to flow more as a superhero film. I had hoped for more character development, since there were so many characters to pay attention to. I loved the action, and was pleased with the clever action scenes, especially the last 40 minutes and the parts with Black Widow. It's undeniably entertaining, and while it's not transcendent and genius, it's a great popcorn-flick. Would I see it again? Yes, but not my #1 priority.","

Hell, this was worth the wait 7 years ago when it was first developed. Do we really think this will be in development hell? This is The Avengers ""EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES!"" This is something what has NEVER been done before & Marvel has got there finger on the pulse. In 1998, a minor marvel character featuring a human/vampire hybrid made it way to the big screen. In 2000, a group of mutants evolved into the box office. In 2002, was the year of the Spider.After Daredevil, Hulk (Ang Lee), The Punisher, Elektra, Man-Thing, Fantastic Four & Ghost Rider, Marvel Studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures & the funding will come from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. The result led to the creation of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". Sounds cool, right? It was. No, really, It F***in' was. Iron Man made its motion picture debut, The Hulk got rebooted, Thor & Captain America have ""FINALLY"" got the Big screen treatment. Then came a huge shift in the Marvel universe.... Marvel Entertainment is now owned by Mickey Mouse.Amazing. Disney let go the Power Rangers franchise & bought Marvel.But after everything from comics to TV & film Marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as a company & knowing the fact that the biggest supporters (including me) are the fans. That is why they CAN NOT Disappoint us. Yeah, we complain about story lines, costumes & special effects, But if they stay true to the comics, the films would have done its justice. But i know deep down, Marvel Studios will always put out films & stay close to the material. So, what i've said earlier, was it worth the wait? Yes. Yes it was ""definitely"" worth it.Marvel Studios, the cast & crew of The Avengers did an amazing job & on the Marvel Cinematic Universe & i can't wait to see what comes next.Now if DC & Warner Bros. step their game up, we would like to see the Justice League into the big screen.","

"The Avengers","SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","10 June 2012","It's finally here. OH MY GOD. As a big comic fan it's amazing to see how far the genre has come in the last decade. We finally get star studded spin-off featuring a large cast of some of the greatest characters. If you've been living under a rock, then you may not have noticed that over the last five years, Marvel have been churning out their big hitters and building up to The Avengers. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk join forces to stop Thor's brother, Loki and his alien army. Sure, the plot is simple, but that's what we want for a big smackdown. For any team we need a great leader and Marvel have found the best in Joss Whedon. With his familiarity with large ensembles he effortlessly gives every hero their due. He also manages to flesh out characters in very short scenes. We get a sense of Stark and Potts relationship, some back story for Black Widow and Hawkeye, the confusion of Rogers and so forth. He does his best work with Hulk. I've loved every incarnation of the Hulk so far, so I was wary of Ruffalo's performance. He captures it perfectly, going for a more nervous and geeky Banner. When the Hulk is unleashed, Whedon makes sure to not take it too seriously. Hulk gets the biggest laughs in this surprisingly comic film. The action is fantastic, with a number of exciting set pieces. The final battle has so many wonderful character moments immersed in the action, and they really do work as a team. There are a couple of shortcomings. The alien race is just pathetic, and never really feels like a threat. Add to that the whole mother ship destroyed and every alien dies plot convenience. The film lacks any real threat. We hear about the many people Loki kills, but we never see anything that relates to this. Without seeing the sacrifices made it's hard to get too involved. There are also a few moments where characters just happen to show up. These are things that are minor nitpicks. After all, the only way to do a perfect Avengers movie would be to have an unlimited budget and unlimited running time. What it does achieve is simply amazing and very exciting for the future of superhero films.","

"The Avengers","moviexclusive","19 April 2012","A colossal wave of fevered anticipation has preceded the arrival of 'Marvel's The Avengers', the culmination of five incredibly successful standalone films over the last four years. Not only has helmer Joss Whedon not cracked under the immense hype, he has amazingly managed to surpass the loftiest expectations with a movie that towers over the rest that have come before it, combining jaw-dropping action, tongue-in-cheek humour and poignant drama into a dazzling piece of summer blockbuster entertainment. Proving that the whole can be so much more than the sum of its parts, Wheedon has distilled the best elements of each of the preceding movies into this assembly of Marvel superheroes- Iron Man is wiry and snarky as ever; Thor is just as Godly in his might but Human-ly in his compassion; and Captain America is still appealingly old-school. The Hulk, or Bruce Banner in his human form, is quite something else altogether though (being the only character to have a change of actor from the aforementioned films) and very much all the better for it- but we'll save our gushing for later.It shouldn't come as any surprise that the one movie which 'Avengers' is most intimately associated with is 'Thor', given that both share the same villain- Thor's adopted brother and fellow Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston)- and that Wheedon did shoot the post-credits scene with Loki and S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Opening with a recurring character from that movie, Dr Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) is now assisting with experiments on the Tessaract which has quite unexpectedly displayed a life of its own.Turns out that the fallen Loki has been drafted by an alien race to lead its invasion of Earth, using the same Tessaract as a portal to cross over from their universe to ours- and his arrival not only leads to the decimation of the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, but also the takeover of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr Selvig to do his bidding. With the fate of the world in the balance, Fury activates his 'Avengers' initiative to gather the aforementioned superheroes with two others- Black Widow and Hawkeye. Even from the outset, it's clear that there is organic spontaneity in Wheedon's storytelling, as he fluently weaves together the recruiting exercise by Fury and his trusted agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the participating superheroes. The best he saves for last, so even though Thor only first appears half an hour into the movie, his is a spectacular entrance befitting of that for a God, crossing paths with Iron Man for a thunderous one-on-one clash in the middle of the woods.True to the spirit of the books, the assembly of these superheroes begins on a fractious note- chiefly due to Stark's distrust of Fury and disdain for the star-and-stripes-outfitted Captain America. Instead, Stark teams up with the only person he deigns as his intellectual equal- Bruce Banner- to locate the Tessaract and uncover what dirty secrets Fury has been keeping from the rest of them. The answer to the latter isn't all too unexpected, but kudos to Wheedon for tying this little detail nicely with what happened in 'Thor'. It will take something colossal to jolt them out of their self- centredness- and believe us when we say that game-changer is certainly massive, counting for the first of two action setpieces in the movie that will undoubtedly qualify amongst some of the most spectacularly thrilling stuff you'll see on the big screen this year. And just when you think it couldn't get any better, Wheedon tops it with an even grander and absolutely breathtaking climax set in the heart of New York City.The reason why the finale works so brilliantly is the same as why the entire movie is that awesome- Wheedon loves and respects each and every superhero character just as much. Wheedon gets the action pitch-perfect through reinforcing the individual powers of each one of the superheroes before uniting their strengths to form an even mightier coalition. It is nothing less than pure ecstasy when they join forces as a team, and you'll find it difficult to resist getting up from your seat and cheering for them at various points throughout the remarkable finish.This review however won't be complete without a special shout-out for the Hulk, many fans of whom have been disappointed by both the Lee Ang and the later Louis Leterrier iteration of it. Here, Wheedon has finally gotten it right, blending both the character's brains and brawn to crowdpleasing effect- even more so through some clever plotting that ensures Banner's eventual transformation from man to beast is as rewarding as it should be. Indeed, there's really no reason why you shouldn't be running out and catching this the first instance it opens. Calling it the perfect summer blockbuster is probably not enough to do justice to just how brilliant it is, and well deserving of every superlative we have lavished on it thus far. Filled with wit, humour and incredible action, it ranks as one of the most- if not the most- entertaining and exhilarating experiences you'll have at the movies this year.","

"The Avengers","natcarr-74-27114","14 May 2012","Loved this movie, even at almost 3 hours long it didn't drag. Joss Wheddon (Firefly and Buffy) effortlessly out did all of the battle scenes in every Transformer movie with the climatic showdown. there are even two or three seriously laugh out loud moments, mostly concerning The Hulk, but don't worry the film takes itself fairly seriously so you can escape into the story and immerse yourself.Fans of Ironman, Thor and Captain America will not be disappointed. Every one of the superheroes gets their moment in the sun. And of course, there's Scarlett's character Black Widow. YUM! I'm giving the movie 10/10 (2D HD version) because it's so entertaining and it fulfilled all my expectations. You won't be disappointed.As far as the format goes though, stick with HD, there wasn't any real 3D moments. If you are hugely into your 3D experience, think twice before paying the extra, there wasn't any stand out 3D moments, but lots of out of focus backgrounds which kinda wasted the small fortune that must have been spent on production. Go HD you'll get a better experience.","

"The Avengers","tieman64","24 August 2013","Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" opens with the arrival of Loki (Tom Hiddleson), Norse God of Mischief, on the planet Earth. Here he encounters Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of a superhero law enforcement agency. This introductory sequence is designed to show off both Loki's ruthlessness and the manly coolness of Nick Fury, but it achieves neither. It's an over-long sequence, filled with bad CGI and second-rate action.The film then offers a series of vignettes in which Fury assembles a group of superheroes, including Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Their task? Stop Loki and his giant CGI army. The problem? All these superheroes are too busy bickering to band together, organise and efficiently kick butt.Your typical Whedon tale centres on a Scooby Doo gangs of likable heroes (""Serenity"", ""Firefly"", ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", ""The Astonishing X-Men"" etc) and ends with a hero sacrificially dying for the greater good. Whedon's heroes are also never able to prevail without a little help from their buddies, and there is always some tension between being the sole saviour and having to work with others to accomplish a goal. As he typically has only tiny budgets at his disposal, Whedon also relies heavily on clever writing, witty banter and comedic irreverence to generate excitement. With ""The Avengers"", however, he has been granted zillions of dollars and has been unconsciously domesticated by the demands of the summer blockbuster. The result is a film which is continually pulling in two directions, wanting to be huge, bloated and filled with generic spectacle on one hand, and wanting to be clever, small and intimate on the other. In the end, the vulgarity of money wins out over good prose.Still, a number of classic Whedon moments do survive. One cleverly written vignette has Black Widow tied to a chair, seemingly being interrogated by a gang of villains. We then learn that it is she who is in control of the situation and that it is SHE who is interrogating THEM. Another clever moment sees Loki imprisoned in a glass cage at the heart of our heroes' stronghold (yes, that cliché again), no one realising that Loki has designed his own capture, the God of Mischief attempting to live up to his namesake and sow discord within his enemy's own home. Most of the film's other good scenes revolve around the Hulk, who's imbued with much pathos by Mark Ruffalo, an actor renowned for his many melancholic-man roles; Ruffalo elevates everything he touches.The rest of ""The Avengers"" unfortunately degenerates into CGI fisticuffs, Michael Bay styled mayhem, exploding cities, CGI aliens, errant missiles and sequences which feel like an angry kid bashing action figures together. Here's a film which spends zillions of dollars bludgeoning us, when a guy like Whedon can cook up infinitely more excitement with a simple rope, chair or the sheer possibility that the Hulk might go schizoid. Like most Marvel projects, ""The Avengers"" mistakes excess for excitement.Whedon's never been a good visualist. Even his stint writing for the ""X-Men"" comics (""The Astonishing X-Men"", a series arc which plays almost exactly like Whedon's ""The Avengers"" movie) relied more on words, banter, and the energy of his prose than well drawn panels. In this regard, most of ""The Avengers"" is slow and generically shot, though it does contain a few great visuals. A brief shot of a SWAT squad advancing on the Hulk's tiny shack is particularly cool. Beyond this, the film offers the usual super-hero subtext. Here the enemy hopes to invade America (New York) and obtain the Tesseract, a much coveted cube which can provide endless energy and which was placed on Earth thousands of years ago by Gods. Our heroes, of course, band together to stop the theft of the Tesseract. In a previous Marvel film, ""Captain America"", a Nazi figure called Red Skull also attempted to acquire this energy source. In Marvel lore, it's always our squeaky clean, white Western ubermensch who decide who gets to keep Earth's resources. Same as the real world, though the Pentagon rarely wears spandex when it's nuking for oil grids.Incidentally, Whedon's Loki is one of the most pathetic super-villains of all time. He's a whiny dude, with all the menace of a high school chemistry teacher. You'd think The Avengers would assemble only for big fish, but no. They apparently take on wimpy Norse Gods as well.7.5/10 – See Josh Trank's ""Chronicle"".","

"The Avengers","aaronjbong","6 May 2012","After years and years of anticipation, we finally get to see some of our favorite superheroes meet and fight together as a team. Creating a movie like this is difficult, considering that it would be hard to combine the different superheroes' story lines and merge them into one storyline. However, Marvel pulled that off easily by strategically releasing movies over the past four years about each of the heroes to serve as prologues and create anticipation for this amazing, awesome, action-packed ""The Avengers"".In the first 45 minutes, we see what has happened to our favorite Marvel superheroes in their own respective lives. Iron Man is forced back into action when he was in the middle of a date with Pepper Potts. The star-spangled soldier Captain America has woken up from his 70-year-old frozen sleep and has a lot to explore in his new surroundings. The new fresh revamped Bruce Banner has been helping sick kids in India. Black Widow is taking a day off by taking another mission when a call from Agent Coulson requires her to return to normal business with Nick Fury. Thor comes a bit later on and we meet newcomer master archer Hawkeye.So what's the danger this time? It's none other than Loki from ""Thor"". To answer some of your questions, No, he didn't die (the post-credits scene from ""Thor""). So even if he didn't die, how did he arrive on Earth when the bridge connecting the different universes has been destroyed? Apparently, Loki was saved by another alien race called the Chitauri. He offers a deal with the Chitauri leader; he will command the Chitauri army in an attempt to subjugate Earth in exchange for the Tesseract. So Loki arrives through the Tesseract (which has the ability to build portals) on Earth and starts to execute his plan.While Loki was doing fine in the early stages of his schemes, the heroes didn't get along so well in the beginning. As reality would suggest, the members of the team get into some fights (there's one action-packed scene where Iron Man fights against Thor with Captain America caught in between). There's a lot of dispute between the superheroes, much to Loki's favor, all due to either rivalry, jealousy, suspiciousness, or many other reasons. This gives the heroes more humanity and possibly some vulnerability which really make the movie more realistic. This is just one of the highlights of Joss Whedon's flawless script.Joss Whedon also successfully blended the different universes of the different superheroes and made it into one film. This is rather difficult considering the natures of the superheroes. World War II to Captain America seems like yesterday and he still has a lot to catch up with (he doesn't know who Stephen Hawking is). Thor, who is of mythological nature, is still used to Asgardian lifestyle. Joss Whedon successfully pulled this off and so the interaction between the different superheroes seem sensible, not awkward. The dialog is perfect and natural.Perhaps the best thing about this movie is the action. By giving the characters the sense of vulnerability, the fight scenes seem more risky and more heart-pumping. While it may be heart-racing, the action scenes are also fun to watch, especially when we see the Incredible Hulk in action. The Hulk is just a mindless monster (although he suddenly becomes aware of himself towards the climax) who wrecks havoc at anything that he considers a potential threat. His role in destroying the enemies during the climax was very entertaining. That said, the climax and finale of the film was one of the best and one of the most thrilling I've ever seen. It offers brilliant visual effects and conjures up enough awe to satisfy anyone seeking intense sequences of action. By the end of it, you'll be satisfied but will still be eager for more.The performances were very convincing. Robert Downey Jr. played the role of the quirky Tony Stark to perfection. His dialog, his performance, everything about him was just perfect. Chris Evans also had a strong performance playing the role of Captain America. He was able to exploit the Captain's inner feelings. Chris Hemsworth also did justice with Thor, Samuel L. Jackson did a commanding job as Nick Fury, Jeremy Renner played a determined Hawkeye, Scarlett Johansson played a sexy and deadly Black Widow, Tom Hiddleston portrayed a malicious and manipulating Loki. However the main star of the show was Mark Ruffalo as the incredible Hulk. He was able to portray a calm, tranquil Bruce Banner but also showed signs that Bruce Banner can, at any time, become the Hulk.The humor is heart-warming and very well. Every now and then, there's always a little bit of humor to cheer up the audience. While one might expect that most of the humor would come from the charismatic Robert Downey Jr., actually the humor is divided equally among the characters including Loki. Why I love this is because every character has a chance to shine and steal the scene.""The Avengers"" is a must-see and a great movie to start the summer movie season. It's got the interesting premise, the operatic action scenes, the great jokes and many more to offer. This is absolutely one of the best, if not, the best superhero film of all time. It offers a great deal of fun for a broad range of viewers. Just get up from the couch, head to the nearest movie theater and watch ""The Avengers"". It's great and 3D is a viable option. Oh, and once the credits roll, don't leave yet. There's two post-credits scenes you don't want to miss, and one of them involves the Chitauri leader.Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: ""The Avengers"" is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films of all time and is guaranteed to blow audiences away with plenty of action sequences, outstanding visual effects, a powerful script, and solid performances.","

"The Avengers","danieltay47","29 June 2012","At first when I heard of this show, I was kinda excited about it. But when I went to the cinemas yesterday to watch it, I was tempted to leave my seat already at the early part of the show. It's not the characters or actors that is horrible, it's the director to be honest. I don't know how the script writers come what with this or even how the director approve it, but the lines and conversation were so fake, blunt and seriously horrible. It lakes emotions, feelings or even creativeness. Let alone, the whole plot is too predictable and boring. No doubt the action scenes is good and the graphic is awesome, but the plot and horrible lines just make this show right at the bottom of my list for shows in 2012. I rather watch ""The Dark Knight"" anytime rather than this horrible show. Even friends of mine who are crazy about DC and Marvel comics were absolutely disappointed in this show. In fact, they leave the theatres during halfway of the show. This is just an example to show how horrible it is. All in short, this show to me is not worth watching or buying and was a waste of 143 minutes of my time.","

Loki as a villain was so entertaining into me probably the best performance in this movie Iron Man, Captain America Thor, black widow hulk, and Hawkeye were all interesting, and had a character arc of reuniting as a team and they did that really good. The only problem that I have with this movie is just a joke. It was too many jokes, but they balance out the jokes with the seriousness, and made sure he didn't feel like a parity of itself. This was a really good movie, and where the MCU became a cultural phenomenon 9/10.","

"The Avengers","saad_khi","29 May 2012","Six (super heros) versus one nemesis!! Otherwise usually it's one against one. The fact is this film is over-hyped and doesn't live up to what it claims to be nor does it complement the critics' excitement, which is to rave the first action movie of the summer - like a ritual and to be quoted in the ads. While watching I asked myself how many times have I seen done to death special effects like a gaping hole in the sky? The aliens raining and attacking New York? Technical jargon supplemented by devices and gizmos? Some huge contraption passing for a space station floating in the sky? And so much executed and projected before that I felt fatigued! The 3D effects are absent where they should have been in your face and more - like when the black widow holds the gun at a character and the nozzle is out of the frame! The cohesive factor, and which keeps it going is the (tongue in cheek) wit, which everyone is blessed with! So much so such dialogues appear to be out of a MAD satire! And to think of it when Thor knew Loki so well or his psyche, then why send for the other five?","

Very good acting from all the main characters and good acting from the rest. Great Directing and writing from Joss Whedon too. The cinematography was stunning throughout the whole film.This is a fun action packed film for the whole family to enjoy just like the rest of the Marvel movies but better. The special effects by far are the best for any Marvel movie. The Hulk Looks so much more real. By the way The Hulk made the movie even better. Also, DO NOT SEE THE AVENGERS IN 3D! See the film because you will not be disappointed even if you are not that interested into superhero movies. It has a lot of humor and love, so again SEE IT!","

"The Avengers","Mahan18","12 May 2012","Yeah, much like everyone else, I friggin' LOVED this movie. This is the purest comic book movie I have ever seen, and for that reason alone it works. Everything, from the writing to the action to the humour to the chemistry between characters to even the pacing feels like it was pulled straight from the pages of the lavishly ludicrous, and having one of the gods of cult sci-fi/fantasy, not to mention a comic book writer, at the helm of this movie was probably the only way this movie could have possibly met with everyone's expectations.4-5 years of build-up to this movie, and it more than just pays off; it wins the jackpot. I am yet to find a person who didn't like this movie, and I can fully understand why. I honestly TRIED to find something about it to even nitpick at, and found nothing. This is the ultimate comic book movie; I highly recommend this to any lover of action, superhero or sci-fi movies, as well as to any avid comic book readers. For all those who don't fit into these categories, this movie may just convert you.","

"The Avengers","Jwdjrs","9 July 2012","When I saw previews and commercials for this movie, I got really excited. I was a big fan of the old 70's Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk show. I loved Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk and the 2008 Hulk, so I knew Hulk would make a big impact on everyone who saw Avengers. Tony Stark was just flat out hilarious. 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger was not the greatest Marvel movie. I still liked Cap. America, but I just thought it was too in the 40's (kind of boring). I loved the Thor movie because there was great fun action in almost every scene (like the Avengers). The Avengers tops every Marvel movie I've ever seen and I can't wait for the September 25th Blu-ray/DVD release! I LOVE THE AVENGERS!! It might be hard for The Dark Knight Rises to top this film.","

I enjoyed the first Iron Man movie way much than this! And I speak as a huge comic fan. I was looking forward to this movie, but i wasn't dying of impatience like all the fans who overrated it! 8.7? Seriously?! What made the movie was only the characters! Because you really care for them and they were more comic book accurate than ever! But that's it...

But when we talk about being disappointed because of the high expectations we had from a movie i can assure you that no matter how high your hopes may be pinned on this film you will not get be disappointed at any cost.Joss whedon has put together some of the most talented actors out there into a very sensibly written script(Funny, thrilling lacking even a single dull moment) to create what i would like to refer to as a phenomenal film which till now was considered only a rare possibility.I will say one thing though, while the film was still in development i was bit weary of Tom Middleton handling all these superheroes by himself, but to my amazement he was a total 'bad***',intense and menacing a supervillan to simplify what I'm trying to say! hats off to you mate!!!

"The Avengers","Horst_In_Translation","7 October 2017","Here we have ""The Avengers"", the five-year-old movie from 2012 that was really breaking all box office records back 5 years ago. The director and co-writer was Joss Whedon, at that point mostly known for Buffy and Toy Story, the film that brought him an Oscar nomination. But now, this one here is certainly his career-defining work. The era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and RDJ's Iron Man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a Marvel superhero all-stars film. Thor and Captain America of course have their own films now too. But back to this one here. Hiddleston was still doing a good job and Loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly. Some great potential this character has. Not a surprise at all, Whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy, drama and action sequences. Most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end. The only parts I did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the Tony Stark one-liner moments, but that's also subjective.This film was nominated for its special effects for a BAFTA and an Oscar and lost both times to Life of Pi. Of course, fitting the box office success, it received many other honors during the award season back then. At slightly over 140 minutes, it is a really long watch indeed and I think there were enough insignificant moments to stay under the 2-hour-mark. But I still take it as it is as there wasn't a great deal of dragging which is certainly a success for its duration. Back to the villain, Loki may have been the primary antagonist here, but there is a lot more conflict in here, most of all the Avengers managing to grow into a team that manages to hold their egos back a bit for the greater cause. It's a long way to that. And when it's finally done, Loki reappears by opening the gates to hell or the gates to the ""other end of the universe"" as they were saying. So what was the best thing here? Yes it may be the special effects work indeed as they helped the film nicely to overcome a few lengths. And I am not talking about the spectacular stuff like the explosions here, but also for example about the more subtle effects like what Iron Man sees written in his mask.So yeah, overall I think this was a good watch. Everybody will have their favorites from the cast, but as the film is so long, every bigger character gets his solid deal of screen time. For me, these would be Jackson, Renner and ScarJo of course, even if I must admit that SLJ's character did not do a whole lot for me in here. It's a film you want to watch when you are in for some pointless fun. It's of course not a realistic movie at all from start to finish, but it's still a success and not just in quality, but also definitely from the commercial perspective. No surprise number 3 is coming out soon. Still the IMDb and RT ratings may be a bit too high to be honest. Nonetheless, if you are not one of the million people who have seen and rated this blockbuster here on IMDb, it really is high time to finally go check it out. Today was the second (or third) time I watched it and I think it does not lose any of its appeal on rewatch. Go for it, especially if you like Marvel films. I give this first (new) Avengers film a thumbs-up. The character are really interesting and fun to watch, not just during their introduction in the first 45 minutes.","

"The Avengers","Leemsn-co-uk","28 April 2012","Cannot find too much fault in this film, apart from maybe the fact you will need to have seen all previously related films, luckily I had seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America and Thor, so I knew the back story from the get-go.I feel all of the characters were given enough screen time, I would have maybe liked to see Thor a bit more, I think he was underused, he could have done a lot more with his massive power, like killing one of those massive lizard things on his own, the character of the Hulk was brilliantly well played by Mark Ruffalo, he portrayed Banner as a very calm and collected man and very laid back which is needed for him, it created a newfound interest in the character for me, as I was never a great fan of the Hulk. As always Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job of Iron Man, with the majority of the film's funny lines coming from him.Chris Hemsworth borough back the mighty Thor and did so tremendously, like I said I think he could have been used a lot more, the Black Widow was also a nice addition, even though she had appeared previously in Iron Man 2, (although the tight leather outfit was a bit distracting lol.) I found it incredibly hard to stop looking at her behind, but luckily I was wearing 3D glasses in the dark so nobody could tell.Hawkeye was really well played, for some reason the actor looks a LOT like Gerard Butler to me, I don't know why. But regardless he is a great character and I found it very funny when he asked Iron Man for a lift up to a roof of a building, and Tony Stark replied ""Ok hang on then Legolas"". Little funny lines like that made the entire cinema laugh a lot.The humour of the film mainly came from Iron Man/Tony Stark, also quite a lot of funny moments came from Bruce Banner/The Hulk. I was a bit confused as to why he can suddenly control the Hulk, when he completely lost control on the ship earlier on. There were deep and meaningful thoughts about Bruce's alter ego, but there was a lot of humour to be had from the Hulk as well, (particularly when he smashes Loki on the ground again and again).One small annoyance I had was the continuity on the level of strength and toughness each character had. In the film Thor, he was made to look like the most powerful being ever, with one whack sending big ice men flying 50 feet in the air, but in this film he only whacks them back about ten feet, which is exactly the same distance Captain America and Iron Man can hit (which it shows in the fight scene involving the three of them). It's just an annoyance of mine but I found it hard to figure out which one of them had the most strength, fair enough Steve Rogers is a super soldier but Thor is a demigod, you would think he would have a lot more more strength in comparison, one second a whack from Thor's Hammer can knock the Hulk ten feet away, but it doesn't even leave a scratch on Captain America's shield? And yes I know the shield is made with some indestructible material mentioned in the Cap film, but the Hulk is quite tough too and he got knocked away completely.I also kinda wished they fought directly next to each other more, you never see all of them at the exact same place, they're always scattered about and you never get the feeling they are a full team, throughout the film I was waiting for some epic bit where all 5 of them pulled off some unique combo that involved all of them, but the most I got was two or three of them in the same place in the final battle.But all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely frightful, you get some empathy for Bruce Banner, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it, I was worrying it might be too many characters for one film but they nailed it.","

"The Avengers","EUyeshima","3 June 2012","Unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avant-garde short subjects in tiny projection rooms, then chances are pretty good that you'll have a rollicking good time watching this 2012 megawatt adventure epic. I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that made ""Iron Man"" (1 & 2), ""The Incredible Hulk"" (the 2008 version), ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" purely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable. A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in ""Thor"") while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in ""Iron Man 2"", to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.) For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life. It's gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory.","

"The Avengers","joachimokeefe","3 May 2012","By geeks, about geeks, for geeks. Tempting the geek dollar out of its den into the local multiplex with a thrill that can't be bought on the Xbox.Is it The West Wing in space? Or is it Stargate meets X-Men? There is not a shred of originality or true imagination in this noisy, flashy, ugly commercial behemoth. It is part of an action figure marketing campaign; a film made by men who still think like pre-teenagers, who were inspired long ago by comic books cheaply churned out by groups of at most six people - who at least had a grasp of characterization.The now-grown comic-book readers have to remain in their adolescent playrooms and pay homage to that excitement because they dare not go out into the world and feel real suspense, fear, or loss. They must burn gazillions of dollars and employ thousands of people in trying to recreate that comic-book buzz. A long-lost childish thrill is the only feeling they are willing to let themselves - or you - experience.Will you join them? Will you sit in a darkened room pretending that you are engaging with life because you have a 3D screen, surroundsound, and a broadband connection? Will it be enough for you to escape into Joss Whedon's stunted teenage netherworld, or will you go outside and attempt to engage with - god forbid - strangers, rather than aliens, superheroes and vampires?There are movies, even trashy ones, that will echo, embellish and enhance your experience of the world. 'Avengers Assemble' isn't one of them; it's shiny, expensive, overwrought trash that assumes we are all as insecure, stupid and frustrated as those who created it.You will have forgotten it long after you still remember how much it cost to get in.

"The Avengers","Chalice_Of_Evil","26 April 2012","As one of the seemingly few who's not a fan of the Iron Man character or his films, and after seeing the trailers, I had my reservations about this film. Was it going to be Iron Man 3, guest-starring the rest? Well, yes and no. It's clear who Joss Whedon's favourites are, as they get the most character development. Those who come out on top: Tony Stark (of course), Black Widow and (surprisingly) Bruce Banner/Hulk. If you're a fan of these characters/the actors who portray them, then you should be satisfied with their amount of screen time.Fans of Stark, who don't mind his attitude and want nothing more than his mumbled speedy snarky lines/blowing stuff up will be the most pleased. Annoyingly, even his love interest gets to be the only one to appear in this film (too bad for Peggy Carter & Jane Foster, both of whom I greatly prefer as characters. Though at least we get to see a *picture* of them and it's mentioned that Jane's safe. I wish Thor had been allowed to reunite with her before he left again). RDJ does his thing, and he's naturally fine doing it, but I'm probably in the minority who prefers him as Sherlock in his Sherlock Holmes films.Captain America thankfully gets to retain his likability, calls Tony out on his BS (there's more than one scene of two verbally sparring) and has his moments of leadership. I was annoyed, however, that his practical costume from CA: TFA was replaced with one that looked like the comical outfit he wore when promoting war bonds during the 'Star Spangled Man' song/dance number in his solo film. It's pretty clear Whedon views him as a 'dork' of sorts, so he's reduced to the butt of jokes and not getting to be 'cool' like Stark. Even with Whedon's clear bias against him, Steve continues to be the most likeable/noble hero.Scarlett Johansson gets to kick sufficient ar$e as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and does a good job of subverting the obvious (something Whedon is a fan of...along with scenes where everyone yells over the top of each other). There are a few moments where it appears she's beaten/showing signs of weakness, but then she turns things on their head and she proves herself to be no damsel and more than capable/not to be underestimated. The one somewhat 'regressive' role Whedon sticks her in is 'beauty taming the beast' in regards to her character and the Hulk.Speaking of the 'other guy'(as Bruce calls him), this Hulk looks better than the two previous movie versions thanks to motion-capture allowing Mark Ruffalo to actually portray the not-so-jolly green giant and even his face bears resemblance to Ruffalo. Bruce gets to be all brooding and restrained for the bulk of the movie, but when he eventually Hulks out, he does plenty smash-o-crash. Unfortunately, Hulk is also played for some rather immature laughs at times, like when he punches Thor after they've just teamed up to take down a baddie (why? Because it's ""FUNNY""!) or he cuts Loki off mid-speechifying by tossing him around like a ragdoll, thus kinda undoing all the effort Tom Hiddleston put into making Loki menacing (there's one exchange he has with Natasha where he comes across truly evil). It's clear Whedon's not a fan of 'god-like' characters and hopes to sway others to be like-minded.Nick Fury gets to be sneaky/manipulative, jumps on the 'Let's blame Thor' train and shoots stuff, as does his offside, Agent Hill (Cobie Smulders), when she's not providing exposition or miraculously escaping death. Hawkeye fans might be a tad miffed that he spends the majority of the film zombiefied by Loki, but is eventually freed of the mind-control and his backstory with Natasha is briefly touched upon. Even Agent Coulson gets a fair amount of development. Disappointingly, Thor gets the short end of the stick...or hammer. I'd thoroughly enjoyed his solo movie and Chris Hemsworth in the role, so I was hoping he'd get the respect/focus he deserved as part of this ensemble cast...but it seemed Tony Stark's one-liners and the Hulk beating Asgardian ar$e for laughs was Whedon's priority, sadly.Poor Thor never seems to be allowed to have a true victory in the film, which is a real disappointment since his character had undergone a true hero's journey in his own film and deserved to be taken seriously, rather than disrespected/treated as the butt of jokes. Sure, he and 'Mew Mew' get to kick a fair amount of butt, but not nearly enough as they *should've*. He doesn't even get to be the one who takes down Loki (his brother...who's adopted) in the end and save everyone, as that victory's given Iron Man and Hulk, of course (and Thor had been about to save Stark's ar$e at the end too until Hulk swooped in and stole his thunder). Such a shame that Thor gets screwed over, but I appreciated his little moments of humour (all the more effective because they *aren't* OTT or at the expense of others) and that he brought some actual seriousness to proceedings/his complicated sibling relationship with Loki wasn't entirely ignored.Despite my few quibbles, the film surprisingly comes together pretty well. Whedon proves he can direct action with the best of them and it's blissfully free of overuse of shaky-cam. It's quite the feat, bringing all these characters from different films together and actually making it *work*, but he pulls it off. Not a dollar of the movie's considerable budget has been wasted. It's all up there on the screen, the humour works (some of the time), all the actors do well in their roles, but I personally would've liked to have spent more time with Cap & Thor and exploring their reluctant partnership (how about a buddy film?). I'm more invested in their own solo films than seeing them sharing time with characters who I'm not a fan of, but not opposed to seeing the Avengers reassemble.","

"The Avengers","manendra-lodhi","14 May 2012","When I first read about the film I thought it would not be that good to watch a juice of so many characters. But the director was rightfully applauded for his work in giving a good deal of time to all the characters. Everything about the movie is very nice. It takes you through all the characters about whom you would have probably learned a lot and for those who do not know a lot, Marvel has already done everything for them to understand with a series of films based on the individual character. That is a thing that truly marks American films different from others. They know what audience will want and how to serve them. You will find a lot of instances (as I had experienced) when you would just be scared that such a nice film has to come to an end after 2 hours 20 minutes.PROS : I loved the timings of each and every characters except for hulk who was introduced in a simple manner but who ultimately steals the show based on his (my favorite) two dialogs which I have heard from everyone that they liked. The instance when hulk comes into action , everyone have to shout like hell. Iam a big fan of iron man and especially because of Robert Downey but this green character fills up the whole space every time he becomes angry or rather say wants to be angry. What I first thought before entering into this mind blowing film , I had been thinking that Thor would be playing a greater role and since he is some god typo so he will help the avengers the most. But I like to get wrong evreytime I start a film. Than comes our nick fury who though was the leader of the group in papers but appeared to be playing a role of the grand daddy. I felt this especially in the 2nd half. But that was nicely handled as he was doing whatever he could do , and what was best for him. Black Widow and I mean everyone was playing a role that they could play according to their abilities. However a single disappointment was the role of captain America who did not seem to fit properly into the fight sequences. And he was looking a kind of supporting role along side the hawk eye and the black widow.CONS – I would have liked to see some more development into the story of the tysserect and how loki got involved with everything. Everyone seemed to be in a little bit of hurry in the second half. Well may be I am too attached to the film that's why I am saying that. ""A must watch for anyone.""","

"The Avengers","lasttimeisaw","2 June 2012","Harboring a great deal of expectation of this record-breaking multi-superhero-in-a-row action mash-up, I finally caught up the last chance to watch it on the big screen, but unfortunately the film has indomitably become my very first disappointment in 2012. Alerted by the general opinion of ""if you can survive the boring first 60 minutes, the latter part will blow you away"", maybe ""boring"" is a lesser word, the inter-conversations among these superheroes are way too tedious to arouse any interest, and in light of my last encounter with THOR (2011), I know he is a boredom, then here comes his worsen twin, Captain America, so it is dumb and dumber situation. Most of characters are reprising their usual roles, Robert Downey Jr.'s sleekness is being harnessed into its maximum quota. So I assume the only revelation could come from Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, the newcomer on screen, and the third candidate of Hulk, Mark Ruffalo, but the truth is they might be a clear torrent, but cannot save this juggernaut from being a destroy-it-all dross. The fighting scenes are the saving grace here which is not a false claim, but it satisfies my eyes without compensates my soul, director Joss Whedon just haphazardly levels everything in Manhattan without any single casualty provided to imply its minimum credibility. No worries at all, we simply witnessed an empty and meaningless catastrophe without any mind activity as we all know Iron Man will not be the sacrifice as a sequel is already set on a release date. Thus, am I over-demanding here? After the invasion of myriads of this sort of big-budget action flicks, THE AVENGERS is no way a standout by any means, none of its actors could stick out with any arresting existence (I might be too desperate to count out Gwyneth Paltrow), Mark Ruffalo is the closest choice of a decent acting in it, all the rest is just the way he or she is, an utterly featherweight character study is the case here. The gags are scarce (ooh, poor Loki), too much SCI-FI doctrines and the narrative in dead earnest (thanks to you, Mr. Samuel L. Jackson) makes the film's lengthy screen time too overt to be slighted, and I waited until the end-credit rolled over, but a second bonus scenes never show off. The film's huge success has baffled me so much and its staggering status of the third biggest grossing film of all time (after AVATAR 2009 and TITANIC 1997) does make me do some solemn post-mortem to question my taste, the conclusion could be that I may be detached from the majority's liking, which thankfully I believe heralds a good sign for me, right?","

"The Avengers","ypjoshi","30 April 2012","Action movies will now have a new leader as Avengers assemble by Marvel raises the bar to an entirely new level.The hype made by Marvel in 2011, by Introducing Thor and Captain America to the audience in quick succession just as a precursor for the Avengers ,is lived up and surpassed with what will be one of the beacons in modern era action movies.The boasted budget of $220m,is well spent for the movie expectedly satisfies you as a visual treat with what i think,one of the best CG effects.Also,this one does deserve a heads up to be watched in 3D, unlike annoyingly many in the recent past.Though,the first half has a few more than necessary scenes shot in the dark,but it gets better as the movie progresses.Though the plot is pretty straight-forward,there are so many characters in the movie to keep you entertained in their very own signature fashion.Each and every character is given nearly equal importance and nobody is left out,which is an effort to appreciate. They have really put a lot of efforts in the new Hulk to bring him up to join the party with others,and Boy! it does pay off exceptionally well.Iron Man's powers are tested to a very new level and being the most skilled avenger,they had to be.He has got some new moves, watch out for them!.I am really starting to like Captain America and the way he handles the situation. The time transitioned character of his, adjusts surprisingly quickly to the new scenario.Black Widow and Hawk-Eye who had brushing references in previous movies are full fledged avengers now, but i wish marvel to bring them up in singles.There are a few much needed subtle humorous moments exercising your jaws sideways in between a lot of fantastically choreographed action scenes keeping them dropped down for most of the time.Bout the cast, Downey Jr. undoubtedly stands out as an actor, with his amazing comic timing and the way he carries the arrogance of Iron-Man. The search for Bruce Banner has ended up giving the most subtle hulk yet,with Mark Ruffalo.The Rest of the cast looks just supportive. Cobie Smulders was supposed to be the eye candy,but Scarlett Johansson steals the show in that aspect, not to mention in her alter-ego superhero moves too.All in all, an awesome summer blockbuster with wholesome entertainment. The Avengers is surely one of the best action movies to watch before you leave this dimension.","

"The Avengers","paulclaassen","7 June 2019","The movie was such a huge box office success that I tried really hard to like it. I just couldn't. Just to be certain, I gave it a second viewing, and disliked it just as much the second time around.Firstly, if you haven't seen Thor, Iron Man, Captain America or The Incredible Hulk, you'll have no idea who the characters are and what they're all about. There haven't been films about Black Widow or Hawkeye, so they don't really matter anyway. The film played like a medley of all of these super hero movies and didn't really offer anything we haven't seen in these movies. Also, due to way too many protagonists for one film, none of them were given the opportunity to develop. In fact, I found all the characters incredibly shallow, and didn't like any of them. My favorite character in the film is probably Hulk.Everything about this film was so overblown and overdone to the level where nothing was believable - within the context of the genre, off course. 'The Avengers' was so CGI heavy that it was difficult to have fun with it. The film also had so many plot flaws and credibility issues. Everything was simply done for effect at the disposal of an interesting plot. Iron Man is just as annoying as in his own franchise (although he is the deepest character of all). So, a mere mortal in a suit Tony Stark (Iron Man) can actually outwit a god like Thor??? Wow, not much hope for gods... The same goes for the powerful god Loki, who is outwitted and outsmarted so easily.The action in 'Dragon Wars' and 'Transformers' was a lot more realistic and more enjoyable than this. I've seen it twice and that's more than enough, thanks.","

"The Avengers","ThunderKing6","15 August 2019","First I rated this movie a 10 back in 2017 as during that time I was still brainwashed under the MCU. I thought they were prefect movies. I'll keep Avengers 1 as 10/10 instead of giving it a 6/10.
It's great for being a movie on this scale it's just not near the best movies or superhero movies in terms of story and development.Back in 2012 I was MCU hyped and practically worshiped the MCU and praised movies like Avengers 1. At the time in 2012 Avengers 1 I felt was the greatest thing ever.Now in 2019 my views on Avengers 1 and the MCU has changed completely. MCU does not deserve the hype it gets from the general audience and media.
Avengers 1 even for a first take was pretty generic where it still has unanswered plot holes.Avengers 1 is a good movie on its own comparison. Its overrated generally speaking. It has brainwashed fans/kids/fanboys (like I was). I was ignorant to the flaws and worshipped an ugly looking movie like Avengers 1. I once worshipped the MCU like a damn fool.MCU and the Avengers 1 ruins its self with lack of character/story development, under used villains, weak heroes and pointless jokes.Other than Loki, hela and Thanos all villains are jobbers. All the heroes are treated as highly durable in terms of plot device and plot armour.Recommendation: Watch this movie for fun while drinking a beer or some food with a lot of sugar otherwise you may get brainwashed like I was. In addition, if your will power is weak don't watch this movie or any MCU movie.","

"The Avengers","harry_tk_yung","6 May 2012","Like Bilbo's one-hundred-eleventh birthday party, ""The Avengers"" is a ""long-awaited"" event, after four (not counting Hulk) major features on the ensemble of heroes which grossed a mind-boggling aggregate box office in excess of 2 billion dollars (well over half of which coming from the two editions of Iron Man). The main plot is rather simple, and familiar: (a) Earth is fighting for its very survival against alien invasions and (b) there is an object/device of immense power sought by one and all, good guys as well as bad guys. Assembling the ensemble of six is quite a challenge. Before we examine how cleverly this is done, let's try to catalogue the protagonists. How about into 3 groups? Least ""human"" are Thor and Hulk. Early in the movie, just before his first appearance, a cryptic remark is made about Thor to the effect of something like he is ""basically a god"". Hulk remains human, but only until ""the other guy"" (a term used repeatedly by our hero himself) takes over. Next come the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" category: human with so much done to their body that they become sort of superhuman: Iron Man and Captain America. Finally, there are Black Widow and Hawkeye (altered ego of ""Green Arrow"" of the other camp, the JLA?), Nick Fury's special agents who are one hundred percent human but trained to so excel in combat that they are almost superhuman. The villains are quite unimpressive, serving as punch bags for our heroes, who provide vastly better entertainment by fighting among themselves. Let's see how cleverly this achieved by a plot that is nowhere near being convoluted and yet delightfully un-formulaic.While everything evolves around Nick Fury whose brainchild ""The Avengers"" is, assembling of the team is mesmerizing, providing plenty of opportunities for fights among the heroes. Almost from the first minute, Hawkeye defects to villain Loki who wields a brain-control device. Black Widow succeeds in persuading Hulk to join, but only as a research scientist, not a superhero (they consider ""the other guy"" more a monster than a hero). Captain America, technically over 100 years old, is revived from his deep freeze while Iron Man is led into Fury's scheme much earlier on (off screen), almost like his partner. Soon after Iron Man, with Captain America's assistance, subdues Loki (part of the villain's cunning plot) Thor who seems to have materialized out of nowhere claims his brother for a prisoner, setting off an exciting bout with Iron Man, eventually stopped by Captain America's mediation. At Fury's headquarter (an invisible flying aircraft carries – this you will have to see for yourself), five of the six Avengers assemble, with Loki in captivity. The villain's plot is to have the defected sixth (Hawkeye) come to his rescue and destroy his captors. He tries, very close to succeeding, to manipulate the team member's different personalities to set them against each other. Even more damaging, Loki thinks, is a provocation to bring out ""the other guy"", unleashing Hulk's destructive power. It seems to work initially. The attack led by defected Hawkeye provokes the appearance of green monster Hulk. The ensuing combat between the physically two most powerful (Hulk and Thor) is something to behold. While this one is sheer brutal force, the fight between the two special agents is a show of beautiful yet lethal combat techniques. The result: Hawkeye breaks out of the brain control to which he has been subjected and comes back to his senses. As well, Captain American and Iron Man, whose personality conflict has been the biggest obstacle to their cooperation, finally work together as a team.So in the last hour of the movie, while Loki brings out his alien army down on to Manhattan, The Avengers are finally cemented as a team, as you see in the most publicized trailer shot with the camera circling them in an undaunted spirit of solidarity, ready to face whatever enemy that dares to come to Earth. This movie must be seen at least twice. The first time you are dividing your attention between following the story and watching the action. Only in the second time can you fully enjoy the excellent dialogue (rare for an action movie) which will be several times more meaningful than this first. At the same time, you are able to sit back and fully enjoy the action. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth reprise their respective characters, adding a delightful new dimension on personality conflicts. All this is done mostly through crispy, witty dialogue. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, who has made brief and briefer appearances respectively in Iron Man and Thor franchises, bring more complete realization to their respective character, as well as a half-told story of their past relationship which strongly suggests a spin-off prequel. Last but certainly not least is Mark Ruffalo whose soft-spoken, low-key interpretation of Hulk gets two thumbs up from me.And of course there are all the others. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson and Tom Hiddleston's Loki need no introduction, and not even reminders. From Iron Man comes Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and from Thor comes Stellan Skarsgard's Erik Selvig, two more familiar faces. For a welcomed new face is Cobie Smulder's Agent Maria Hill.","

"The Avengers","Smells_Like_Cheese","6 May 2012","What happens when you get a team of super hero's together who shouldn't be in a room together let alone trying to save a city? You have the Avengers, one of the most anticipated movies for years. I remember working at a movie theater back in 2007 and one of the guys that worked there was telling me about how there was talks to make the film and I thought it was never going to happen, well, clearly this is why I'm not in the stock market. But when I heard that Joss Whedon was behind it, I couldn't wait, he's the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and is one of Hollywood's best writers. He has a genuine love for comics, action and giving characters real depth. After viewing The Avengers, you couldn't ask for better action on the big screen and so much great excitement. I think the fans got everything they were asking for and deserved with this great popcorn flick.Nick Fury arrives at a remote research facility during an evacuation. The commander explains that an energy source of unknown potential has activated and opened a mysterious portal. Through it steps the exiled Loki, who takes the Tesseract and uses his abilities to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel including agent Clint Barton and a few others in order to aid in his getaway. In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the Avengers Initiative: Agent Natasha Romanoff, Dr. Bruce Banner, Agent Phil Coulson, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract from Loki. However, Thor, Loki's adoptive brother, arrives and attempts to free Loki to reason with him. When that doesn't work, the hero's start fighting over who's in charge until they realize that Loki's ego is growing stronger and will destroy the world if they do not stick together and stop him as The Avengers.First off, the actors: Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson all clicked so amazingly well together. I'm still a little bummed that they couldn't get Edward Norton for the Hulk, he was a perfect cast and just excellent in The Incredible Hulk, but Mark gives his own take to the character and comes through in the end. The effects are so amazing and grand to watch on the big screen that this was the only way you should see the movie as they are just tearing New York apart with all these aliens and flying creatures in the middle of down town Manhatten. Now one of the things I do have to laugh a little at is that all the characters get these cool costumes, sleek, sexy and toughthen you have Captain America who looks like he got his costume at Target. You can't blame the officer he tells to get the police to get the civilians to safety and the officer asks ""and who are you that I should be taking these orders from?"". There are some great comedic moments, especially with Robert Downey, Jr. and The Hulk just going crazy on Loki.There are a couple of flaws in the film like Loki. I don't know if it was the actor, Tom Hiddleston, but I just couldn't really take him seriously as a villain. I found the aliens who were invading more threatening as Loki just keeps saying ""Kneel before me! I am a God!"" and giving you a used car salesman's smile. There are moments where it seems to drag a little with the talking, as we're getting our hero's together. I'm all for development, but I wanted a WWE smack down because we're not given as much depth with these characters as you would say Spider-man or Batman. But I think I'm just nitpicking at this point because I don't want to put anyone off on the film.The Avengers is everything you could ask for in a superhero film. It's got great action, excellent chemistry, good style and is just a ton of fun to watch. I got to see this in a crowded theater where you can tell the audience was just pumped up to see something good and you got to give the film credit for bringing some excitement to the theater. We don't get many exciting films that have actual good writing to it like this. Joss did an excellent job handling these big guys on the screen and I'm looking forward to the sequel. Though I hope there is more egging on of the Hulk, I would have a ton of fun if I were next to him saying what Captain America was talking about his mama.8/10","

"The Avengers","rosvel92","3 January 2016","I would describe director's Joss Wheddon effect as making live-action persons, behave, act and look more cartoonish than cartoons themselves. In the previous films at least they behave like humans.Really, wish Jhon Favreau had been given the creative freedom he requested. This movie makes X-men: The Last Stand look good.The cast is good, but the dialogue is terrible, interactions between characters are bad, people don't talk like real people, somehow all feel out of character, they talk like people throwing jokes to an audience which is painfully awkward to watch. Dangerously close to self parody territory, I refuse to believe parts of the movie happened.Fails on having a plot of it's own. Also fails as a sequel to the previous movies, and If you were doing, a marathon I would tell you to skip this as somehow despite featuring so many characters the plot is irrelevant to all of them.Half characters are portrayals is inconsistent to the previous movies: -Hulk has new actor and personality, the character is so rebooted it doesn't even feels like it happens in the same Cannon as the Hulk movie. -Loki goes from trying to become King by deceiving Thor out of Asgard, to making a genocidal killing spree on Earth (How does killing people on Earth helps him to become King Asgard? ANswer: It doesn't), Thor is told his brother kills people he says his bro is adopted (That's just awful dialogue, if Thor takes it as a joke, how am I supposed to take the movie seriously? There's no emotional conflict). -Captain America it's just there, but never does anything. -Ironman starts as a douche and by the end isn't, for the third time, the same transformation he experienced on Ironman 1, and also on Ironman 2. - The arrow guy is brainwashed, so he never really gets to talk, and the girl is a generic though token girl, that never gets developed. I would forgive the inconsistency if the movie were better than the previous incarnations, but it is worse.Somehow the army on the climax, looks CGI paper weight, they don't even put up a fight, makes it seem like even a normal civilian could hit and destroy them, with such a weak evil army why even bother in the first place. There's no twist, no stakes, never anything feels at risk. The heroes have the upper hand through the whole movie, they win without never ever making any effort. The action is disappointing, because it's just stupid hits, no stunts, no creative fight set pieces.The Dark Knight Rises deserved the Oscar Nomination, given to this film, Ironman Armor, and Hulk look good, but the CGI Army looks fake generic awful.If you watch it might entertain you, but movie is awful, if this becomes the future of Superhero movies, then the genre might die soon. Or even worse, continue like this for decades.Feel free to disagree but I think, Avengers it's so overrated.","

"The Avengers","Staffenburgen","22 July 2012","Immediately after watching The Avengers, I was confused. All of my friends seemed to love it, the theater roared its approval as the credits rolled, and most of the reviews I've read are overwhelmingly positive. For these reasons, I'm not entirely sure I watched the same movie as everybody else, but I'm perfectly willing to comment on what I saw. The film opens with Loki stealing the Tesseract, an all powerful energy device that poses a significant threat to Earth's security. Thankfully, Nick Fury assembles the ""Avengers"", the group of superheroes who are the focus of the film. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, and Mark Ruffalo all reprise their roles of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Incredible Hulk, while Scarlet Johansson and Jeremy Renner portray the Black Widow and Hawkeye. Every single one of these characters (Loki included) is entirely one-dimensional and frankly, boring to watch. With the possible exception of the Hulk, they are straight-forward, flawless superheroes, who have absolutely no trouble dispatching anyone who crosses them. This makes the prolonged action sequences particularly difficult to watch; you never doubt who is going to prevail. As for the central story of the film, it is a complete mess. It's an action movie in the truest sense of the word; every aspect of the plot is twisted to encourage more fighting sequences, which really prevents the film from moving forward at all. The story doesn't provoke further thought in any way, and really just serves to provide mindless action and downright terrible dialogue. In particular, Downey Jr. relentlessly delivers sarcastic insults every few minutes, which just aren't that funny (in my opinion). Once or twice, I found it amusing, but by the end of the movie I was sick of it. The other characters aren't much better, with the exception of Thor, who had a few funny moments. Despite everything I have said, there's no criticizing how the film looks. The CGI sequences are stunning, and the various locations in the film are visually pleasing. It doesn't break any new ground, but it's still entertaining. Overall, this is not a good movie. The characters are flat, static, uninteresting people portrayed by uninspired actors. The story is atrocious and riddled with holes. The action sequences are painfully long and predictable. And perhaps worst of all, when it was trying so hard to be funny, it simply wasn't. Looking at all the names that contributed to this movie, I am frankly shocked at the finished product. Joss Whedon is a brilliant director and writer (I loved Firefly), and most of the actors (particularly Downey Jr., Renner, and Ruffalo) are usually enjoyable. So I'm not quite sure where everything went wrong, but hopefully they can produce a more thoughtful sequel with their next efforts. RATING: 4/10","

Spider man was my favorite superhero and i thought he was awesome and couldn't be beat. But then Iron Man showed up 6 years later and at the end i found out it was just a thread for an Avengers film. Then with some other films in order we the fans have finally gotten what we deserve and that is the crown jewel called THE AVENGERS. This film defiantly deserves the award for most anticipated summer film, best superhero film and so on. If there is one flaw i had to give this film its that this film has an ending to it. Me I could watch Iron Man Thor Hulk etc fight evil a million times over and it would never get old because Stan the man Lee has created something special with each character in Marvel and those qualities have finally come out in this film","

As I expected it was one of the best films with descent, comedy parts. The acting was above average and the dialogues were really mind-boggling. It was a bit lengthy but was touching every single minute. The story was very good and the superhero's were described nicely. Bruce Banner very polite when he was not Hulk, Captain America very serious and all that. It was defiantly worth watching and is one of the best superhero films. I am looking ford for the Avengers 2 and I am searching the whole internet for a little glimpse of it.","

"The Avengers","dhaufrect-1","25 May 2012","An example of inspiring cinema directed for young and old alike, ""The Avengers"" is does it all in this recent block buster. I agree with Rabbi Scott of Houston's Congregation Emanu El, when he described the pleasure he derived from the mesmerized youngsters in the audience as much as his own enjoyment of this super hero film. Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man once again, and he gives another uniformly perfect performance. Chris Evans is Captain America, and he too is outstanding as this superman-like individual fighting for truth and justice and the ""American Way"". Mark Ruffalo plays Dr. Bruce Banner/ The Hulk and he too is well cast and successful with his part. Thor is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, and he too is exemplary with his performance. Of course, there is Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the leader of this brave crew. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, is very convincing and an extremely tough ingénue in a film which is not directed by Woody Allen. Joss Whedon has written and directed this smash hit in 3D, and I advise that it be seen with this medium, since the special effects are enhanced to the point of overwhelming reality. Don't miss this remarkable Marvel comic piece. It is worth the effort for you and all the youngsters in the audience who will be glued to the screen.","

"The Avengers","ThomasMagnumPI","22 April 2012","Everything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the new king of the genre. The Avengers is certainly the best overall comic adaptation film ever made. Really, how could it not be? They positioned this thing with FIVE other set up films that were each remarkable in their own right. Not only does it all come together but I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, every single character featured previously in those five films gets time to really shine at one point or another in this astounding movie. Even though the set up has been epic, the result was anything but assured. It would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the task of putting all these great character together and making it click but they pulled it off perfectly. Maybe it's because the characters themselves are complex and intriguing and that they have been brought to three dimensional life by people that really care. Whatever the case, EVERYONE hits a home run here. They fleshed out perfect cohesion while remembering to include the fun and humor that have made those other five films good. If you define those films as good then you'll define Avengers as great. It's a unified step up and I didn't think that possible. What's also amazing is that I think this movie works without having seen any of those other films. Then, the fun factor will be enjoyed by those that didn't care about the other movies. The depth and amazement will come from those that have invested in to this universe. What they've done is transcend any other of this genre's films by going deeper and doing so in spectacular fashion with Oscar caliber performances. Again, easily the new king of the genre.","

"The Avengers","rayrodgpa","12 May 2012","I'll admit it, I was extremely doubtful about this film. I've loved Joss Whedon's work my entire life and I had enjoyed all the previous Marvel films that led up to this one, especially Iron Man. But the fact that they brought together all of these different characters from all these different movies and put them together in 2 1/2 hour film was unprecedented and almost seemed impossible. But the optimist in me got me to the theater with me expectations shaky. Once the film started I was quickly drawn in and once the title appeared on the screen I knew that Joss Whedon had done it. The Avengers is without a doubt my favorite Marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made. Whedon did a great job writing this masterful, witty script that ingeniously put together all these characters and made it flow perfectly. The actors did such a great job playing these characters again and it didn't seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got a chance to be in the spotlight(especially the hulk). Once you see all of the characters assemble and fight the bad guys you can't help but fill with happiness. The entire movie was such a fun thrill ride from the beginning to the end and the ending battle scene was brilliantly done. I am extremely delighted to say that Joss Whedon has done the impossible and made one of the most entertaining movies ever made.","

"The Avengers","horseygurlz","24 December 2012","The danger with every superhero movie is that it will end up either horrifically unrealistic or unappealing to anyone over the age of ten. I am pleased to say that 'The Avengers' does not fall into either of these pitholes - in fact, it has to be awarded the title of one of the best films of 2012.The actors were all amazingly casted in their respective roles and do an amazing job of creating intriguing and lovable characters. Many of them were reprising roles they had taken on in previous films - Captain America, Thor or Iron Man, for example - so we already had a good idea of how they would perform, but I feel they all exceeded expectations. Robert Downey Jr was incredible as the humorous yet conflicted Tony Stark/ Iron Man, and Chris Evans was brilliant as the confused, out-of-time Steve Rogers/ Captain America. Mark Ruffalo, the newbie of the cast, stepped into the role of Bruce Banner/ Hulk with great skill and dispersed all doubts as to his suitability. On the other side, Tom Hiddleston really has to be congratulated for his convincing and somehow relatable performance as the villain Loki, whose wit and tricks appealed to fans everywhere.The special effects in this movie were undoubtedly excellent, and despite their need to be ostentatious never seemed unnecessarily unrealistic. The director Joss Whedon did a fabulous job and has created a cinematic classic that will be praised for years to come.","

I can't find any flaws in this movie , it kinda has everything you need in a good movie:action, comedy, cool quotes and stunning special effects. I also love how marvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed. The casting choices were also great. Everyone fits perfectly as the character they were chosen to play.

This is the best superhero movie I have ever seen.It is about superheroes and it is made with today's technology. Today's technology allows movie makers to design scenes that were technologically impossible before. Any other previous superhero movie I have seen was worse.If you never got into superhero comics then this is not a movie for you.Now back to the summary line. Some (sorry) idiotic reviewers are comparing this movie to: Memento, Blade Runner, Psycho, The Empire Strikes Back, The Matrix, etc. And talking about lack of symbolism, depth, twists, etc. ""This movie doesn't deserve this high rating, etc."" Are you people on drugs?Possible explanations for these 1 star ""punisher"" reviews are: 1 some people just love to hate or 2 they had a bad day or 3 they want to show off their ""expert"" knowledge of ""le cinema"" or 4 they were simply on drugs while watching this movieSo bad news guys: This movie does not have the hyper-realism of ""The Bicycle Thief"", the supreme intrigue of ""Citizen Kane"", the old fashion romance of ""Casablanca"", or the sublime dialogs of ""12 Angry Men"". This is only the best superhero movie I have ever seen.I am 50, I have an engineering degree, my favorite pastime is movies, my favorite genre is Sci-Fi, my favorite movie is Blade Runner and THIS IS STILL THE BEST SUPERHERO COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN (sorry for shouting) and this is why in my review this movie deserves a 9 (not 10 because it is not art).If you want to see an ""artsy"" movie check out ""The Bicycle Thief"" (and take some antidepressants with you). If you want to see what a ""real"" superhero would do see ""Chronicle"" (highly recommended).If you want to see a good comic book adaptation you cannot do any better than this movie","

"The Avengers","Filmdokter","19 June 2021","#MCUrewatch. Back in 2012 this was a big thing: after their individual films Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America (together with two top assassins) team up to battle Loki and an entire army of aliens. Now we know this was just the beginning of the MCU. It is still one of the stronger films of the franchise out there. The chemistry between those characters/actors works magic. And it is the fun in seeing them both verbally and physically fighting with each other that is the Ace of the MCU and it pretty much started here. It still misses the gravitas some of the later films have (the Coulson drama doesn't really hit off that well). The action is solid and still fresh (back in '12 it was still unique when an entire city was destroyed through superhero fighting). Oh it also features the best turn of Hiddlestone as Loki. All in all still one of the best entrances in the MCU.","

"The Avengers","3xHCCH","27 April 2012","The anticipation for this film has been building up so many months since the showing of the solo movies about each of the heroes that comprise this superstar group -- Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and finally, Captain America. These individual films were all very good on their own, so very expectations are foisted on this special film that would unite all of them in one big adventure. Even though I am out of town now, that did not stop me from catching this film with some Marvel comics geeks. And for once, a film has come that fulfills it's advanced hype, and then some!The film follows how these heroes were called together and assembled by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve a blue high-energy cube called the Tesseract stolen by the Asgard god Loki. It was fun how the film depicted the clash of their individual big egos of the heroes, and they did not really get along with each other right away, as would be expected. There is humor along with the high-intensity action. I felt though that some ""funny"" scenes involving Tony Stark were too self- indulgent for comfort in a ""team"" film like this.It was great to see all of these heroes get their fair share of screen time, even the lesser known ones, like the super-archer Hawkeye (the very busy Jeremy Renner) and the amazing fighter Black Widow (stunningly portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). The others played their characters as they did in their solo movies, and amazingly, they all worked so well together here: the imperious Thor by Chris Hemsworth, the patriotic Captain America by Chris Evans and the haughty Tony Stark / Iron Man by Robert Downey Jr. People doubted if Marc Ruffalo could take Ed Norton's place as Dr. Bruce Banner and the Hulk, but Ruffalo actually imbued this character with a unique charm previously unseen in other incarnations. The Hulk received the loudest cheers from the crowd! Even the ever-loyal Agent Coulsen (Clark Gregg) gets his moment to shine.This film is a definite must-see not only for all fans of Marvel comics, but for fans of action/fantasy films in general. This is real triumph for director Josh Whedon.  Don't miss the extra scene included in the middle of the final credits for it will surely get you excited.","

They have real content. They're innovative, original, intelligent and thought-provoking. They're timeless classics.But the comparison may not be too fair, being such different genres. How does it REALLY stand up to Batman Begins (8.3), Watchmen (7.6), or any of the X-Men series, none of which reached and 8? These are all meant to fascinate and woe the same kind of target: comic-book fans, adrenaline-pumped teenagers and action-yearning males. Yet they are aeons away in terms of originality, depth, story and execution from 2012's The Avengers.I don't really have much of a gripe with ""The Avengers"" itself, as after seeing Captain America, I expected nothing more than another formulaic blockbuster. Even so, it's pretty bad even for a fill-in-the-villain/superhero/threat formula movie. A ridiculous super villain, flat characters, no excitement (as you know how things are going to turn out)My disappointment is mostly with IMDb. I'd trusted their rating in the past, but it seems as if that reliability is no longer. Either all the reviews are now being written by 10-year-olds, IMDb users are losing brain cells at an incredible pace, or something's pretty fishy.How many reviews that are titled things like ""Awesome! Blew my mind!"", or ""Coolest superhero movie ever!"", that you'd expect to be full of teenage adulation, grammatical mistakes and tons of slang, are actually very articulately written, displaying profound knowledge of script, direction, acting, and character analysis? I thought our education system was going down the drain! Where are all these lucid, eloquent, youths hiding out? And, being so instructed and discerning as they are, why the hell are they giving such a poorly made, mediocre movie such high scores?It looks like the industry's eye has finally set on IMDb's viewer-decanting power, and is corrupting it's authenticity beyond recognition. From now on, I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for real, trustworthy reviews.","

These characters will never exist, and it sure takes suspension of disbelief to watch them run about. But this movie reminded me of what they made me feel before girls, party nights, college,taxes and other complicated, serious things came along. As the movie ended, I felt overwhelmed by the readjustment to reality as I knew it in my young adult life.I watched this with my 10 year old nephew. I don't know if that makes me the crazy uncle, but it sure was great to be back in that attic, even for a while. I always knew Hulk smashed. Now I know he always will.","

There are also some who are so enamored and in love with The Dark Knight that they will pounce on any film that is considered ""better"". For me, I've never been a big comic book guy but I do enjoy a good film adaptation of them. I can love The Dark Knight AND Iron Man. I don't have a bias. I enjoy several of these type of films regardless of the company, brand, or filmmaker. For me, I absolutely love The Avengers. It brought out the little kid in me. At 33, cynical and disgruntled, that's a major compliment. I understand that the film is by no means perfect but it was just so much damn fun. It made me want to buy a costume and play make believe in the backyard again. But again, I'm 33, so I mean that figuratively. I just really had a blast with this and this is the best theater experience I've had since seeing a Star Wars movie. I loved it and can't wait to see it again. So, for those who have hang-ups about how you don't want to hear its better or more popular than this or that, don't get caught up in that nonsense.

While some people claim to hate CGI, there are those of us who consider it another tool to make a movie, but think it can be misused.I like a lot of superhero movies. I have been enjoying most of the Marvel Studio movies, but some are better than others. It turns out I like the big fight sequence in the first Avengers movie because it clearly takes place around Grand Central. I can relate to it, since I am a native New Yorker. I take pleasure in seeing how the Helmsley Palace tunnels are used, and the Pershing Overpass. The Spiderman movie with the elevated train along Canal Street annoyed me.There are lots of movies that use ""movie geography"" that makes no sense and they don't all use CGI. There was a Michael Keaton vehicle about twenty years ago called THE HARD WAY which annoyed me with its nonsensical geography. The problem is not CGI; It's using CGI or other techniques to enable bad scripts.","

"The Avengers","fatal_coates","1 May 2012","As AWESOME as expected. An immense lineup/casting, decent story and visuals that put Transformers blur to shame. Iron Man does take a fair chunk of the limelight, as expected (It felt like this was his third film, before that has even been released) but the others do get their fair share and have great entrances.Oh..the movie is very funny!! Iron man starts off initially, but Hulk sees to it, that he gets the last laugh.. and his latter scenes do dominate the tail end (Mark Ruffalo does a pretty decent job) Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye (seen briefly in Thor) makes Oliver's Green Arrow from DC, look pathetic. This movie along with his role in Mission Impossible 4 is definitely a precursor to his taking over the role as Bourne, and he's pumping up for that too.Speaking of the muscles in the film. ""Cap"" appears to have lost weight?? Chris Evans must not be working out as much, but Thor seems to have taken over in the gym as he's even bigger. Hulk is obviously the biggest but thats what CGI does for you.. Oh, and Iron Man appears bulkier?? like his suit needs to compete??! Scarlett Johannsson's ass get's a cameo in this film, I wonder how she felt about the camera's angle in all the 3D glory in one scene..Another new member to the cast, and good to see another Avenger's regular ~ Agent ""Maria Hill"" appears, played by a very fit looking Cobie Smulders (Robin from ""How I met your mother"" fame) She gets a fair chunk of the movie and action herself. Stellan Skarsgaard returns from Thor along with the villain most would have seen in the trailer, Loki. Potts & Coulson cameo.The ""one on one"" battles of many of the heroes is a sight to behold and are really a delight to watch. You get to see them throw everything at each other as you see them match up their strengths and their weaknesses. Also watch for the Cap / Iron Man combo towards the end of the film, memories from the past! Loved the film. Will no doubt be seeing it again.. Check it out!","

This is the movie that all the others made by Marvel Studios has been leading up to. This is what they have been aching to show us.I was pleased to learn that I would be given the chance to see the movie before its May release date in the United States, but despite my privileged opportunity, I went in with relatively low expectations. (It's just another superhero movie, but with a bunch of them at one time, right?)Wrong...If you are a fan of Marvel, superheroes, great CGI or just all-around intense action films, you MUST see Marvel's The Avengers. The CGI was the best I've seen in a long time, the fighting as intense as ever, and the plot is top-notch. But these things aren't the only aspects of the movie that make The Avengers great. For me, it was the characters. Yes, we've seen all these characters before. We've enjoyed their specific movies, but having them on screen together worked better than I could have imagined. In fact, that was why I was apprehensive at first. I had been afraid that perhaps one hero would take away more screen time than another. (We all have our favorites.) But this wasn't the case. Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), provided his much expected wit and humor for the film, causing the crowd to laugh on many occasions. The banter between Stark and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) flowed well and added a lot to the character depth. I wasn't sure how Thor (Chris Hemsworth) would be playing his part either. I thought he actually might be taking too much screen time from the others since his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), was the main antagonist, but this wasn't the case. I found myself most excited in the movie when Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) came on screen. His character was done so well for this movie. I found myself thrilled and even scared in some of his scenes.I must also mention here that Ruffalo did a superb job of taking Edward Norton's place as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. If there's one thing that annoys me about sequels, it's when they change actors, but I actually enjoyed Ruffalo better in this role.Of course you can't forget about Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Each of them played their part of the story wonderfully, though I found Sam Jackson's acting to be a little stale.I would say that if you haven't watched the other movies made by Marvel Studios that you might want to watch them. Most references will be lost on you if you don't. As far as screen time, it felt like every character got their time in the light. No one person stole the show, and just as Marvel intended, they ALL stole the show.There is one particular scene that I enjoyed where the camera panned to each hero, doing their own special moves, though it's hard to explain further than that without giving anything away. However, there were moments in the movie where I had to lean over to my wife and ask what someone was talking about, but these instances were minor.Obviously, if you care anything about Marvel movies, you're already planning to see The Avengers. If you haven't seen any of the other Marvel Studios films, take a weekend, watch them. Then go see The Avengers. I don't think you'll be sorry you did.","

"The Avengers","bryno92","9 September 2017","This is one of the most overrated movies I have seen. I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I did enjoy Spiderman 1, 2, and 3 as well as Ironman. I've never seen Thor or Captain America so I know I'm missing a little backstory, but I doubt it would add a lot to the experience in this movie. The story was sub-par and very predictable. There is also no sense of danger whatsoever since these superheroes are near invincible, which is why I tend to avoid superhero movies. Action scenes are therefore boring because you know the outcome 99/100 times. I laugh at why they even bother shooting guns at these guys. Do they really expect us to be on the edge of our seats? Yes, the visuals are decent but that's not what makes a movie. When comparing this film to Guardians of the Galaxy, it's no contest. GotG had drama, humor (that wasn't forced), a decent story, and fantastic visuals. If you are a Marvel fan, you will probably like this film simply because you love the characters. I was looking for something other than mindless action and unfortunately I did not get that.","

"The Avengers","John_T_Chance","26 April 2012","The Avengers is simply a superb movie in every way that matters. Forget comparing it to other films of the genre. I'll save that for a later date because it really isn't important. Judging it as a stand alone piece of entertainment, it's the best time I've had in theaters in a very long time. First off, forget what you think you know or expect because it operates at a higher level then anyone would have guessed. There is very little clichéd about the film. They establish their own universe by themselves but it is so aided by all the previous solo lead in films. If you've seen them all, you're in for a real treat with Avengers. If you haven't, you'll enjoy them MORE now watching them after Avengers. They fearlessly take the adventure wire to wire but manage to make you really care about every circumstance, character and scene. Every character is believable given the nature of the universe they establish. You really are drawn in to the world and to the each and every character right from the first act. That connection makes the action more meaningful, just like with the best of movies regardless of genre. The dialog has been called superb by fans and critics alike for a reason. The conflict and tension present between EVERYONE (protagonist, antagonist, friend, and foe) absolutely makes the film. The performances that stem off of that are all remarkable. The charisma this film packs, and there's plenty of it, comes from the flawless performances and the dialog. Also, the supporting cast is utilized perfectly. This is as good and as fun of a film that has ever been made. Bold statement, I know. I rarely rely on critics but when nine out of ten of them praise this film they are doing so for a reason. It makes you wonder what those few others saw or how much they were paid not to like an instant classic.","

"The Avengers","jfarms1956","7 April 2013","This movie is meant for those 8 and up. It is also meant for those who like SciFi Fantasy. The Avengers, a group of single comic book heroes, get together to save the world from Lokki. Samuel Jackson, the head of the Earth's protective forces, plays his role well. The characters are shallow, but let's face it, it's comic book time. It is fast paced and contains interesting toys and gadgets. It works as a great party movie. I loved the sets, the colors, and the characters, all in one film. Thor even comes to the rescue. All in all, the movie is very entertaining and is well worth its greater than 2 hour booty killer time. Get a bowl of pop corn and a group of friends, turn this movie into a SciFi party. I give it 5 thumbs up.","

After it was over, I feel like my mind exploded from the pure awesomeness and amazement that this film brought. Up until I saw this movie, ""The Dark Knight"" was my favorite superhero movie, but ""The Avengers"" beat it. How can you expect less from a movie that has Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor in it? It was the perfect blend of drama, action and comedy. Joss Whedon did what, in my opinion, no other director could have done. The pressure and hype surrounding this movie was immense and it delivered in every way. ""The Avengers"" is the type of movie that EVERYONE can enjoy, not just comic book fans.","

I can't believe how doll and bored I was during the 2 hours and 20 minutes playtime of the movie ..The directing was so bad and I think the director thinks the audience are so stupid or retarded to believe those cheap story lines or cheap jokes or even cheap plot .. The script was so cheap and boring and the characters didn't blend with each other at all ..I'm not even impressed by the special effects of the movie .. I think X-Men 3 or Spider Man showed a lot more special effect than this one .. I nearly enjoyed the last scene of the entire movie but this was not enough for such a movie who earned unbelievable high ratings ..Finally, when I knew that the director has never directed such super hero movies and he has only directed for the TV (like Buffy series), I know why this movie sucked !! still can't believe how it got 8.6 really !!","

"The Avengers","rossiepearson","5 December 2012","""The tesseract has awakened."" spoken in the opening scene, picks right up where 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and 'Thor' left off. S.H.E.I.L.D director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is forced to call upon earths mightiest hero's to stop the self outcast Asgardian Loki.Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, along with Black Widow and Hawkeye, are the only hope to save the world from an invasion, and boy do they in an instant superhero classic. Possibly the best thing about The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble in the UK) is that each hero has grounded powers the exception being Thor (unless you count Hulk's strength as a super power), which makes the Marvel hero's more believable than their DC. counterparts.There's drama, action, comedy, and some amazing CGI, and thankfully doesn't fall into the same category as the not so fantastic Fantastic 4 movies. Mark Ruffalo, replacing the underwhelming Ed Norton, excels as Bruce Banner/Hulk, which is without a doubt the best on screen version of the iconic hero after the awful 2003 'Hulk' movie and 2008's slightly improved 'The Incredible Hulk', as well as Ruffalo and co star Robert Downey Jr. Playing Tony Stark/Iron Man for the 4th time, having some fantastic chemistry in a scene on-board the Hellcarrier.Chris Evans plays Captain America perfectly as the man out of time, Chris Hemsworth is believable in his role as Loki's Brother (like in Thor) Scarlett Johansson is the surprise of the movie though with a lot of the action revolving around her Black Widow, the only major disappointment with The Avengers is that Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is underused. That being said every hero gets decent screen time to justify their appearance as well as everyone having a big part to play in the fantastic final sequence.However, The Avengers towers over every superhero movie in recent memory with the only real challengers being X-Men and The Dark Knight Trilogy, Joss Whedons hit is sure to please Marvel fans and the everyday movie goer. Next up for Marvel studios, Iron Man 3, cant wait.Best quote in the movie: Loki:""How desperate are you that you call upon such such lost creatures to defend you?""If you enjoyed watching: X-Men, Fantastic 4, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Incredible Hulk, you'll enjoy watching The Avengers (Avengers Assemble).","

"The Avengers","merdiolu","22 July 2012","Actor John Cusack once said that there are no more big production studios anymore. There are just a bunch of banks which provide funding/credits for projects and approve which script would be produced according to box office profit it is projected to generate. ( because Hollywood mentality became like : more money , bigger stars , bigger budget , bigger marketing , bigger blockbuster , bigger box office income that's all it matters ) Since comicbook / superhero genre is the newest and biggest market to be milked in popular culture for Hollywood in these harsh economy ; is it surprising that The Avengers , a childish intake about a bunch of ridiculously costumed ""Superheroes"" with one dimensional immature behavior getting together to repel an alien invasion ( AGAIN ! I think any actual alien seeing these alien invasion movies would not even close Earth ever again. Our ""always winning despite odds"" thing would be silly to them ) ? Unfortunetely not. This is another shallow seasonal product , another ""leave your brain at theater door"" movie aimed for Comic Con Convention fans. And I admit it is a BIG market.Just like most movies in this genre ( there are a few exceptions ) it has its own cliché's and tropes like they are coming out of a factory assembly line. At least director Joss Whedon ( a great TV writer/producer. I was a follower of Firefly and Dollhouse ) does not deny them and recognizing what they are , wears them at movie's sleeve. Bickering superheroes ( that's fine amusing with Whedonesque humor but humor got overwhelming and made ""superheroes"" childlike not multi dimensional characters ) , threat from outer space from a sneering arrogant enemy with another comic book costume ( at least Tom Hiddleston performed as well as he could with material he was given , but what the hell was Loki's motivation in conquering Earth ? ) , his boss with a digital voice , super secret ( American as usual ) military spy agency ( I can never understand American film industry's fetish of military - for a nation devoid of conscription ) , national stereotypes ( Russians are evil you know ) , hot ass kicking super agent babes ( Scarlett , Scarlett are you so desperate ? ) , Aryan looking superheroes from WW2 era ( Thor , Captain America , blond blue eyed , with whom we were fighting with anyway in that time ? Did you realize that there were no other ethnicity among these heroes like Oriental or Latin ) , Tony Stark rich jerk , Hulk a Doctor Bruce Banner marked with tragedy ( Mark Ruffolo is the only actor with proper character material and performs admirably in this ) , Hawkeye with baby faced Jeremy Renner ( I never warmed to that guy as an actor ) , and Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury big boss of agency with an eye patch ( no fake protez in nowadays ? ) because it looks cool , a final battle with lots of laser rays and CGI explosions without casualties in another American urban area ( this year it is New York City's trashing time ) , good vs evil , government made the mistake of launching a nuclear missile , it is averted , heroes are victorious blah blah it is the end....After all this sequence of predictable events where no protagonist was harmed and good guys win , what do we have ? An empty blockbuster which will make a big Box Office hit , probably a franchise but at the end an empty film. I can not wait in 20-30 years our grandchildren asking ""Is this the stuff your generation was watching ? No wonder everything really mattered like environment , economy , politics or simple psyche of human or society condition all of them gone hell. Your visual arts stopped reflecting them !""","

"The Avengers","jackharding89-1","27 April 2012","Consider the wit, brawn and pulse-pounding balls of both Iron Man movies and the spectacular Thor. Now consider the flaws and failings of Captain America, Fury and two incredibly average Hulk flicks. What are you left with? A question: where exactly was in-form writer/director Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble actually going to go? Down the pan? Or through the roof? Well, guess what? He's only gone and pulled it off. Ever since that teasing Nick Fury advent at the end of the first Iron Man, fans and filmgoers alike have been seeing-out the end credits of all subsequent Marvel flicks in hope of something (anything). What they got was everything. All signs pointed to an assemble, all roads lead to an Avengers movie. 5 years in the making? Try 50 for any Marvel mogul worth their salt will tell you a film's been coming since the early 1960's. And here it is: 4 big-buck franchises rolled into one: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk. Robert Downey-Junior, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and...Mark Ruffolo?! Ed Norton obviously didn't fancy this one but fear not, Hulk nuts, Ruffolo's twitchy turn makes for the best Banner yet. Anyway, throw these four in a room together and you're guaranteed two things; friction and fun. Our heroes square up, square off but in the end...well you can guess where it goes. The story? SHIELD head Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) enlists the fickle four along with Black Widow (Scarlet Johanson) to help save the world from Thor's bad brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Zero points for innovation, then. But if you thought Tony Stark suiting-up for the first-time was the coolest thing you've ever seen. Think again. Skilled sci-fi pen-cum-director Joss Whedon has well and truly arrived with this dizzyingly brilliant blockbuster that's more than the sum of it's fluctuating parts. Believe the hype, Avengers Assemble is a cast-iron hit. It's incredible. It's thunderous. It's furious, beaming, biting and marvellous. But enough puns, let's get down to business.Whedon has approached this four-way fusion in the right way: a strong and balanced emphasis on plot, dialogue and visuals, character development and chemistry. Too many cooks? Hell no. The big-name players work so well with one another it's actually surprising. The sheer sum and sense of one-liners and put-downs are just as memorable as the brutal, in-house beat-downs. Which is saying something when you consider scenes pitting Iron Man and Hulk against Thor are enough to send an entire generation of comic-book geeks into cardiac arrest.Downey-Junior's effortlessly cool turn on the sarci' Stark was always going to be the main lure, here, but to say he outshines his peers would be wrong. It's not all about the billionaire ball-buster. Everyone gets their 15 minutes. Both Hemsworth and Ruffolo (in particular) are bang on. Even the out-of-touch Cap' chips in with a few big, cheesy shots and Hiddleston's creepy demigod makes for a sharp villain.Granted, Whedon's tongue-in-cheek ethos and slapstick-like approach means the Avengers was never going to measure up to any of Nolan's Batman films. How many comic-book films (or films, in general) do!? Which is why there's not much point even trying to compare this breath-snatching Marvel muster to Nolan's Dark Knight rebirth. It's a kick-ass popcorn movie for young and old. Nothing more.That said, this hulking 142 minute feature is a stimulating affair with a freehold on the brash and the flash and the down-right hilarious. It's an absolute blast. Wildly entertaining, ridiculously awesome, the Avengers' is everything it should be: over-the-top, funny, cool, funny, loud, exciting, electric and did I mention funny!? Best comic book movie ever? No. Best Marvel production ever? Yeeeeee...no. X-Men: First Class still has that one tied-up but for such a question to prompt a pause for thought says an awful lot. Whedon's Assemble may not be the best superhero film out there but it is the funniest and probably the most entertaining. Definitely the coolest.Sure, there may be a limit to how many times you can watch superheroes kick the crap out of one and all. But you won't mind too much. Popcorn cinema doesn't get much better than this. Joss Whedon and co. have kicked this year's comic-book-busters off with a bang. Expect sequels.","

"The Avengers","williampsamuel","6 December 2014","Between a massive advertising blitz and some none-too-subtle hints that Marvel has been dropping in their films for the last four years, Joss Whedon's Avengers adaptation is one of the most eagerly anticipated blockbusters in recent memory. With most of Marvel's flagship characters- played by some of Hollywood's biggest stars- assembled together in a big budget production co-written and directed by the man responsible for Buffy and Firefly, the premise alone is enough to make fanboys swoon. This is a project with some very high expectations to meet. And having seen it, I for one would say that it has met them.It would not be much of a stretch to say that the Avengers is what every summer blockbuster wants to be. Given a few hundred million dollars and near total creative control, what director wouldn't want to make a film like this. In its two and a half hour running time, it delivers a coherent storyline, several likable, well developed protagonists, and enough action and explosions to show up Michal Bay.I mention this notorious director because his Transformers films, particularly the latter entries, have made millions on the idea that brainless fight scenes, gratuitous pyrotechnics, and more than a little T&A are all it takes to make an action movie; no acting, writing, wit, or originality needed. But Avengers shows that that's not true. Like a certain other superhero franchise due to release its final installment later this summer, Avengers works as much because of its human drama as its action and special effects. One of the main reasons the Fantastic Four movies didn't work, aside from weak screenplays and wooden acting, was that we never bought the idea that the actors on screen were a team. In the first film, they utterly lacked the kind of chemistry that would be expected of friends and co-workers. In the second entry, the chemistry was so forced that they seemed like a sitcom family. Avengers suffers from neither of these problems. Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downy Junior, Scarlett Johansen, Samuel L Jackson, and Mark Ruffalo not only shine on their own, but also work seamlessly together as part of a team, playing of each other's strengths and personalities.Between Stark's cynicism, casual arrogance, and roguish charm, Cap's loyalty and earnestness, Banner's demur, unobtrusive nerdiness, and Thor's zeal and new found humility, all of the leads get the chance to establish themselves as well rounded characters, and to remind us why we liked them in the first place. And like a real team, the characters don't always get along from the moment they first meet. They keep secrets. They question each others' motivations and commitments. They get on each others' nerves. And they certainly let their egos clash. In fact, some of the best fight scenes are between the heroes. But like real people, they put aside their differences and their egos. They learn to trust each other and work together, in a way not nearly as sappy or clichéd as it suddenly sounds when I'm writing it. The casting of Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury continues to seem like a better and better idea all the time. He might not be able to go all out, what with this being a PG-13 production, but there were moments that, for me at least, very much invoked fond memories of Pulp Fiction. Tom Hiddleston also does very good work as the villainous Loki. His air of condescension and supreme self confidence makes him instantly loathable, and the hint of jealousy and subtle desperation in his voice, together with his piercing, wide eyed stare gives the unmistakable impression that something is definitely not right inside his head. Watching the heroes give him the beating he deserves is a supremely satisfying experience.And like I said, the action is great too. The numerous fights and shootouts are excellently choreographed and filmed, and the climactic alien invasion is stunning in its size and complexity. It's like a non-sucky Battlefield LA, and the cost must have been astronomical. I'm also highly impressed at how long the film was able to keep the action and sense of excitement going. From start to finish, the final battle lasted roughly half an hour, without getting bogged down or becoming overly repetitive.Add in some typically Whedon-esque humor and a fair number of insider references to the comics, Avengers is mighty entertainment, and everything that fans could have hoped for. I look forward to Marvel's inevitable follow-up, and to the director's next project. I don't know why it's taken so long, but Joss Whedon has finally arrived in Hollywood, and I expect to see much more of him in the near future.","

"The Avengers","Movie_Muse_Reviews","8 June 2012","It has finally been assembled. Marvel's decision to make ""The Avengers"" might seem like the superhero equivalent of the ensemble movie ""Valentine's Day,"" or the theory that stuffing multiple popular actors into one movie is an adequate substitute for storytelling and makes it so marketable that no one could pass it up.While that's not necessarily not true of Marvel's super plan five years in the making, ""The Avengers"" means something more to comic and superhero fans; it is a culmination of a lifetime of anticipation that does in fact have a historical precedent set by Marvel Comics. Essentially, this movie is a collective nerd-gasm, but whether you're part of it or not, there's plenty to love about how geek godfather Joss Whedon tackles this gargantuan task.Still, it's pretty amazing what bundling seven or so of the most beloved comic characters of all time into one package can do when it comes to creating an entertaining diversion. Many folks will nitpick at ""The Avengers"" script from now until eternity, but something needs to be said for the experience of being so awe-stricken that you couldn't care about those things if you tried. There's no shame in covering up ""flaws"" with entertainment, especially when you deliver that entertainment with a level of quality rivaled by few blockbusters of this scale.""The Avengers"" is a near-perfect execution of giving the people what they want. If you had to make a list of what you wanted from an ""Avengers"" movie, Whedon and Marvel would appear to have read your mind. The action sequences blow every previous superhero film out of the air, land and sea, the wit and humor come from more than just a series of punchlines or catch phrases, and all the characters get a chance to shine from an action and development perspective.Story is secondary to achieving those goals. Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) power-obsessed brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has made a deal with an alien race known as the Chitauri to destroy Earth so he can rule it. He breaks into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and steals the Tesseract, an object at the center of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" that has the power to open a gateway through which the Chitauri can invade. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), realizing Earth is about to be at war with an unstoppable force, summons Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), a displaced Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor in hopes they can place nice and band together to stop Loki.So you have high stakes (global destruction), and a force powerful enough to justifiably bring all these heroes together. That's all you really need. The script properly gives each hero reasons to fight and a personal journey, something to overcome. All this for seven characters in a 140-minute runtime. Even though we're building up to yet another movie climax that involves the destruction of a major American city by hostile alien forces, it's still this unique grouping of characters that changes the whole game.As someone who seems to specialize in creating projects that develop cult followings, Whedon was really a perfect choice to write and direct. Despite what one would assume to be a lot of pressure, you never get the sense that ""The Avengers"" is trying too hard. The balancing act of all these characters might have seemed too tall an order for any one man, yet with actors really dedicated to the souls of their characters, Whedon and the cast pack in so much into even the smallest of exchanges.One character the movie excels at in particular is The Hulk. Ruffalo commands the role of Banner as if he was the one who played him in the first two ""Hulk"" features. The script paints him as the team's secret weapon, but also as the most volatile link in the chain. Some fear the green monster, others (Tony Stark) try to provoke him. Either way, despite sharing screen time, this Hulk is both more brutal and emotionally accessible than ever before. More than any other character, you'll end up most curious about what Marvel might do with him next.In general, the lack of time needing to be spent on plot development gets rationed off to all the characters, allowing the third-act action to pay off in more terms than simply eye candy. Each hero has a personal story arc or obstacle to overcome, whether its Tony Stark proving he can set aside his ego or Captain American understanding that he can be relevant in the 21st Century.With so many heroes in one film, Hiddleston had to bear a ton of weight as Loki, creating a presence that could balance out all these good guys. Although not much of a physical threat, his The Joker-like move to allow himself to be imprisoned gives him the fuel to be cunning and unpredictable in performance and in actuality.From a pure entertainment perspective, ""The Avengers"" should be considered king of all superhero movies. What it lacks in thematic and character depth it makes up for with action and humor. Whedon writes so expertly around clichés and identifies ways to make the film naturally funny, and the way the action scenes are edited together, there's no confusion in regard to what's going on despite the chaos of the Chitauri invasion scene.Marvel deserves all the credit in the world for building to this point and delivering precisely what fans wanted. Although anyone can enjoy this romp, not just those who saw both ""Iron Man"" films, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America,"" there's no doubt the legwork in those films makes it so much easier to enjoy the entire dynamic of ""The Avengers."" What a momentous achievement from a business, filmmaking and audience perspective.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com","

"The Avengers","ritera1","24 May 2012","I don't get it.Not that it was a bad movie. It was fun. It was okay.But some surprisingly poor filmmaking. It doesn't help that I loathe hand-held camera. You spend all this money and then muddy up the shots with a hand-held? It's the cancer on the testicles of cinematography. Buy a dolly, or tripod or Steadicam.I'm just glad that I didn't see this in 3D (which is another head-scratcher for me). Stargate or Independence Day was shot better. Any Hong Kong action movie is shot better. Any Jackie Chan movie is shot better.The story was better than average. A good amount of very bad and stilted dialog, though. Loki's ulterior motive on being captured was amazingly transparent.Acting was generally good. I don't know if you call what Downey does as ""acting"". It's him being charming, which works most of the time. But Scarlette? A looker but not getting much better at her ""craft"".And I thought it was just silly to see her face-off with the alien invasion with a handgun.And did Hawkeye's arrows magically replenish themselves 3, 4, 5 times during the final battle? Hemmesworth will be a very good actor in ten years. But he's okay now. But too small to be Thor, though.And please! How was the final battle not a carbon copy of Transformers 3? I liked Serenity. And Cabin in the Woods. But I think Josh was in over his head on this.","

"The Avengers","Meven_Stoffat","6 May 2012","My inner child is something I value most, and that inner child remembers my days of being a little kid and playing with my Iron Man and Captain America toys, as well as wishing I was the Incredible Hulk. I also remember watching the Hulk cartoons and begging my parents to get me the latest issue of of the next Captain America comic books. So as you can tell, I'm a comic books have played a huge role in my childhood, and that being said, it was with great excitement that I awaited The Avengers. Having seen all the Avengers movies until then and owning them all on blu-ray, I remember even watching them all up until Thursday May 3rd, which was when the midnight premiere took place. My buddy and I even wore Iron Man masks to the screening.I'm most happy to report, to say The Avengers did not disappoint is an unforgivable understatement. It may just be the best comic book movie I've ever seen. It shines dozens of lamps on The Dark Knight and it makes the previous Avengers movies (even Thor, which I loved despite not having been familiar with the Thor mythos before seeing it) look like the Fantastic Four movies. Everything about this movie was pitch perfect. Starting with the script. Joss Whedon had penned the script and it's obvious he has done his homework on not just the mythos and everything else in the world of The Avengers, but also what the audience loves about the heroes and expects from a movie about The Avengers. Everyone was given a sense of humour and played their cards right- Tony Stark was his usual lovable jerk self, and had his typical attitude problems that were hard not to love. He was given a great amount of action as well and the scene near the end where he pushes the nuclear bomb into the portal was purely beautiful intensity. Captain America was his usual kickass self, and every one of his action scenes were hard to not love. Thor was hilarious as well and his scenes with Loki were just amazing. Particularly the scene near the end on Stark tower where he forces Loki to watch the mayhem going on in the city and asks ""Is this what you want?"". Aso, FINALLY the Hulk has had justice done. He's given a sense of humour, which the other movies absolutely failed on. I'm happy to report the movie did not fail there. And who can forget the dialogue? Classic Avengers dialogs, down to the last inch. ""We need a plan of attack!"" ""I have a plan. Attack."" and ""WhTs the matter, not fond of thunder and lightning?"" ""I don't like what comes after.""The characterization is really what counts here too. Obviously if you're going to a movie called The Avengers for a character study you're going to the wrong movie (and you need to lay off the artsy movies too, as they're clearly doing serious stuff to your brain), but for the type of movie it is, it's done supremely well. Each character is unique in their own right- I've already mentioned the eponymous superheroes, but Black Widow is one sexy and fun character that's hard not to love. Her action scenes are just incredible and her backstory, while thankfully kept to a minimum is interesting as hell. Hawkeye is stone cold and scary in the first half when  possessed by Loki, then is cool and badass near the end when he resides to kick some Loki butt. The movie is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen thanks to lots of clever, Whedonian humour and appropriately placed Comic book style exaggeration. The scene where Hulk smashes Loki around like a rag doll made me laugh harder than anything in 21 Jump Street and any other comedy this year. And the scene where Hulk sucker punches Thor!The performances are amazing as well. Pure commitment from all involved, with Downey Jr., Evans and Hemsworth, as well as Johannson, Smulders, Jackson, Hiddleston and Renner giving amazing performances all, but Ruffalo is the real surprise here. He brought something new to the table here as Hulk- every line he spoke sounded like he was trying hard to hold back his inner monster and boy was it chilling. His monologue about how he tried committing suicide was delivered very chillingly beautifully. He was the biggest surprise and got everything about the Hulk perfect. Props to Ruffalo for FINALLY getting The Hulk exactly right!!!I'm going to conclude my review with one more little piece of praise. Whedon is my favourite TV writer And he's managed to make me proud to be a comic book nerd. Justice was done to the best superheroes ever and I can tell superhero movies are going to not be the same ever again. A big thanks to Ll involved for the commitment and true dedication to making this movie possible, and the great success it was. I've seen this movie twice already and I can't wait to see it again and again. Now I've only got two more words to say: AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!","

"The Avengers","achyutha037","27 April 2012","I was eagerly waiting for this movie. But after seeing the Marvel movie, Captain America: the first Avenger, Thor and Incredible hulk- I thought that the movie would be not as good as the hype it carried for so many years. But still due to Robert downey jr. i wanted to see this film. OK, i admit it, i was blown away by the movie in terms of Action, and of course Humor. Director Joss Whedon, directed this movie so BRILLIANTLY, that there are very little or NO flaws. Sufficient Screen time has been provided for each of the SUPERHEROES. but the Mighty guys, Iron man(RDJ) and the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) steal the show. Thor(Chris Hemsworth) was too, brilliant. In this movie, you'll see more of Captain America(Chris Evans) than his solo movie, which is really great. AND, Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson) kicks the ass off whoever she fights with. Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) is not at all Underused, his Powers were shown superbly. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) was great with his Initiative. And here it is, the main villain, Loki(Tom Hiddleston), steals the show with his mischievous and No-worries personality, he fits into the role perfectly. On the Whole, the cast were perfect, with each of them fitting into the characters with ease.The humor and witty one liners are splendid. Don't expect it to be DARK with no humor like the Dark knight, instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the film in the auditorium. Many people have started comparing Avengers with The dark knight, but what I SAY is these two are COMPLETELY different type of film, and comparing the two is not justified. Still if you compare, Avengers is better than Dark knight. Due to the reason that Avengers can be enjoyed by each and every person, it has action and Humor, both at equal Quantities.As for iron man, Robert downey jr IS Iron man, no other person can do that role so perfectly. Unfortunately, RDJ is about to leave the franchise after IRON MAN 3, i request the iron man fans to please him not to leave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films, including AVENGERS 2. :)I will ensure to each and every person who is reading this that, this film will never disappoint you, not even a moment. 100%. :) Go watch it without doubt. I will say that, this movie will definitely touch or cross the 1Billion mark and becomes on of the highest grossing films in the film history. Verdict: 10/10 stars, A+++++, EXCELLENT.","

"The Avengers","Thanos_Alfie","11 February 2022","""The Avengers"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch the mightiest heroes of Earth come together in order to defend it by Loki (Thor's brother) and his alien army. They have to fight as a team if they want to win and save humanity.I liked this movie very much because it was the first movie that many of the Marvel heroes that we had already watched their films came together and formed The Avengers. It contained plenty of action scenes, the plot was very interesting and it also contained some unexpected plot twists that made it even more interesting. In addition to this, the direction which was made by Joss Whedon was very good and he did an excellent job on the way he combined all these amazing heroes. The interpretations of Robert Downey Jr. Who played as Tony Stark, Chris Evans who played as Steve Rogers, Chris Hemsworth who played as Thor, Scarlett Johansson who played as Natasha Romanoff and Mark Ruffalo who played as Bruce Banner were very good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Avengers"" is a nice, entertaining movie to spend your time with and I am sure it will amaze you.","

"The Avengers","kevinxirau","7 May 2012","Wow, it has finally arrived. Marvel has had one hell of a project, coming up with movies exploring the origin stories of some of the most iconic superheroes of all time while adding small but subtle connections to each other as a way to show fans what is coming over the horizon. The result is an all-out marvel mash as Earth's mightiest heroes have come together to face a threat no one hero could possibly face alone. They are the Avengers.Loki, the god of mischief, has come to conquer the Earth with an unspeakable alien force to back him up. To make matters worse, he has obtained an ancient artifact with virtually limitless power as his disposal. In desperation, Nick Fury, director of the peace-keeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., assembles together the greatest heroes the world has ever seen: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Incredible Hulk. If these extraordinary independent individuals can learn to work together, their combined might be enough to conquer this global threat.This is every comic book geeks dream team and dream movie. The faces we have all grown up with and come to love finally together in one film. Normally, such a task is highly risky because not only do the filmmakers have to be faithful to the comics, but also appeal to what the fans would want to see in The Avengers, not to mention avoid any plot holes. Thankfully, this movie does it all plus more. It is, dare I say it, incredible! The action scenes are some of the best in the superhero genre, lots of shooting, punching, and, of course, smashing. Things get really insane and everything in sight gets totally destroyed as the forces of good and evil duke it out. All the characters have practically equal back story, interactions, and amount of fighting, even characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. With this, not one seems left out or doesn't get enough of these elements. Dialog is written very well and there's a surprising amount of comedy throughout the film (and it's hard not to laugh with it). There's lots of great moments and none of it seems the least bit corny.In conclusion, this will satisfy anyone, especially the fans. Everything people hope to see is brought to life and it kicks serious butt. With fantastic action scenes, excellent special effects, well-written script, cool music, and surprisingly great comedy, The Avengers is sure to satisfy in every way. On a scale of one to ten, I would give this movie a twenty (it's a shame I can't physically give such a rating)! Go check out this awesome flick and enjoy! AVENGERS, ASSEMBLE!","

"The Avengers","Eternalkid","15 July 2012","I felt compelled to review this, having just seen it 2 months after its release - the wait was agonising at times, but worth every second! Very few films have made me beam and laugh and cheer and clap so much. Terminator 2. Batman Begins. Iron Man. And a select handful of others.The Avengers is a little bit of a slow burner, but with delightful ingredients on the screen, it makes for a fabulous, explosive and tasty finish.I'd have to say, it was superbly orchestrated from start to finish, and the highlights must go to the Thor/Iron Man scuffle, and the grand finale which has - surprisingly - The Hulk as its main and certainly best attraction. After two average Hulk films, THIS one more than compensates for them, with humour (""I'm always angry"") and punchiness (it stopping one of the megamonsters and slapping Loki around as it he were a Barbie doll - awesome!).Other highlights are the Cap telling the NYPD what to do and Loki's masterful interrogation by Romanoff.All in all, the best action I've seen in a few years. Cannot wait for them coming up against Thanos in AV2!","

"The Avengers","kosmasp","7 June 2012","I'm still having my fingers crossed that the Avengers will overtake Avatar as the most successful movie ever (until another movie burst and takes over that is). It would be such a great success and I would be so happy for Joss Wheddon. A real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time. As we speak Avengers has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll. And all that is more than deserved. While I don't think it is necessary to have watched the other Marvel movies so far (especially not the different Hulks), the Avengers will make you want to watch more (look at your local video store for confirmation!).All the characters are here and have their moments. Maybe Thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise. But then again, he is god, so he wouldn't care anyway. Mark Ruffalo is winning (as a Charlie Sheen would say) with his performance as Hulk/Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is entertaining as ever. And even if some claim that Captain America is not needed, I think he brings Gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an Iron Man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole Crew. Chris Evans is perfect for that role.The movie has been criticized for the weak villain. I think that does injustice to the movie. While the characters (bar Hulk?) have been introduced to you, this still is a forming of a group. It is more about the Avengers, than it is about any villain. And I don't think Tom H. Loki is that weak (even if Hulk does disagree).I watched the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Time flies by and you don't realize how fast 150 minutes can go by. I like the fact, that Joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid. So maybe some will not get the joke/bet between Capt. Americas character and Sam Jacksons character (though I reckon it won't be many), but I loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of it.Since this is a Marvel movie, you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end. A friend of mine knew immediately what (or rather who) we saw there. You'll find the answer on the internet. That scene came in between the credits. There is another scene after the credits which as of yet, was not shown in Europe, but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release (DVD, Blu Ray or whatever comes next). I'm so looking forward to it ... oh and the 3D is nice, but its the story/characters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ...","

Boring. This movie. Really boring.I think I fell asleep 3 times, for about 15 minutes total. Its hard to sleep too long because every now and then there is an explosion or some other loud whammo.The Dark Knight was WAY better than this. Spiderman was WAY better than this.Is it worthy of 1 star? No. Maybe it should be 3 or 4... But I'm giving the 1 to help offset some of the insane 10s I'm seeing on here. Seriously, there are people on IMDb saying its the best movie they have ever seen in their life. Really? Really!? Really. O.o I smell something fishy going on around here.The movie was completely vapid, boring, convoluted. Nothing about the movie was new or interesting.I'm assuming the score has been manipulated by social media, hopefully IMDb will do something about it.

The answer is simple action, action and action.The best part of the movie is it's tight screenplay which will make you glued to the screen, with lots of high octane drama, fights, bullets and bombs to give the movie a larger than life effect.Robert Downey Jr. is charismatic as always, Chris Hemsworth and Evans does their job with perfection, The beautiful Scarlet Johansson is as dangerous as the superheros, Jeremy Renner leaves impression with his gray shaded character and Mark Ruffalo 'The other guy' is also impressive. But not to forget Tom Hiddleston the only bad guy stands tall in the group of powerful superheros.This is one of the best superhero movie which highlights the characters of all the superhero nicely and will leave you spellbound.","

"The Avengers","aharmas","6 May 2012","If there's a genre that's evolving and becoming better and better in the last decade, it's the adventure/comic genre; not solely a result of better CGI and cinematographic techniques, but there is also much better writing and acting, and in previous years, efforts by Nolan and Joe Johnston have been bypassed by critic and association entities because they are not a specific type of picture. It is certainly my hope this brilliant film doesn't suffer the same fate for it's great cinema all the way.With a superb cast that appears to embody each of the super heroes, and most intriguingly, their own stunts, we are treated to a very exciting two hours plus at the movies where the Earth is once again in danger of being overcome by an alien race, and somehow, story lines from several films are tied together neatly. Eventually, they all become a cohesive whole, and the results are MARVELous!! The film is terrific, and it might not reach the levels of perfection that we saw in ""The Dark Knight"", a movie so magnificent in its structure and sustained by terrific writing and acting. There's certainly no villain like the Joker here, but the evil forces are sufficient enough to warrant a cry for help, so that we need our heroes to come and kick some alien butt. It's definitely a showcase for all involved: Renner, Downey (much warmer) than in any of his previous turns as Ironman, Johanssen is magnificent, Evans is fantastic, Hemsworth is royal like in his turn, but the best turn out there is sheer force of nature that Ruffalo gives to the Hulk. He certainly walks away with the picture, yet everyone else gives him plenty of competition for the spotlight.The film is a crowd pleaser, with plenty of terrific set pieces, leading to an extraordinary third act, a piece of cinematic action rarely seen before, where every element moves so smoothly, it can make your heart soar when you see what really good films can achieve. It certainly doesn't remind me of some of the films that have been recognized in the last decade, as the best that cinema can offer. Good film do not have to be serious; they have to be well made, regardless of what the subject matter is, and ""The Avengers"" once have proved just how amazing solid script writing (by one person, not a whole team of creative ideas) can give you when you combine with top of the line special effects. It's truly a joy to see Jackson sharp tuning a role we have seen before, but it's now full of pizazz.There are some terrific possibilities coming our way later this year, and I am looking forward to the amazing offerings by Nolan, Scott, and Sonnenfield, but they have a battle uphill trying to match this wonderful movie. Watch, learn, and learn to give credit where credit is due. This is cinema at its best.","

""Avengers"" is arguably the worst yet.The film reminded me of Transformers 3, with constant explosions and destroyed buildings, as well as ubiquitous 3D scenes which actually don't look very realistic. This movie is a gimmick.The plot is utterly cliché and haphazard. The dialogue, save for a few funny lines, is very bad. No great acting except for Loki, and he seems out of place among wooden performances. Even the editing was pretty lazy. This ""movie"" seems more like a TV serial with forced dialog.The entire film is basically just a vehicle to watch the different heroes fighting with each other.","

It's amazing seeing Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron man together fighting side by side & we also have the Awesome Hawkeye & Black Widow joining the fight.The cast is excellent, we have the legendary Samuel l Jackson as Nick Fury the guy who Assembles the Avengers when a threat against earth rises.
Chris Evans is perfect as Steve Rogers aka Captain America he's my favourite of the Avengers team & one of my favourite Marvel characters ever along with The Punisher & Daredevil.
Evans has the perfect balance of lost & weary old school soldier & also in control tough & confident leader when needed, he's a fantastic complex character.
The whole cast is perfect though, Thor is fun, tough & loyal & that's down to a great performance from Chris Hemsworth!!!
Robert Downey Jr is perfect as rich guy super hero Iron man, he's playful, funny & super smart it's a fantastic performance.
Mark Ruffalo is excellent as the big mighty incredible Hulk, another perfect performance bringing nice guy scientist Bruce Banner to life & the big green beast within.
The absolutely beautiful Scarlett Johansson is outstanding as extremely tough & super smart Black Widow, she's extremely Dangerous & extremely brave.
Also we have the excellent marksman Hawkeye played perfectly by Jeremy Renner who is probably my 2nd fave character after Captain America, Hawkeye is a Cool, tough & loyal warrior.
This first Avengers film is truly OUTSTANDING!!!
A big piece of pure fantasy entertainment & a near perfect super hero film.

"The Avengers","The_Dead_See","11 May 2012","I'm not the biggest fan of the setup movies for The Avengers. I think they're tremendously hit and miss, and not through some comic book fan need for accuracy but as stand alone films on their own merits. See, I like the odd comic book, but I'm certainly not a comic book fan. What I am a fan of is good, solid storytelling. You know - characters that evolve, logically sound motivations and tensions, good pacing, an antagonist defeated through skill rather than luck - that sort of thing. From this perspective, the setup movies fell mostly flat for me. Iron Man was fabulous fun but it's sequel was poor. The Hulk was meh. Captain America spent far too long without any actual Captain America in it, and Thor - hmmm was just a bit of an all round mess and lacked even eye candy set pieces to elevate it. So back a few years ago when it first became whispered in nerd circles that The Avengers was going to surface to tie all these movies together, I didn't really get much of a sense of excitement. A few years later, as the end credits rolled on Thor, I pretty much made up my mind that The Avengers movie was going to screw up badly. If the industry couldn't pull off a good movie with just one hero in it, how could they ever pull off one with six?Then I heard that Joss Whedon was writing and directing and my interest rekindled. After all, I've seen him handle symphonies of characters before - with the Scooby Gang and the Serenity crew. If anyone could do it, Whedon could.But still I was wary. Just didn't want to let my expectations get too high - superhero movies are notoriously difficult to get right after all. Maybe even Whedon would screw it up.Boy was I wrong.I don't think I've had this much fun at the cinema in years. Since the first Matrix movie in fact which was, what? Twelve years ago? (God I'm old). The Avengers had everything a good popcorn flick needs - major action setpieces, beautiful sfx, some neat and effective humor, yada yada yada. But none of that is what left my jaw on the floor. What really blew me away - and what compelled me to come here and write the first review I've done on IMDb in quite some time (years probably) - was just how perfectly done the script was. Every character is given their moment to shine, every interaction is perfectly in tune, this whole movie was the audiovisual equivalent of listening to a perfectly wrought symphony. Every moving part clicked into place so well that you couldn't have taken out one single character - not even the arguably 'second tier' characters of Hawkeye and the Black Widow - without the whole thing coming apart. This is no Batman or Pirates of the Caribbean, or Spider Man movie; because while those multi-protagonist movies were all quite adequate and entertaining, the characters and plots were often an out of focus mess. Not so in The Avengers. Everything clicks so perfectly I can't even find the words to describe it. You'll just have to go see it for yourself to see what I mean.","

I went into it expecting not to like it much, and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy, a whole lot of posturing, and a silly storyline involving silly characters.Then things changed. They started to pick up, and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour, an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant, wide-scale mayhem, but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory.And yes, I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like, really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure, I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing, overblown CGI mayhem, replete with a silly, buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride.","

"The Avengers","neil-476","27 April 2012","Having cracked the problem of super-hero movies with successful runs on Spider-Man and X-Men (both franchises contracted out to major studios), Marvel went independent with assorted features based on their lesser known characters - Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - and did very well with a series of one-off movies which were commercially and critically well received. Importantly, these movies were conceived, from the very start, as essential building blocks moving towards this film, which achieves a cinematic first by bringing together a number of characters who have headlined their own movies and who now appear together (OK, so I'm ignoring Abbott and Castello's role in bringing together Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman. So sue me).The problem was always going to be how to deal with bringing together such powerful characters in a team movie when every one of them is a strong enough character to have carried his own movie - surely either they are all downgraded to sidekicks of each other? Or else the movie will be nothing but a testosterone-fulled p*ss*ng contest? It turns out that it is both these things, but the mix is beautifully judged. By entrusting the script and direction to Joss Whedon - ace script doctor, master at working with ensemble pieces, and lifelong comic lover (and excellent comic writer, one might also add), the balance - for balance was always going to be critical in this movie - is perfect.I won't say anything very much about the content, because there is so much in this movie to enjoy. It is simply full of small touches among the bombast, which will bring delight to the average viewer who likes an action-packed blockbuster, and absolute joy to comic lovers. The characters which have been established in the previous movies are all here, and they are all the same people - they haven't been changed for The Avengers, but they have more depth and there is also character development here. The script is terrific and the action is stunning. Oh, and hang on until after the main titles have finished at the end...By the way, thank you so much for saddling this movie in the UK with the ridiculous title ""Marvel Avengers Assemble"" (which communicates even less to a non-comics audience than ""The Avengers"") and also depriving us of the iconic Avengers logo and title on the main title screen.","

"The Avengers","Bascoda","26 May 2012","OMG Scarlett Johansson looks good in tight black pants!! OK, enough of that. This is as good a translation of comic book to film as any of us are likely to see - ever. Each of the actors chosen for the roles draws their character on like a glove, and the fit is perfect. This is what separates The Avengers from most other movies in this genre - the characters have depth, their interaction with each other is real and eminently believable, and the willful suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy this type of movie is so effortless as to be unnoticeable. The CGI effects are spectacular, as is to be expected, and kudos to the designers for some really over-the-top bad guys and hardware. If I have one minor quibble, it is that I wanted more from Colbie Smulders as agent Hill. Her screen presence is so intense that I kept waiting (and wanting) more from her than to just be Samuel Jackson's aide-de-camp. Ah well, maybe next time.","

"The Avengers","mounirrmaged","10 August 2016","The avengers. One of the most hyped comic book movies of all time. After years of build-up with solo movies, the avengers is born. Is it good? does it still hold up? the answer is no. I admit, the first time i saw this movie in theaters, i was having a blast and enjoying it very much. However, the film gets worse for me each time i give it a second watch. The film is centered around Loki(played by Tom Hiddleston), who wants to take over the world, while the avengers work out their ways to stop him. It is as generic and lazy as it sounds. The film barely has any story or even character development/interaction. It's nothing but one liners and action. None of the characters have a defined personality. Tony Stark is a one dimensional clown, Thor is has the charm of a wood that speaks in a Shakespearean way, black widow and hawkeye are nearly the same, only their gender are different. Hulk has his moments, and captain America is one of the most boring comic book characters i have ever seen in this movie. It's basically a Michael Bay movie minus the women objectifying, but same level of obnoxious and out dated film making. One of the most overrated trash movies i have ever seen. This movie gets 3/10 from me","

"The Avengers","paul_haakonsen","18 August 2012","First of all I must admit that I am not much particularly a fan of superheroes in general, but I have seen the movies leading up to this, simply because they were available and I had the time. And I had read up on the hype around this movie, so I might as well give it a go as well.And as a fairly non-superhero kind of guy, well I must say that ""The Avengers"" was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie. The story was, for me at least, rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal. Sure, it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior movies.The effects in ""The Avengers"" were top notch, as to be expected from a movie of this caliber. Lots of really great effects and visuals. However, when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly, I was ready to turn off the movie. That was just silly. But I decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scene.However, one thing did make me wonder, with all the destruction in New York, you didn't see a single civilian getting hit or killed in any way, that was just stupid, especially with so many people living there. In fact, you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie, which was sort of lame.Another thing puzzled me, when Bruce Banner turned into The Hulk for the first time in the movie, he was out of control, smashing everything and everyone in sight. But somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time. That just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformation.And as with the previous Marvel movies with these characters, they had some great performances to the movie. I think that it was actually Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the most.""The Avengers"" was good entertainment, even for an anti-superhero guy like myself. Great action. Lots of destruction. And great special effects.","

"The Avengers","cidliq","6 July 2012","THE GOOD- I was truly impressed with how well they pulled this movie off. The visual effects were all very clean. The characters were portrayed by the actors very well. This movie was loaded with action keeping everyone's attention glued to it. I was so impressed, I went to the theater to see it more than once and recommended it to everyone. I was very happy to see most of the actors return to portray their characters in this. THE BAD- Most characters.... The hulk was my big issue here. Mark Rufflo was good with the Bruce Banner character but the graphics for the hulk just did not meet the level of the movie starring Edward Norton. But it was not so bad that I could not look past it and really find enjoyment. I will most definitely go see another installment of Avengers.","

Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.I want to first address the IMDb rating on this film. Currently, it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now, no matter how good you think it is, does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean, really? I grew up reading comic books, so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base, which is good, because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is, for example, it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities? Particularly the Hulk, who is not a team player. This was addressed.","

"The Avengers","wuytskristof-823-169489","13 September 2012","I heard people call The avengers a tour de force, a perfect box-office bonanza, the wickedest ride of their lives and best movie ever! I can only assume that every single one of them is a comic book freak and are all obsessed by every Marvel hero and villain. I can tell you I'm a movie buff but I'm not a comic book freak. In my opinion that shouldn't matter because dark knight for instance, is one of my favorite movies of all time. I know it's not from Marvel but DC comics but I also liked the first iron man movie (he turned into a narcissistic bastard after the first and I didn't like that character development) So I'm not gonna write a movie off just because I'm not a huge Marvel fan.But after 2 1/2 hours of sitting through the deluge of explosions, ""witty"" banter, and generic story-telling. I was happy the movie ended, all around me there were people applauding and telling each other what an awesome movie they just saw. My plan was just to go home and put on a real movie. With plot twists and character development, both things I missed in the avengers. You could say it's fast paced but if the story doesn't grab you by the balls, it's all irrelevant. The only thing the movie had going for itself was that it was hilarious, too bad it didn't mean to be.I knew after five minutes that the movie wasn't going to live up to the hype. And it was only downhill from there to be honest. The last sequence was the worst in my book. The alien invasion was so stupid, we were all wondering what was going to come through the black hole. And what came to wipe out all of humanity? A few hundred Chitauri, wow... is that an invasion? Six avengers got their stuff together and mobbed the floor with them. That was a huge anti-climax!I think this movie is very overrated and only worth a view if you're tired and want some brainless 'entertainment', other than that it really is only for the comic book geeks. And maybe teenagers who've been brainwashed with years of Asian (fighting) cartoons. Oh yeah, the movie I watched when I got home was snatch!","

"The Avengers","DICK STEEL","30 April 2012","Although if I may add a little personal bias here, The Avengers is perhaps the Hulk movie that never got made until now, leaving the other two films starring Eric Bana and Edward Norton biting the dust. When Mark Ruffalo was announced as taking over the mantle of the gamma powered being with anger management issues, I'm sure many like myself would have been bewildered, but Ruffalo shows why he's the best Hulk just yet, and is a mean Bruce Banner as well. We get back to seeing Banner being a scientist, enlisted not for his raging abilities, but that of being the go to expert on gamma radiation. That doesn't mean he's a pushover when it comes to the crunch, and with Ruffalo being motion captured rather than having the Hulk purely CG, is something different, not to mention the countless of cool scenes the big monster gets himself into thanks to his powered abilities. In short, it's almost Hulk 3: Hulk and Friends instead.But I digress. The Avengers finally made it to the big screen after all those stingers in the various Marvel movies gave audiences a tease for years. The wait is over, and boy, was it worth the wait. We welcome back the familiar faces in Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), as well as the SHIELD agents in director Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Coulson (Clark Gregg) and new addition Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), as well as bit roles to others such as Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Jarvis (Paul Bettany), Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) stringing all of them into a fit as the villain hell bent on enslaving all of humanity, with help from an alien race army of course. Talk about an ensemble cast!And true to form, Joss Whedon devotes adequate time to almost all of the Avengers, and making this more like an extension of their individual films as we dwell a little bit more into the background and issues each hero face, some which we know of from their earlier arcs that thankfully don't get rehashed too much save for certain quick montage sequences. Tony Stark has just about finished his research on renewable energy, not forgetting a new version of his armour that we'd get to see here (the Mark VII), Captain America still finding his feet in the real world and showing shades of the leader he's growing into, and Thor continuing his bickering with half brother Loki that culminates into having him being sent back to Earth to take his villainous brother back to Asgaard once again. The quieter moments in the film provides plenty of opportunity for characterization, and Whedon doesn't disappoint in showing how well he's comfortable and knowledgeable about each one of them from comic folk lore.And when it comes to what fan boys all over the world are clamouring for, Whedon doesn't disappoint when it comes to larger than life action that pits the Avengers either against each other, playing into the hand of Loki in his divide and conquer strategy, and when they finally get their act together to cooperate and save the world. The Team Ups here, either in twos or threes, is fun in every essence of the word, pitting each hero against each other, or when cooperating to address problems that require their unique, combined abilities. And there's always good natured humour around the corner when you least expect, some really taking you by surprise, yet is still keeping true to the nature of each character. If you'd think the bulk of the wisecracks come from Stark, well, think again!Whedon also makes it a conscientious point never to rehash what had already been seen in the individual movies, but providing a lot more and expanding the scope from what had been done before. I assure you that you'd haven't seen the Hulk do battle like what he does here, easily becoming a fan favourite and stealing the thunder from the rest, and of course a lot more from Captain America whose own film saw a limited variation in his fighting abilities, as compared to what he finally does here. Thor with Mjolnir is another dimension and class altogether, while Hawkeye finally saw some battles of his own after his short cameo appearance in Thor where he didn't fire a single projectile. The biggest challenge and change of course was on Tony Stark, and it would be interesting to see if this change, about being less egoistical and self-centered, would translate into his next film as well. The final battle that took at least half an hour of screen time, is the Avengers comic book come alive in larger than life spectacle that's best seen in the IMAX 3D format.So what's next? Iron Man 3 will blast off and be first off the blocks, then there should be another Captain America film that will showcase more of SHIELD. I guess maybe either Thor or Hulk may make a big screen return next, before getting everyone together again for another hurrah, hinted upon midway through the end credits, but which was mentioned would be a smaller film than this one. Let's wait and see, but in the meantime, get out there and enjoy this one heck of a ride! Definitely a film that fans of either hero will find irresistibly awesome and in a league of its own. More please!","

"The Avengers","Troy_Campbell","26 April 2012","Four years ago Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury appeared in Iron Man's end credit scene and whipped the comic book geek-world into a frenzy; it was a hint at larger things to come within the Marvel universe and the fans knew it. Since then we've witnessed a franchise (including The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America) that has excelled in self-referential plugs, character cameos and plot crossovers, all building a giddy excitement towards the main show: The Avengers. It was worth the wait.Writer-director Joss Whedon has concocted a perfect blend of mouth-watering action, laugh-out-loud humour and eye-blistering CGI. Whether it's the excellent Thor vs Iron Man vs Captain America rumble in the forest, the mind-boggingly spectacular 30 minute finale in downtown Manhattan, or any scene with the Hulk, the bruising action is choreographed and executed with a flair not seen in any of the aforementioned standalone movies and, along with the series' best CGI, is likely to have your jaw on the ground. Similarly, the script and dialogue is crafted with such a high level of intelligence and wittiness that every joke hits the mark – the Hulk's reaction to Loki belittling him had me in tears – and the story roars along at a cracking pace, allowing you to glide over the minor gaps in plot. However, perhaps Whedon's most amazing feat is how he balances the screen time among the mammoth cast (who continue their great work from the franchise's previous instalments); he has kept every character in focus, yet never over-shadowing the others, resulting in an ensemble piece that clicks from the get go. The opening act may be a tad slow, but this superhero adventure is a rollicking good ride with genuine awe-inspiring moments. Bring on the sequel.","

The film brings together some of the biggest and most iconic characters in the Marvel universe, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk, and pits them against the powerful villain Loki and his army of aliens.One of the things that makes The Avengers such a great film is the incredible cast. Robert Downey Jr. Once again delivers a fantastic performance as Iron Man, bringing the character's wit and sarcasm to life. Chris Evans also shines as Captain America, perfectly capturing the character's sense of duty and integrity.

The pacing is also spot-on, with the film never feeling too slow or too fast. And the special effects are absolutely breathtaking, with the battle scenes in particular being absolutely stunning.Overall, The Avengers is a film that is not to be missed. It is a perfect blend of action, humor, and drama, and it is one of the best superhero films ever made. I give it a 10/10, and I highly recommend it to any fans of the Marvel universe or anyone who just loves a great action film.","

The movie did an amazing job at uniting these characters and the team. Especially since the individual films all had their own style and feel. I love how they keep everyone one to their truest form. The story flows perfectly and feels right. The cast is like a well fit puzzle, they all glow, no one gets shoved aside and no one stands out more than the other, they're all great. The comedy was top-notch, I loved the mixture of action, heart and funny scenes, the movie was perfectly balanced. And above all they finally did the hulk justice. Mark Ruffalo is the hulk. He's perfect for it. They wrote his script so cleverly and the hulk himself is just down right cool. For the first time we really get to see SHIELD in its full glory. When watching all the Marvel MCU movies/series in chronological order, this one really makes sense and stands out beautifully.","

"The Avengers","ketgup83","27 April 2012","Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first teaser. I was waiting for this movie from the time they announced it and my joy knew no bounds when I saw the movie tonight. In one word – Superb. I don't mind watching it once again. S.H.I.E.L.D director, Nick Fury is threatened by Loki and his armed forces. Loki is sinister brother of Thor who was dethroned from Kingdom of Asgard for his misdeeds. He plans an attack on Earth by opening a portal through which his army can arrive into the Earth from Asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into Loki's slave. In order to protect Earth from destruction, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by Ironman , Captain America , Thor and Hulk along with Black Widow and HawkEye. Together , they must fight the evil Loki before he captures the people of earth and turns them into his slave It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. The movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers steam and makes it more entertaining. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of Hulk , the fight between Thor and Ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Robert Downey Jr. clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. His puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as Bruce Banner and his change of expression as The Hulk. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well.

Mark Ruffalo turned in a good performance as David Banner. Samuel Jackson is usual Bad-ass self. Did I leave anyone out? The CGI is up to today's usual high standard. Oh I nearly forgot: The Thor guy was pretty cool too, though why does a Scandinavian God speak with a British Accent?The bad: There's no plot. Loki is a 1-dimensional villain. He ""wants to be king."" He wants people to submit. That's it. That's all there is.I expected more from Joss Whedon, like the incredible reboot J. J. Abrams was able to deliver Star Trek. Damn it! I don't really care much for Star Trek, but Abrams had me nearly crying at the start of that movie.Instead with Avengers we get another paint-by-numbers Superhero movie. You *can* make a Superhero movie with Heart! Look at the original Superman, or more recently Dark Knight and even Kick Ass. I want action and plenty of it, but I also want to connect with the characters on screen.The problem with Avengers is that connection isn't there and there's not a lot happening either. The production values are high, but that's no substitute for a plot. Until the CGI battle at the end, I was a kind of bored.","

Hopefully nobody will confuse the title with that crap handed John Steed Emma Peel 1998 film that everyone wanted nothing to do with. Perhaps a title change? We have a host of superheros including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. The villain is Loki of the Thor film and he has a world domination scheme that is every bit as corny as any other world domination scheme. That doesn't matter because viewers will attend to see the combination of powers become a reality. Loki is a great villain and thankfully he is targeted by all of these heroes thus giving us great action sequences. His run-in with the Hulk is especially amusing. Joss Whedon is the right director to bring this spectacular together and the special effects created are explosive. Whedon also gives each cast member a good fair share of time. We have Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark / Iron Man whose sarcasm is a scene stealer. Chris Evans is thawed and ready as Captain America. Chris Hemsworth as Thor sets to bring Loki back to his planet for justice. Mark Ruffalo is terrific filling in as the Hulk whose anger is subdued until fans are given the payoff in full blown green fury. Scarlett Johansson oozes sexiness as Black Widow, a skilled spy trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. Third act descends to action combination of the various talented ensemble that is a thrill. Score: 9 / 10","

Chief among the movie's strengths is that everyone who headlined their own movies gets some time in the sun, and that's . . . well, that's just impressive. And despite the dull NYC ""big finale"", there was some exciting Summer spectacle herein (mostly in the fight scenes). But my favorite parts were during the quieter moments, when all the noise and CGI were dialed down. The movie works best when it's a bunch of competing heroes thrown together in a room. When the egos and styles clash, Whedon's rhythms and sense of humor blossom.But it does its job admirably, and lends itself to serious popcorn-munching.7/10","

Anyone who is a comic reader or a Marvel universe fan will notice lots of fine details on the characters, the plot and the images. Even with the daunting challenge of presenting The Avengers as an entertaining all-star gathering, director Joss Whedon cleverly told the story while utilizing the fine talents of the stars.

"The Avengers","changmoh","24 April 2012","This is one of the most awaited movies of all time - and for the legions of fans in Asia, the wait is going to be over soon. For those who have not yet booked their tickets, I suggest that they do so, preferably at the IMAX cineplex where the action in 3D can be overwhelming.I must say I was a bit skeptical that writer-director Joss Whedon (creator of TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"") can pull off this six-in-one superhero flick. Will it be like assembling six major egos in a small room - and cramming their style? With the plot of 'six against one (Loki)', wouldn't that be overkill and unfair advantage? Will the storyline/plot measure up to the CGI and effects that take up a major part of its US$220 million budget? Will this Disney effort follow in the heels of John Carter and go downhill? All these doubts are dashed after 20 minutes into the movie - when we find Earth being threatened by demi-god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D (for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) starts The Avenger Initiative. From here on, it is pure, Marvelous fanboy entertainment of the supreme order! You can bet this one is going to put Whedon among the ranks of top directors like Spielberg and Cameron.Those who have seen Captain America last year may remember the Tesseract, the all-powerful energy cube found at the bottom of the ocean. Loki, the megalomaniacal brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) manages to get his hands on it and plans to use it to summon his army of outer space warriors to take over the world.To stop him, Fury and his assistant Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) assemble the various 'superheroes' on his massive 'helicarrier' in preparation for war against Loki's forces. These include Steve Rogers' Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark's Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor. Special agent Clint Barton, or Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) makes up the sixth member a bit later when Manhattan is being bombarded by outer space monsters.The climactic battle takes up almost all of the final half-hour but the whole movie is absorbing enough, thanks to a cleverly written script that incorporates a fine balance of sincerity and self-effacing wit. Indeed, before the Avengers battle the alien invaders, they fight one another, both physically and verbally. Like, Iron Man's quips when he first meets Thor: ""What's this, Shakespeare in the park?"" and ""Does your mother know you're wearing her drapes?"" Indeed, the punchlines are more powerful - and memorable - than the real punches.Whedon does not waste time re-introducing his characters. We are already familiar with Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. The physical talents of Scar-Jo's Black Widow are 'introduced' in an interrogation scene where she later beats the brains out of her interrogators while she puts her boss Agent Coulson on hold.I have always wondered how Mark Ruffalo will fare as the Hulk - and I am surprised he almost ran away with the show. His Dr Banner is a mellow guy hiding out in India before being 'persuaded' by Natasha to join The Avengers. On board Fury's helicarrier, we can see him doing his utmost to keep his temper in check - ""you must have been doing a lot of yoga"" someone jokes. And yes, when The Hulk emerges, it is really Incredible. Also watch out for Marvel Comics' Stan Lee who gets a self-effacing one-liner during the action scenes.One of the 'misses' of this film is that Natalie Portman's Jane is left out of Thor's story - except for a picture. This is in contrast to Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) which takes up quite a few scenes. And even though he has to face-off against six superheroes, Hiddleston's Loki is formidable and menacing enough as the arch villain. Of course, Jackson finally has a proper role here after cameos in the previous Iron Man and Captain America films.It really isn't about whether you're going to catch ""The Avengers""; it's how many times you will want to see it.","

"The Avengers","XweAponX","24 August 2012","As I missed this in the Theatre, I waited a long time for the Blu-Ray to come out. I knew back in 2008 when Iron Man came out, that The Avengers were Assembling.I did not understand why Marvel made a second ""Hulk"" film after Ang lee's marvel-ous work, but that Hulk was a stand-alone story, and not worked into the fabric of the Marvel Multiverse.Each solo Avengers film introduced characters which were to be in this film, Iron Man was the most developed of them all, The Hulk, Captain America and Thor each developed those characters for this film.There was one more Avenger that should have been included, Wolverine, but at the time Marvel did not have the rights. Even so, Wolverine was not part of that first Avengers comic so long ago where they Battle Loki, and that is what this film was about.Joss Whedon was the prefect director to tackle this: His work on his Television shows and the Movie ""Serenity"" prepared him for it. I was glad that an Underdog was given the Helm, and he succeeded brilliantly.After being Bombarded by the first Three X-Men films and the Sam Raimi Spidey Trilogy, it was just time to make this film. The Avengers are that one Marvel Property that has threads into all of Marvel's Super Heroes.The pivotal piece was Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury - I grew up when Nick Fury was a white guy and he was a much different character. Sometime in the late 90's and early 2000's Marvel recreated all of their Heroes and gave some of them a complete Makeover: But Jackson plays Fury much the same way David Hasselhoff did in the TV Movie. It does not matter what colour he is, white or black, he's the same guy.It is this one man who spearheads ""The Avengers Initiative"" - Even though his board of supervisors have put the program ""on ice"" Fury finds a way to make it happen, he puts together a ""response team"" to deal with the threat of Loki.We met Loki in ""Thor"" - Originally he was Thor's ""Brother"" and best friend. In ""Thor"" Loki learns he is actually a Frost Giant (Which is actually part of the Norse Legend) and something snaps in him. The Loki in The Avengers is not the subdued, Quiet Loki we meet in the first few scenes of Thor, he has completely lost it.This Mirrors the way he was written for the Comic Books, the way I see it, Loki does not really know what he wants, so he is just trying as many bad things as he can think up. In the case of this film, he has made a shaky alliance with some creepo Aliens (We learn exactly who these guys are, at the very end of the film, after the title credits), as ""The Other"" is talking to his boss, who turns in Profile and he is a SKRULL).The Tesseract, the ""Cosmic Cube"" which has been a huge part of Marvel stories, was seen in Captain America, Red Skull was abusing it, it fell into the arctic ice and Howard Stark grabbed it. After the events of the Movie Thor, Fury assigns Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) to figure out what the futz this thing actually is.And they find out, as ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) states at the beginning of the film, The Cube is a doorway, and it is being opened from the other side.In steps Loki and he has gone even more insane, comparing the Human Race to bugs to be squashed via a Boot. Loki manages to turn Hawkeye and Selvig (This is another thing about Loki which came from the Comics), and the entire complex where The Cube was being tested caves in, huge Radar antenna and all.From this point on, it's Non Stop. We get to see SO much stuff from the Comics, the SHIELD HeliCarrier, the Avengers Mansion (Which was Stark Tower). But the best thing was the interaction of these guys, they don't get along in the Comics, and they don't get along very well at first here. What surprised me was how well Mark Ruffalo made The Hulk come to life, even though I liked Ang Lee's Hulk better: But Rufallo actually ""Acted"" The Hulk, which was something not done in the two Hulk Movies.From this point on, Avengers sets a Bar for Marvel Movies that will be difficult to reach again, let alone surpass.This film easily surpasses the quality of the first two X-Men films, without burying them.","

"The Avengers","Fields201","7 May 2012","So much build up and it all leads to this: And it's awesome! I know I'm late in reviewing this and everything has been said in all kinds of praise and this movie deserves it. Just see it. Even if you don't like comic book movies: See it. What I find amusing is that Ironman was never really the top billing of The Avengers. It was always Captain America... until now. Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene that his name is first on the credits. Seriously, he's that awesome. I was also surprised with Mark Ruffalo's performance as The Hulk. He was great! His scenes with Robert Downey Jr. are some of the most memorable. I also haven't seen the Thor flick but the guy who played them was really good and really seemed into character. Hawkeye was cool and Scarlett Johanssen is hot. Okay, the plot? Bad guy named Loki wants to take over the world and does a really good General Zod impression (Kneel before me!) and Avengers try to stop him. What's funny is that he looks tough in the beginning but then turns into a rag doll at the end. Just ask The Hulk. And whatever injustice the previous movies had done to The Hulk certainly makes up for it here.Just see it! It's a lot of fun and it's what summer movies are supposed to be. It's a great beginning to summer movies. I'm glad I went!","

"The Avengers","Eightiesjunkie","19 January 2013","I know a lot of critics and fans loved this movie, but unfortunately, this movie just didn't do anything for me. My first biggest problem with this movie: Mark Ruffalo was HORRIBLE as Bruce Banner! It was like he was sleepwalking through the entire movie! Marvel fired Edward Norton, and the best replacement they could find was this guy? Did they just pick his name out of a hat? Come on! My second biggest problem with this movie: Captain America gets pushed to the side, and most of the focus is on Iron Man. Why?! Here's a crazy idea: Seeing as how Captain America is the LEADER of the Avengers! Why not give him the spotlight? Furthermore, Iron Man and Captain America hardly ever get along in this movie. This wasn't at ALL like it was in the comics! In the comics, Tony Stark deeply admired and respected Steve Rogers. In Fact, Tony Stark's father, Howard helped create the ""Captain America"" program. My third biggest problem with this movie: It takes FOREVER for the The Avengers to come together and work as a team. Throughout the movie, all they do is fight most of the time, and occasionally throw in a corny joke. Can someone please tell me what purpose that serves, other than to look cool? If you like generic, run of the mill, superhero movies, then give this a watch. However, don't expect this movie to be deep and meaningful, because you will be sorely disappointed.","

"The Avengers","anthonypape","2 June 2013","I missed this movie when it came out at the cinema because, from what I could see from the trailers and elsewhere, it looked a bit 'silly' for want of a better word, kid's stuff perhaps. We've come to expect much more from comic book interpretations. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Iron Man series, Spiderman and Batman reboots. Where I draw the line I think, is with characters such as Thor and Captain America and to a lesser extent the Hulk - characters who haven't dated too well at all and should have been left in their respective times. They just look so out of place sitting along side the more believable and 'cooler' looking characters like Iron man in present day settings. But anyhow, having seen the high ratings the movie was getting (including on here) I thought 'maybe it cant be so bad after all?' and gave it a look. Sadly my initial instinct was right - this film is well made, has great CGI and acting, but.. its entirely spoilt by the inclusion of silly outdated characters with dubious special powers and a guy who turns into a CGI cartoon green man/monster. I realise that it wouldn't be as much of an assemble without these characters and to substitute spiderman or other superheroes might well upset some purists, but might have made for a better film. Thor in particular is from a bygone era of comic books and should have been left there.","

"The Avengers","kaden_lewis","14 June 2021","The best movie of phase 1! This movie was literally perfect. It had a great plot, a great story, great acting, and one of the best villains in the MCU. I thought the way they tied in parts or Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger through the Tesseract was cool. I also liked how the movie centered around Loki and his quest to rule Midgard (Earth), by stealing the Tesseract from a S. H. I. E. L. D base, taking command of Hawkeye, Selvig and Shield agents, and him teaming up with the Chitauri to attack New York and eventually the world. The story and dialogue was even good, I liked how the Avengers would always bicker together, and I also liked the punny jokes. I also loved the fact that the soul reason The Avengers decided to work together was due to the death of Coulson. Like always, the acting by everyone was great, even the new additions. Lastly, Tom Hiddleston as Loki was absolutely amazing. He played the role to perfection again. He is always great and I really hope to see a lot more of him in the future.Like I said, this was the best movie of Phase 1, I recommend this to anyone, even people who haven't seen any MCU movies before.","

"The Avengers","Red_Identity","11 June 2012","I had never been heavily anticipating The Avengers. I'm not a huge fan of any of these superheroes, and haven't been up to date on most of these. I only saw the first Iron Man and the two Hulk films, but honestly nothing Marvel released since then. The Avengers surprised me. It turned out to be a fairly slow-paced film with subtle character dynamics and nuanced performances. Okay, really, it's just a BLAST! Nothing more has to be said. It has a tone that giddily encourages you to get on board. It's pretty much everything you expect, but it doesn't insult your intelligence. In fact, the characters and dialogue are all pretty well-written. A film like this could have had just as amazing action sequences, but with lesser writing and development, wouldn't be nearly as satisfying. Truly, there's something to enjoy in all of these characters, particularly Banner (perfectly portrayed by Ruffalo) and the always charming Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Having not seen Thor, I enjoyed him a lot too and thought Hemsworth was pretty excellent. Technially, it's excellent. The editing is fantastic, and there is not a single flaw within the editing achievement. Editing action films, especially in their big moments, can be very hard to accomplish, but these filmmakers did an impeccable job. The action sequences are amazing, and big, huge. Overall, there's so much excitement to be had here. I don't have a problem calling The Avengers THE ""perfect summer blockbuster"". It truly is, and boy what a ride it is. Strongly recommended to everyone.","

"The Avengers","chancey-23","14 July 2012","The Avengers is truly a film that should be considered an instant classic. Joss Whedon does more than do justice to getting four superheroes on the screen, but he makes a tremendous yarn to go with it. Yes, the greatest strength of the film is the screenplay. The one liners are a keeper, and it comes with some great performances as well, particularly with Robert Downey, Jr and Mark Ruffalo. The film entertains in action, succeeds in comedy, and manages to be one of the greatest films we're bound to see this summer, and potentially one of the best films we'll see of the year. And an end note, if you do a sequel, please keep Joss Whedon. Without him, expect The Avengers 2 to be less entertaining overall.","

"The Avengers","batleh","27 May 2012","As someone who has not read Marvel comics, has not seen the films ""Captain America,"" ""The Hulk,"" ""Thor,"" or ""Iron Man II,"" this film failed to pull me in. As a standalone movie, ""The Avengers"" feels like a mishmash of rapid surface-level character introduction and way too much action. Little attention is given to character development, as it seems viewers are expected to come into the film with a degree of knowledge. However, this is not to say that I think the film would be great if I did have some knowledge of the backstory. There's little in the way of a moral here or a deeper meaning, as this is just a good-GUY-saves-world plot. It's one that (like many superhero movies before) makes me ask if character development or THOUGHT, for that matter, really are being extinguished by money-driven action. I wouldn't even call this a ""popcorn movie,"" as I found few laughs and absolutely no connection to the characters in my experience. I like action movies, but I need to be drawn in to the characters in order to CARE about the action. ""The Avengers"" didn't even try to draw me in, it just said ""here are the heroes, now watch them fight!"" If the first hour had established some human element for the heroes, I might have liked the action. As it stands, the audience is thrown into the arena with the invincible combatants, and expected to immediately feel for them despite their inherent invincibility. I must ask - why should I care about action when one side can't lose and I haven't been told otherwise? Why should I root for the Yankees? (The only reason I can see is because the ""bad guy"" Loki wears a ridiculous looking costume). I keep attempting to find redemption in society's reception of this movie. Maybe that's why I hope that I'm just missing a big part of the backstory. I'm a big Whedon fan, and came into ""The Avengers"" hoping to see some more of his magic. I was rewarded with a two-and-a-half hour snooze fest of CG action. My only sincere hope is that the millions he makes off of this movie funds ""real"" projects of his in the future.","

"The Avengers","MLDinTN","25 March 2013","I was fully expecting to not like this movie because I haven't thought much of Iron Man or Captain America movies, but the story behind this film was better than I expected. Also, you need to have seen previous superhero movies to get this movie, especially Thor. Loki, Thor's evil brother, comes to earth to lead an alien invasion and it's up to the superheros to stop him. The Black Widow and Hawkeye have very little to do and could have been left out. So basically, the heroes are chasing Loki around until the invasion when there is a huge battle at the end. The battle was cool with cool computer effects. This is when the Hulk gets to play his big part. But the main heroes in the film were Thor and Ironman, and Captain America gets to make a few decisions too.FINAL VERDICT: OK action flick, but you need to know about the previous superhero movies to get this one.","

"The Avengers","Floated2","10 December 2013","The Avengers was very well waited among Marvel comic book fans and general superhero fans. When it comes to delving deeply into the minds or motivations of the film's other, previously established heroes, he abstains all together. And maybe that's for the best. Even with 2 hours and 24 minutes to kill, there's precious little time for him to offer remedial courses in Marvel mythology. Those who haven't done their homework and watched the previous films still should be able to follow the basics, but they almost certainly will be left scratching their heads from time to time. In the mix among stars doing battle are Scarlett Johansson, who plays the Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as archery expert Hawkeye. There were a lot of high expectations for this film and on many levels it delivers, while on few others it disappoints. Since writer-director Joss Whedon was dealing with so many big-name stars, like Robert Downey Jr., who reprises his role as Iron Man, Gwenyth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Mark Ruffalo, who takes over the role of Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk, there's just not enough screen time to fit everyone adequately in.For those who have kept up with it, though, The Avengers is a nice payoff to a sprawling and ambitious filmmaking strategy, and one whose blueprint can be counted on to change the way major studios approach their superhero franchises for years to come.
==========
As a rewatch 05/01/18' and nearly 5 years since initial watch 12/10/13' opinions remain near same. The Avengers has great entertainment value, though at the same time some of it feels quite bland and uninteresting. The finale battle elevates the film as a whole but much forgettable scenes I had forgotten.","

"The Avengers","morefshpls","16 May 2012","How I would love to have championed Joss Whedon for this. But alas, no.The Avengers is not a great movie. Avengers is a boring movie.OK, I saw it in 3D. The only other film I've seen in 3D was Avatar and - this may also indicate to you I'm not a movie snoot - I rather thought Avatar was OK, unlike many who say it's awful. You would be right therefore, to infer that the novelty of 3D hasn't exactly had a chance to wear thin on me yet.Let's just get the 3D out of the way: for me, it was like watching a holographic projection, very unreal. Often there were only 2, maybe just 3 planes of focus and sometimes this made the focus too oddly focused!, e.g. a wobbling briefcase in the foreground that looked like something out of Toy Story. Also, some of the action with Johanssen is frantic CGI cartoony acrobatics, and in 3D this just looks even more of a mess, anything but exciting! I was cautioned not to see in 3D - that person was right. The print isn't compensated for by the darkening effect of the glasses. I think it affected me too. Eye-fatigue, plus the combination of how those glasses make the film so dark, plus a major major flaw in the film, caused me to give up on consciousness and spare my eyeballs more than once.Yes, in 3D at least, this film is too dark to see what's going on. Detail becomes elusive and the 3D focus only allows you to see one or two parts of the screen - everything else is often deliberately way out-of-focus. This makes the film visually uninteresting (especially for us 'autistic' background viewers ;-).And the major major flaw.. Oh, I might have already let that slip: this movie is boring! Surely I can't be so bored that easily by a film I've never seen before! It's impossible! Avengers: yes, there's some showy effects that may impress those that can get off on over 2 hours of blam blam blam but me: yaaaawwn! Honestly, I was expecting to enjoy The Avengers, especially since I kinda liked the Thor movie (nothing to do with Portman, who does very little for me). And also, my total non-appreciation for The Avengers goes against what I'd hoped... that I could say something great about this film, and be able to champion Joss Whedon for a new era of Sci-Fi movies. Serenity was good, very good - albeit with forgivably TV-movie quality. Unfortunately, it seems, budget wasn't the limiting factor and I've now lost interest.Duncan Jones, do you hear?","

"The Avengers","joker-4","11 May 2012","If you have been a fan of the core Marvel Studios' films since 2008's IRON MAN, where the beginnings of the ""Avengers Initiative"" were first teased and carried through into the 2010 sequel as well as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER, then the AVENGERS will not disappoint. In fact, it very well might make you question why the other franchise films weren't as good as this fast- paced, funny, superhero showdown.Marvel has been very focused and dedicated with the development of its properties under the Disney banner – and they no doubt wish that the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises could return to their fold, as it was the success of these earlier films that brought Marvel Comics out of bankruptcy – and has been providing solid entertainment from its creators and stars alike; by Odin's beard, Sir Kenneth Branagh directed THOR. Enter Joss Whedon, who created a weekly TV show in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER that was a near-perfect example of a live-action comic book, to deliver a heavily-anticipated yet so-easy-to-fail production of getting such a diverse character set in a movie that worked. And worked it did.The film gets off to a slow and even somewhat murky start as Loki, Thor's mischievous half-brother, played with a Anthony Hopkins-worthy sneer by Tom Hiddleston, appears, escapes from and is responsible for the destruction of a SHIELD HQ as well as the spiriting away of a few supporting characters including Stellan Skarsgard's Dr. Selvig, also of THOR, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, getting the full movie treatment here, all under the semi-impotent glare of Samuel L. Jackson's one-eyed spy Nick Fury. Obiously Loki never saw Samuel L's wallet from another film.The movie picks up with the re-introduction of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow as Whedon has some fun showing what moves he could have presented in BUFFY if he had an Avengers-sized budget backing him up, but it truly gets bright when the three protagonists, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, finally appear and, of course, get into a wrestling match to prove who has the biggest repulsor/shield/hammer. Once the team finally assembles, insanity, and the hilarity that often follows, ensues. Oh, and Mark Ruffalo proves that the Hulk can indeed smash.Joss Whedon's adept skills, he also writes the screenplay, prove to be the other superhero powerhouse as he successfully created a production that pleases the hardcore fanboy who is aware of Thanos, the mainstream movie audience who thinks that Tony and Pepper are destined for each other, and his own loyal, core fan base of Browncoats. Each hero gets their own time to shine in situations worthy of a comicbook splash page. The rough-up dust-up of a third act that entirely deals with the assembled team involved in a street-level brawl in NYC against, what else, an invading alien army, could very well have became tedious, as admittedly, the obligatory interstellar menace is faceless, forgettable and seemingly invented for the sales of action figures, but the action, humor and allure of these powerful heroes is truly something unique and that magic is perfectly captured on the screen.2008 saw the release of both IRON MAN and Warner Bros.' DARK KNIGHT. The result was that both films set the bar that future genre films would have to follow. In 2012 that bar was set yet again. What remains to be seen is if the upcoming DARK KNIGHT RISES film, as well as the sequels for IRON MAN, THOR and CAPTAIN America, will continue to raise that bar, or if they will all just... assemble.","

Does anyone care anymore that so little effort and imagination goes into film making? Avengers is 95% CGI, with a plot that is staggering in it's stupidity and unoriginality. Two of the so-called 'super-heroes' have no 'super' qualities at all - unless having funny coloured eyes and firing souped-up arrows or running around in a tight spandex suit showing lots of cleavage and pouting a lot qualify as super powers. All Black Widow does is what Emma Peel did 45 years ago - and half as well, i.e. kick ass. Even worse, the two best and most interesting Marvel characters, Iron Man and Hulk are reduced to mindless morons smashing their way through the enemy and without any attempt at the characterization that previous films did at least endeavour to give them. Every scene and plot twist is utterly predictable, the special effects are boring and the only thing to admire is Samuel L. Jackson'e uncanny ability to find high grossing movie trash to take a stroll through, without making the least effort, and pick up a fat cheque at the other end. Now THAT IS a super power.","

"The Avengers","anselmdaniel","27 January 2023","This review contains spoilers.The Avengers is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2012. The movie is directed by Joss Whedon, produced by Kevin Feige, screenplay by Joss Whedon. The story is written by Zak Penn, and Joss Whedon. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Hiddleston. Loki launches an invasion of Earth leading the heroes of the Earth to band together and stop the invasion.The Avengers is a great action movie. The movie incorporates the grand visuals found in the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and combines them for one spectacle featuring the heroes that we know and love. The movie focuses on the spectacle rather than having a complex narrative focusing on specific characters. In this way it is more of a large set piece with pre-existing characters rather than a full narrative movie. The spectacle is impressive to watch with the ending battle in New York City being the highlight. The scenes leading up to that moment are impressive as the heroes band and fight amongst each other. The movie is about the heroes as a whole rather than individuals.The Avengers has great chemistry with its leads. Not only does the audience see visually impressive action but also the dynamic between the superheroes. The movie relishes in the heroes it has on display and it is a treat to watch for comic book fans. Audiences can see the heroes have their quarrel and what happens when Thor's hammer hits Captain America's shield. The story concerns the heroes and it is believable that Nick Fury's Avengers squad would not get along at first. It makes for an interesting story as the squad eventually overcomes their differences and begins to work together. This is a classic trope that is applied to a superhero story.The flaw of this movie is that Loki has not been built up as a massive villain before. Loki always seemed more like a joker and a specific villain for Thor rather than a large scale villain that spanned into Iron Man and Captain America's stories. I still enjoyed Tom Hiddleston's performance and watching him on the screen is sure to delight.I would recommend ""The Avengers"" directed by Joss Whedon.Grade: B.","

Without the need to introduce the main characters, the movie ditched the typical structure and started with a bang to never slow down, really. With action from the start, connecting every single character already presented (the six heroes, their recruiter, the villain). The movie assumed we all knew the characters because we saw the other movies (making them literally a ""must watch"" to savior all the details and enhance the experience), which was the best decision ever. They didn't follow the rules (they created their own, which will be become stalled later) and made the best possible ensemble movie.But it wasn't just pure action, because with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, they started (and would continue in the next movies) their philosophical (lightly philosophical, but still) exploration of war against an exterior threat. And they still managed to give the others moments to shine (if not really arcs of their own). Thor and Hulk with their powers; Black Widow's smart spy mind; Fury's uniting the team, etc.The action is insane and the CGI ridiculously perfect. Loki is perfect for a first villain and the dialogue is funny with the needed exposition done well.Having said all that, the second act could be better and parts a bit too childish or just stupid (Loki vs. Hulk; Hulk ""I'm always angry""; Hulk vs. Thor). But ultra minor things. Amazing movie.","

"The Avengers","briancham1994","5 August 2020","This was a very widely anticipated film and it had a big impact as well. Yet it did not leave much of an impression on me. The only thing I'll give it credit for is balancing all of the cast quite well. It features a lot of main characters and juggles their screentime quite effectively. However, the story itself is quite forgettable and devolves into a generic CGI battle against a generic alien army with a generic sky beam posing as the ultimate threat.","

"The Avengers","lilantman10","10 December 2012","Finally the Marvel Franchise reveals it's coup de grace and it's everything that we hoped for. Before I totally kiss this movie's butt for a while I'm going to delve into the negatives first.Just a warning the first 25 minutes are a little slow, which is to be expected when telling such a large story. Lord of the Rings needed a whole movie to build up to the adventure to put it into context. Some of Loki's dialogue is a little hard to understand at times because of the Norse language dialect, but that's easily fixed with second viewings. Other than that and some nitpicks the movie delivers.This is the movie we all made playing with our toys as a kid. Wheedon has done a fantastic job and I really don't think this movie could've worked as well without him. All the characters fit in this movie. I never thought a conversation between Loki and Nick Fury would work on screen but it does. Every character gets to shine in this movie. At time it's a Black Widow movie, then an Ironman movie, then a Thor movie, then a Captain America movie it all just fits perfectly. This movie has the best editing I've seen all year and some of the best acting to go with it. This movie is a culmination of several geek movies in one. It's got the ear turning and self reflection of Scott Pilgrim with the ensemble aspect of Star Trek (2009) with great dialogue. I'm going to say character a lot because that's the focus. The story is a little weak because it comes second to the characters. I've always described superhero movies are character pieces with big budgets. A lot of people complained that it's a comedy or that it's just a loud mindless movie with explosions like Transformers. Since when does having great humor make something a comedy? All the humor is in the witty dialogue and a few physical gags which are hilarious and also unique to the characters. And Wheedon adds lots of little subtle setups to the ending to make the movie more cohesive and smarter than it is. It's not a bad story it's just a simple character driven one. The only superhero movie I know that has more emphasis on story is The Dark Knight, but this blows that out of the water. 6 heroes are better than one. That's why Lord of The Rings, Star Trek, and Toy Story are so great. The Team or The Ensemble. There are so many ways this movie could've been ruined. Maybe they got the writing right, and the action is choreographed well but is filmed with shaky cam or is incoherent. All the action scenes in this movie are great and easy on the eyes and even have lots of character in them. The best scene in this movie is when the avengers are all arguing in a room. And the acting is the greatest. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. This movie is so much fun and if you don't like it it's probably because you didn't want to so anybody with an open mind should love this 10 out of 10","

"The Avengers","puzgolac","10 May 2012","Deceived by the praise and high ratings this movie received here I decided to watch it, even though I didn't like Thor, couldn't sit through the propaganda that was Captain America, and thought that both of the Ironmen were only average. The movie is just fighting, explosions, destruction to infinity, and the action isn't anything that you haven't seen before. There is just more of it, which doesn't make it better - it just makes it become boring and repetitive really fast. Scattered amongst those are retarded dialogs and stupid one-liners, seasoned with terrible acting and corny motivational speeches in the vein of ""God bless America, and make the rest of the world (or rather Universe) its colony."" Samuel L. Jackson was unbelievably terrible, Scarlett Johansson was terrible, and was that Sherlock Holmes wearing a suit of armor? I could have sworn that the character was the same, only the name was different. So much for Robert Downey's versatility. The rest of the cast followed suit. The only decent actor in this movie was Tom Hiddleston , but his character was ruined by the writers. Loki is supposed to be a god, but here he is so mediocre, that it is ridiculous. His ""mighty"" spear is nothing more than a very low grade laser gun, which doubles as a mind control tool that doesn't work all of the time, and when it does work, it does not work all that well. The mighty, fearsome aliens turn out to be mere cannon fodder, dropping like mosquitoes. Characters' level of strength and power changes throughout the movie to suit the need of the moment. There are 2 (yes, TWO) funny scenes, and both include the Hulk beating up people. That should give you an idea about the quality of the funny parts of the movie. I guess to like this one you would either have to be a die hard fan of the Avengers, or a die hard fan of mindless, repetitive, boring action. This movie doesn't require suspension of belief to be enjoyed. It requires suspension of brain functions.","

"The Avengers","jace_the_film_guy","16 July 2021","The Avengers film was meticulously crafted and well thought out. There was careful consideration taken in every element, every plotline and every piece of dialogue, which is can be positive but also negative. Because it was such a monumental cinematic moment, it seemed as though the filmmakers were doing everything possible to not mess it up and therefore did not take many risks. That being said, the film itself is fantastic. Seeing Earth's mightiest heroes fight side by side give you goosebumps, there are genuinely funny moments and the plot moves forward logically. However, compared to later films in the MCU, The Avengers just seems a little too safe.","

"The Avengers","asc85","26 May 2012","...this film wasn't good at all. With the exception of the excitement of seeing all these leading characters in one movie, I fail to see why everyone has been running and running to this movie. First of all, the acting is terrible, led by Chris Evans as a far-too-earnest Captain America, and Chris Hemsworth as a heavily accented Thor with dialogue that made sense hundreds of years ago, but not in 2012. Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, and Scarlett Johansson are decent enough, but no Academy Award nominees there. The plot and many of the sub-plots were difficult to follow, as the primary purpose of this movie was to show cars, buildings, and people being blown up. I understand that I'm not in this movie's target demographic, but the X-Men series and Iron Man were far more intelligent and interesting than this. Yes, I know this will be one of the highest grossing pictures of all-time, which is why I wanted to know what all the fuss was. Yes, I know there will be many sequels generated from this, which makes sense. Just count me out from going to see them.","

I had seen enough and did not stay in the hall to watch the film from the start.I can't understand why this film got a 8.6 note. Perhaps everyone who participated logged in and gave it 10?

"The Avengers","walentys","29 August 2018","The only way this film can be enjoyed is to toss away all expectations of what makes up good cinema and instead go in expecting some cool action, hot chicks and a few wisecracks.In this endeavor it succeeds fairly well; it is in fact almost nonstop action, and it flows well for this purpose. There's hardly a moment of relative boredom or dullness, and it keeps your attention throughout. Pacing is something many films have trouble with and this does it well.The special effects and sound editing were very well-done too. Not once did I think they were overdone or cheesy-looking/-sounding, and they packed a punch. The way the aliens looked was neat, and most of the fighting was cool to watch. What sticks out in my memory is Thor hitting his hammer against Captain America's shield, an awesomely done scene for effects.The humorous one-liners, mostly stemming from Tony Stark but also from the camaraderie among the Avengers group, also work well enough and keep you at least smiling throughout.However, I sensed a strong amount of cold, calculated filmmaking here. I felt almost no style in this entire film, and instead I felt as if Joss Whedon had a quota to fill as he was filming it. It's almost as if he was thinking, ""I need to show what happens during the following encounters: Thor vs. Captain America, Thor vs. Iron Man, Iron Man vs. Loki"", etc., and then later on, many combinations of two or three of the Avengers fighting bad guys together, to contrast their earlier conflicts. I appreciate the contrast that went into that aspect, but it just felt plain robotic the way it was executed. The thought pattern I detected was, ""You damn well can't have an Avengers movie without this happening, and this, and..."" The result of this is that this ""quota"" took the focus and actually enticing filmmaking was put on the backburner. He was simply showing things happening with entirely no flair or style of direction whatsoever. Oh look, here's Iron Man coming in to save the day! He's going to say something funny, don't we know it! Nothing stylish, unexpected or cinematic happens in this entire film. It left a dry taste in my mouth, despite all the cool effects and fighting.The story, along with the direction, was very milquetoast and forgettable. To briefly summarize: Loki, an alien, comes down to Earth to wreak havoc; the Avengers team up and stop him and all the aliens he summons through a giant portal as well. You'd think Nick Fury, being the leader of the Avengers, would take on a more interesting storyline role, but he really doesn't. I was maniacally uninterested in every single scene with him talking to the heads of S.H.I.E.L.D., and beyond that his storyline doesn't really go many places in this film. In fact all the other individual character storylines didn't really go anywhere either, which is okay since this film was a group effort, but the overall group storyline was not very interesting either, basically another rendition of saving the planet. Therefore neither the overarching group storyline nor the individual storylines were very fulfilling, leaving the story as a whole lacking.The script was also extremely dry and poorly written. I feel this was another item that went on the backburner to give the aforementioned ""quota"" more focus. Most of the lines were very uninteresting and without character. One example that stuck out in my mind is Nick Fury saying, ""I'll bet you $10 you're wrong"". People may say this phrase in reality; it's not the realism about it I attack but the character and flair of it. This is a movie; when characters speak they should be saying things that are somewhat relevant, interesting, mysterious, gripping, funny, or any combination thereof. Something that delivers, something with edge or character. Most of the lines in the entire film I have completely forgotten already except ones like the above that I remembered just to point out how uninteresting they are. Just like with the direction, I felt as if the script, too, just had people saying things to move the story along. Very sparsely was any extra style or flair or character added in.Last but entirely not least is the acting, and overall I was disappointed. I'll start with the good: Robert Downey Jr. was his usual funny smartass self, and I have no complaints, nor was he exceptional. I also actually quite enjoyed Chris Evans as Captain America; I find him a talented actor who works well in various kinds of films. Also Scarlett Johansson did a great job as usual. I love Stellan Skarsgård; he's a great actor, but I have to admit his placement in the film felt awkward and every time he came on screen I chose to express it through hysterical laughter. Samuel L. Jackson did a decent job as Nick Fury but I wasn't very impressed, but I blame that on the script. Now for the bad: The main villain of the film, Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, was a terrible choice for the main villain of any film. I mostly laughed at his scenes, because of how bad his acting was, when laughter was unintended. The guy who plays Thor, Chris Hemsworth, was not very good either in this film. Also Mark Ruffalo was a disappointment to see. I don't mind his acting normally but it was just so noticeably inferior to Edward Norton's Hulk that it has to count as a negative.To sum up, good pacing, special effects and some interesting encounters between certain characters do not save a film when it has weak direction, a weak script, a weak storyline, mostly weak acting, and most glaring of all it seemed very cold, calculated, and without style. However, I was at least mildly entertained.","

"The Avengers","musback","27 August 2012","Where to start. Me and my wife watched this movie yesterday, to forget about the drama called 'battleship' (don't get me started.) But it's hard to choose the most retarded movie between the two. This one had some okay jokes in it, but like many people said: you don't feel any threat, you don't feel any story, you just see special effects and ""UHMERICA F* YAA"" 2hrs straight. The effects were good, and the Hulk smashed like he never smashed before, but every movie starts sucking as soon as you realize nobody of the good guys can actually die. (Lord Of the rings anyone?) and when legions of 10x more bad-ass alien monsters are killed throwing a chair at them or blind-aimed headshotting them with a bow on a spaceship going 300mph, you know you're just wasting your time. Anybody with the very least amount of self-respect, stay away from this movie, How this garbage achieved to get 8.6 on IMDb is more entertaining for me than watching that movie.

"The Avengers","alindsayal","12 December 2021","On my way to reviewing all the MCU films I have now made it to the end of the first phase which means I have made it to The Avengers and I re-watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of superheroes have to come together to save the world from an alien force.Main Character
He was the first star of the MCU and he is one of the main focuses here, I'm talking about Robert Downey Jnr as Tony Stark AKA Iron Man and I think he is great in the film. He has so much charisma and the one liners are coming at a really high rate in the film, the key thing for me though is that his character develops and I think what this film does really well is show you how much has changed in him since the first Iron Man film. Chris Evans is back as Captain America and it is fun seeing this man who is from another time having to deal with modern times, I also like how his character interacted with the others, also in the action scenes Cap still shines and this film doesn't even montage past all of it. The dynamic between Downey Jnr & Evans is great here and shows just how different their personalities are and how difficult it is for them to work together despite the world literally being on the line.Supporting Characters
Okay, there are so many characters so in order for this review to not be longer then it needs I will try and keep this as short as possible. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, he adds more humour and presence in the role and like all the other characters he really gets to excel by bouncing his presence off of the other characters. Tom Hiddleston plays the villain Loki and what a shock he is great too, we saw the start of the character in Thor but he has clearly progressed since then and I liked how the relationship between the two brothers develops from the previous film. Scarlett Johansson is back as Black Widow and she is much better here then she was in Iron Man 2, she is actually given a character and real time to shine and the best thing I can say is that she stands alongside these gods and super powered beings and doesn't look out of place. Jeremy Renner plays Hawkeye and they don't give him that much to do, or more like they handle the character poorly, but by the end of the film I came around to Renner in the role and given more to do he is a great fit for the character. Over the first phase of the MCU we have seen flickers of Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury but this is the most we get of him so far and he is great, he is just so cool and interesting with his motivations not being as black and white as you would expect for this film. Now onto The Hulk, Mark Ruffalo takes over the role in this film and he is great as Banner, yes it is different to Edward Norton but he feels like a natural fit and I really liked his character here. But The Hulk is the star of this film, when he gets going he is amazing and looks incredible, The Hulk has never been better then he is in this film I believe and credit has to go to him for that. Clark Gregg, Colbie Smulders & Stellan Skaarsgard are also all good in their roles.Story
As you can see by the lengthy cast list there is plenty going on here but it all balances nicely. I love the fact that the film shows that despite these characters all being heroes they don't all necessarily get along and have different views on things and it adds some much needed drama. I think the fact that we have seen their solo films aids in that as the film doesn't have to waste time with backstories and that allows the film to move at a really fast pace. Yes, there are some conveniences but I don't care, this film is so fun and the final act is comic book film greatness and delivers truly memorable moments.Script
The script is great, it just has that very snappy dialogue with plenty of one liners and dialogue that just fits the characters appropriately. There is also some depth and drama to this popcorn blockbuster film and that is good and credit to the people behind the script as this aids in making these god like characters interesting and a bit relatable.Style
The style of the film is one of the best things about the film. As I mentioned above, the pacing of the film is incredibly quick and that aids in making this an incredibly fun film. The action scenes are huge in scale and the CGI is at its best here then any MCU film that came before. Which brings me onto The Hulk, he looks amazing, the action scenes involving him are the the most exciting part of the film and finally the MCU had a Hulk that delivered in looking and fighting like he deserved.Overall
Overall, The Avengers is a special film that is a must watch for not just Marvel fans but all film fans. I think because of what The MCU now is we sometimes forget about this film and take it for granted. But without, The Avengers there wouldn't be an MCU and it is an amazing film that is honestly one of my favourite movies possibly ever.Rating - 10/10.","

"The Avengers","DareDevilKid","6 May 2012","Movie Review: The Avengers (2012) by DareDevilKid.DDKMy Rating: 8.5/10Yes! Oh, boy did this movie deliver! Its like all the cogs fitted perfectly in a well oiled mechanism. Director Joss Whedon has made a brilliant transition from the small to the big screen. The Director has delivered a classic Action/Adventure film of epic proportions. And this was no little achievement, considering all the legendary characters of folklore mostly possessing their individual blockbusters - some really good and some plain mediocre -, which were amalgamated into one huge vista.All the superheroes & even the super-villain merge into the plot beautifully and appear exactly at the opportune moments. Even a somewhat throwaway hero like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) feels vital. Her fight scenes are Buffy cool. Hemsworth and Evans are more relaxed, more comfortable in their spandex skin. If there's an underused super it's Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) but in the last act he impresses, too.But The true standout is The Hulk. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner pulls off the trick of allowing his inner rage to simmer just below the surface the whole time. And when the green dude shows up, stand back and just enjoy. He's the first version of Hulk to make his burst of power feel so gratifying. His destructive nature is infectious. Also an honorable mentions have to bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man & Chris Hemsworth's - he's really growing with each passing film - Thor, who adequately support Mark Ruffalo and his alter-ego throughout the movie.The Avengers looks great. The reportedly $250 million budget is on the screen. Many scenes have a great deal of variety. Not just well- choreographed action, there's a cleverness to the very idea to many of the scenes. Whedon pushes his heroes to their limits. When your script can put demigod Thor in peril that's incredible.The plot is simple yet effective - Thor's evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston - a slimy megalomaniac) has taken a cube called the Tesseract that harnesses limitless energy and aliens from another dimension intend to invade Earth to get it. Its easy to follow and merges well into the narration to let the film deliver what audiences really want to see - these ultimate superheroes becoming a team and kicking much butt.The action is magnanimous, the CGI effects are dazzling but ushered only when required, great and witty one-liners are interspersed intermittently, the humor is enthralling, the set-pieces are brilliant, each character is painstakingly developed, the narration is crisp and finally but most importantly, the action makes sense - a rarity for action adventure movies nowadays - in a way that you follow each minutest detail even while its bursting on screen at the rate of knots. The action occurs only after enough plot and character detailing and even when it occurs, it smoothly takes the plot forward. This rare feat elevates Whedon as the real superhero of this film.'The Avengers' reminds us of the reason we love movies ant buy tickets for admittance in a cinema hall. It will keep drawing you back for more, as viewing it just once is insulting and will leave you just plain unsatisfied. The euphoria you experience after completing this exalting visual odyssey will settle only after many long hours and then the realization will ultimately dawn - that you have been privileged to witness an classic that will be indelibly etched in cinematic archives.","

"The Avengers","bretttaylor-04022","17 January 2022","I have struggled with the four previous MCU films, I just did not find any of the characters relatable. I feel that this movie rewards you for watching the previous ones. Everything I hate about the characters the other characters are aware of and I then can relate to them this way, I don't believe this was the intention but it works for me. Also you can enjoy this film if you haven't seen the earlier MCU films because it doesn't go too deep into the characters, you just need to know the basics to enjoy it but it gives you a bit more understanding if you haven't. I think the balance between humour and tension is excellent. It is very funny when it needs to be. This could have so easily have been a disaster but I feel it is the simple story and excellent cast and the right dose of humour that makes it great. I also think if they had started with this the franchise would not have been as successful, it is the slow at times agonising build up to this that sets it apart from other franchises. It also makes sure it leaves enough for future films.","

"The Avengers","big_ryan15","25 April 2012","I've waited with baited breathe to see this movie for 4 years, ever since Sam Jackson turned up at the end of Iron Man in 2008 and uttered those words that made Marvel fans around the world weep happy tears: ""I'm here to talk about the Avengers initiative"". After 5 films I can happily report that my incredibly high expectations were not even close to high enough.The movie starts off with an introduction to each of our heroes and their antagonist: Loki. It's all pretty usual stuff from here. But once the heroes come together, the movie becomes something more. There are a lot of big egos flying around and each one is more used to being the centre of attention, especially Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. It's in these heated rows and witty banter that The Avengers becomes something that I really wasn't expecting: a family comedy. All these characters are so different and come from such different backgrounds that there is a lot of fun to be had by bouncing them off each other. The fish out of water gags at Captain America's and Thor's expense are great (""Easy there Point Break"") with Tony getting to roll off line after line of witty insults. And in the film's climax, Hulk gets most of the laughs as he smashes everything around him. The Hulk could easily have been the film's main weakness, Marvel had already tried bringing him to the screen twice with little success (Ang Lee's 2003 version being one of the most underrated superhero movies ever) but he ends up being one of the film's biggest strengths. Mark Ruffalo makes a great Bruce Banner as he actually gets to play both Banner and the Hulk through motion/performance capture (the first time ever that an actor has played both Banner and his massive alter-ego) and it works SUPER well. There was a huge cheer and applause when Chris Evans delivered the line: ""Hulk, SMASH!"" and Hulk proceeded to do so with much gusto.A few of the new characters and ones that were limited to cameos in previous films get their chance to shine here. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow gets to do more kicking (looking good doing it) and is given a love interest in Jeremy Renner's unbelievably bad-ass Hawkeye. Samuel L Jackson finally gets to spend more than 5 minutes on screen after showing up in 4 Marvel movies prior to this one as a part of his massive 9 picture deal with Marvel. Cobie Smulders (one can not measure her sex appeal) of How I Met Your Mother fame gets to show off her action chops as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill and the Stan Lee cameo is present of course.Which brings us to the film's action sequences. They are astounding.Like Transformers 3 astounding. Each one better than the last. An early 3 player bout involving Iron Man and Captain America try to take down Thor is great, but an aerial fight between Thor and the Hulk is better. But then there's the climactic ""glorious war!"" which really shows the potential of bringing this group together as they get to fight as a team. The problem with them on their own as demonstrated in previous movies, is that the film makers are limited to the adversaries to give their hero. Iron Man has just been fighting other men in suits, Thor monsters, etc. But now you can throw any enemies you want at The Avengers.The plot is relatively tight and clever, but the screenplay is the real hero; brilliantly written with some cracking dialog. Joss Whedon's directorial style translates perfectly into the blockbuster mold. The perfectly cast actors are all 100% comfortable in their roles and have great fun both bouncing off each other and uniting to fight as a team. The action sequences are breathtaking and the whole movie is terrific fun without being dumb or ""kiddy"" (Richie). In terms of where it stands in the pantheon of great comic book movies is strictly down to personal preference. But in my opinion this is the second best comic book movie ever (The Dark Knight wins out due to it's better story and villain) but is still one of the best action movies ever made.My one BIG problem with the film was the untimely murder of Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) at the hands of a rampaging Loki. I felt like this was merely a tool to evoke an emotional response (adding to his character arc) from Tony Stark, whom throughout the film mentions numerous times he wasn't even aware that Agent Coulson had a first name, but all of a sudden feels as though he had some kind of relationship with this character? I have LOVED every scene Agent Coulson has ever been involved in and I feel it was a large mistake to kill off one of the only genuinely relatable and funny human characters in the entire Marvel Universe. Perhaps in further films he will make a reappearance to collect his vintage Captain America collectible cards. One can only hope.Make sure you stay after the credits also, for those of you not in the know... be ready to google ""Thanos"" and the ""Infinity Gauntlet"" when you get home.All in all it was GREAT fun & I honestly can not wait for Whedon's Directors's Cut. A fun fact i read this afternoon involves Kevin Feige (Producer of every MARVEL film) already having plans to incorporate Spiderman and the X-men into future Avengers films, once they regain the film rights to these characters.REALLY looking forward to more Avengers. Fingers crossed Joss Whedon keeps his diary empty for many, many years to come.9/10 Well and truly Assembled.","

"The Avengers","mm-39","16 May 2012","The Avengers is okay. The movie has some weak points and strong points. The strong points out weight the weak points. The Avengers weak points are the script and special effects. The Avengers follow a predictable formula. The comic book hero scripts are redundantly formulated where a problem is created and then there is a final action showdown between good and evil. The viewers then experience the same seen it and done it before special effects. What make ""The Avengers"" stand out from other comic book movies is the character development. The Stark, and Hulk characters save ""The avengers""! Stark and Hulk create comic relief and interesting dialogue. When the Stark and Hulk disagree with the other super heroes their wit is hilarious. I give Avenger six out of ten.","

"The Avengers","leplatypus","12 January 2014","Sure, the special effects are amazing: if you remember the ""FF"" movies that are just a decade old, they appear now totally outmoded. If you compare with the ""Transformers"" that are more recent, sure, the movie is better visualized: it isn't a change of shoot each second, it's more focused about the characters and less on pure crazy action thus you can follow what happens. Sure, the casting is experimented and it was cool to see that Johnny Storm has become Steve Rogers as the actor was really cool in the aforementioned ""FF"" movies. Sure, it has some good lines (about Legolas), a real understanding of those icons (example: Hulk trying to move Thor's hammer), original new mysteries (who are the shadow people?). Sure, it adapts one of the best comics stories (the super hero who turns bad and destroys a Shielb base was Millar's ""enemy of the state""). And all this for only ""4"" ?Yes, because the first hour is totally boring: i have even slept in this black night. Also, because the screenwriter of super heroes lacks the talent of the comics writer. Stan the man who invented the Avengers could tell the same story in 22 pages: it was fast, easy to understand: Here, the plot is unintelligible, uses and abuses of scientific concepts and stupid name (tesserac?). Also, because i have the feeling to have missed a movie (what about the story about Black Widow and Hawkeye?). Also because the alien invasion is just destroy for destroy so the last hour is an astounding but hollow action scene. In conclusion, it's finally better than ""Daredevil"" but faraway of the classic Raimi's Spiderman!","

"The Avengers","KidDrehmann","5 May 2012","There are absolutely no words to describe the full percentage of enjoyment I received from this movie. The Avengers is phenomenal. Joss Whedon beautifully and artfully collaborates all of the greatness and magnitude of all the films leading to this one and directs an near exact adaptation of what Marvel always hoped the Avengers would look like on the big screen. To call this film an utter triumph would be a gross under-exaggeration. Containing some of the best action sequences ever captured on film, the wittiest and most hilarious humor I have seen, and probably the greatest chemistry between both characters and actors in cinema. Comic book fans and creators will leave theaters in an ecstasy of awe and amazement. May 4, 2012 should be marked down in the history books as the day comic book films successfully reached true perfection.","

"The Avengers","Aaron1375","14 May 2012","This movie has been a long time coming as it had its beginning in the 2008 film ""Iron Man"". There would also be ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Iron Man 2"", ""Thor"" and finally ""Captain America"". All these parts, left some wondering could they have this many superheroes in a film and it not turn out a jumbled mess? I never wondered that as all one had to do was look at the X-Men films and see that for the most part those films got it right, the main difference here was that different companies were involved so there may be some trouble. However, what we got was a film that brought a team of superheroes together and totally cranked up the action to the max. Yes, I have to say the action in this film is better than any action in other comic book films. It is not even close, they gave me here what I have been wanting! Do not get me wrong, the Batman movies are still great, I also enjoyed the Spider-man and X-men films, but this one just said this is a comic book film, and people want to see an epic battle, maybe even more than one! So no good, but relatively short fights like those found in most comic book films, we get lots of action and an epic finale! My favorite character on the Avengers is the Hulk, which explains why I did enjoy this film a good deal. He was finally done right, granted ""The Incredible Hulk"" was good too, but this was the best representation of the Hulk easily. He was presented as the strongest by far, though I nearly gasped when he and Thor faced off as I never saw that in the trailers so that was a nice treat for me and he did to Thor just what I wanted him to, punch him through something! Granted, Thor got some good hits in too, but I loved how they made it clear Hulk is the strongest one! Mark Ruffalo was also an improvement over Eric Bana and Edward Norton. He played Banner in a bit more nervous and skittish manner, unlike say Norton's who looked capable of putting up a fight without even becoming the Hulk. Hulk also got the biggest laugh in the theater I was in.So this film was everything I was hoping for and more. The rest of the cast was good too as Loki has come to Earth to capture the power of the cosmic cube (though he has someone behind him calling the shots). He plans of bringing an alien force to Earth so that he may become its king, he does this for no other reason than to irritate his brother, Thor it seems. He is still the same Loki from Thor, as you still do not know what he has going on in his mind! I was afraid he would not have this aspect in this film, but they were able to keep it. His alien force is great, and this makes for the great finale!The finale has the Avengers assembling and working together to stop the invasion and it is a grand spectacle to behold! So loved seeing the heroes utilize their skills and powers and every hero gets in some good hits. Black Widow and Hawkeye are expanded on in this film and they are pretty cool. If I were to have a complaint, it would be that there was one hero they under utilized a bit. In a film with so many heroes I guess it is to be expected, I was just surprised it was Captain America. He just did not play as big a role in the final fight as I would of liked. Sure he gave some orders, but his contribution to ending the assault was giving the Black Widow a boost. However, he was used well in the other scenes he was in, this is not a major gripe mind you...just if I can find something to complain about it is this. So in conclusion, I was impressed and loved this film. It was great to see this band of heroes slowly unite as it was watching Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury pulling the strings to get them to work together. Surprised he was listed last in the credit sequence at the end, because he played the most significant role in the film and was in it from the beginning to the end. The way it is performing at the box office also makes me think there is going to be a sequel for sure and that makes me ecstatic as they show who was calling all the shots and suffice to say I was not entirely sure who he was until he smiled and then I am like ""oh my god, yes!"" See this DC and Warner Bros, if multiple companies can come together and make an epic superhero team film then you can make a Justice League movie!","

"The Avengers","hoernkeem","7 May 2021","The Avengers (2012, Joss Whedon) (A)
I do have to hand it to Marvel and Kevin Feige. They pulled it off. So often something of this magnitude sounds amazing on paper or in theory, but rarely does it have the follow through especially when it comes to movies. This movie, however, is a home run in just about every sense of the word. After five films devoted primarily to the four main Avengers it is finally time for them to assemble and battle a threat worthy of this super team. Every primary actor returns with the notable exception of Edward Norton who is replaced by Mark Ruffalo who we would come to know as the MCU's face of the Hulk going forward. This super team will remain more or less together in this primary incarnation blowing our super hero film loving minds through 'Endgame' in 2019. Joss Whedon does a stellar job as a geek fanboy extraordinaire in the director's chair. This film combines a wonderful script with depth and plenty of the on the nose humor that these MCU films have excelled at. We get a villain in Loki and his alien invasion army worthy of the team and the stakes. None of the characters are short changed. They all get their moments to shine. The action scenes are wonderful especially the big finale battle that in itself must be practically thirty minutes of continuous action.The action stems from bad guy Loki, Thor's half brother, who, under the auspice of a mysterious benefactor, comes to Earth with a scepter of unknown power. His motives are mysterious, but ultimately it is revealed he is opening a way, utilizing the Tesseract from the Captain America film, for an alien army to invade Earth from space. He is initially demure in a deceitful attempt to divide our collective heroes, but really only serves to bring them together stronger against the adverse odds. Loki's spear also has a mind control power and he brings both Hawkeye and Selvig under his power further complicating the situation. There are some opening sequences once Loki is revealed bringing our heroes together finally, and despite some initial communication issues, and getting to know you stuff, they eventually reveal themselves to have great chemistry and camaraderie. The initial scene where Cap is fighting Loki and Iron Man swoops in is excellent as well as the subsequent scene where Thor, Captain and Iron Man initially fight over who should have custody of Loki before reaching an understanding. Hulk's appearances in the film are done excellently, but the moment of the film probably belongs to Tony in a singular self sacrifice when he flies a nuke through hole in space from which the invading army is entering from. He, in one stroke, destroys what remains of the army in space as well as diverting the nuke that was sent to destroy the aliens, and the island of Manhattan as collateral damage. The army is destroyed and the Avengers are assembled and Earth's mightiest heroes are here to keep us entertained for years to come.Until 'Endgame' came along this was the standard by which every other MCU film was measured. There may be slight issues here and there, but they are so slight as to nary merit a discussion. Everything here is operating at the highest level from script and direction to special effects to the actors essentially inhabiting these roles. At the end we even get the famous Marvel post credit scene which is the first appearance of the uber villain Thanos who would come to dominate the MCU narrative in the years to come. My love for this movie and all it accomplishes and represents cannot be overstated. We struggled through a lot of dark years with regards to super hero films. There were horrible writing jobs and horrible effects but we ate them up because at least they were something. Tim Burton started making it better but really the golden age commenced in 2008 with 'Iron Man' and Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'. No longer do we have to settle for sub standard comic book super hero fare. The MCU put an amazing capstone on their Phase One endeavor, and they would move forward and continue to impress and build on this world with every outing. This film is a triumph in every way.Eric's Grade: A.","

"The Avengers","faisal_khatib","11 June 2012","Two weeks after everyone else saw 'The Avengers', I finally got around to watching the film last week. A lot has already been told about it by the gazillions of reviews on the internet today. This review will get lost among all that noise so I chose to keep it short and simple.Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) brings together a group of superheroes i.e. Iron Man () and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) along with SHIELD agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to have a face off with a global threat posed by Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his army of Chitauri.A run-off-the-mill story about the bad guy revealing himself in the first half by stealing something powerful; then the good guys get defeated in the first round to perform the knockout punch in the finale, with a post-credits scene promising a sequel. Where it stands apart is the brilliant execution on the part of director/writer Joss Whedon who not only manages to balance all the power packed characters into a dynamic package but creates what possibly could be the best adaption of a comic book into a superhero movie. He keeps the audience on the edge of the seat with intense action ranging from 'in your face' hand to hand combat and 'zipping around Manhattan' flying exploits.Robert Downey Jr. when not suited up plays Tony Stark with immense amount of ease and charisma. Chris Evans seems out of place, which goes well with his lost in time character while Chris Hemsworth seemed a little underwhelming in comparison to his solo film act. Samuel L. Jackson had more breathing space with a lengthier role which was good to see while Tom Hiddleston as Loki was impressive as the outnumbered villain.Mark Ruffalo was a refreshing change after the previous actors who played Bruce Banner, while the interpretation of Hulk was the perfect hurrah for this amazing comic character that's been long overdue. The respect it deserves on the big screen was a long time coming.Scarlett Johansson sheds her 'Iron Man 2' eye candy role for something more in line with what you'd expect from the savvy spy - Black Widow. Unlike the trailers, Jeremy Renner had more to do than I expected which was pleasing and it would be great to see a film about the back story of Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson's character.Background score, screenplay, cinematography, costumes, CGI were all top notch. Not a chink in the armor. Support from Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgård was more than adequate without turning into cliché ridden monosyllabic characters that have plagued recent big budget films.The Avengers like someone on Twitter said, is the 'Star wars V (or was it VI?) of our generation'. A must-watch in the theatre though you can skip the 3D glasses if you want because I doubt it would reduce the awesomeness that is the film.","

I think some movie makers should pay us back the money we spent, but for the Avengers it is money well spent! The 3D effect is marvelous.Avengers is the squeal to Thor (I am very sure) , unlike Battleship uses John Woo's style slowly cooking the oven (too slow sometimes), Avenger is like a hot knife cutting the butter ----> straight to the point, I just love it.To watch this movie is like riding the world's best roller-coaster, I guarantee you that you will love it as well!","

"The Avengers","SnoopyStyle","17 August 2013","Nick Fury brings together Earth's mightiest heroes to stop Loki who is unleashing an alien invasion.Robert Downey Jr. makes this good and Joss Whedon makes this great. Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang, and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together.Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun.","

"The Avengers","joshuadrake-91275","14 September 2015","The Avengers is a great movie and I think it's because of what they wanted to do with this film in Phase One of Marvel's cinematic universe and this movie pays off quickly.The action is just amazing and the final fight at the end is just top-notch. You already know what the plot is about so I don't have to go over it, but I will say that the story was light hearted and dark at the same time and you had some humor. The ending fight was the longest fight scene ever shown in this film.Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and he does get a lot of screen time. Chris Evans plays Captain America and he does an amazing job, Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner were both good as Thor and Hawkeye and they have done a very interesting job with their characters. Mark Ruffalo was cool as Bruce Banner / The Hulk and he does motion capture for the Hulk and it was really great to see him as a superhero. Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff and she could not done better in this film, but the one person who really was great is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's brother and he makes a good villain. James Spader is gonna do better as the title character, Ultron in the upcoming sequel in the 2015 Marvel Studios film, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", which will be released this Friday on May 1st, 2015 and it is really cool to hear and see him as Ultron.Aaron Taylor-Johnson is going to rock as Quicksilver, but I think Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's sister, Elizabeth, is hot as Scarlet Witch and she's gonna do great in that part, but Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is good in the screen time he has in this film, but he only has a cameo or small part in the new Avengers movie, which I will review on Friday May 1st, 2015 and I think it's going to be a good film to start off the summer 2015 movie season.The visual effects are really impressive and really cool in this movie, especially The Hulk in this film. The music by Alan Silvestri is fantastic and amazing. I could not believe the music that I heard in this film and it was amazing to hear it. The film's running time feels like it's three hours long, but it is only 2 hours and 42 minutes long, so the movie moves on very quickly.Overall, I love THE AVENGERS and I am giving it an 8 / 10. Marvel has outdone themselves with this film and they will continue to outdo themselves with other future Marvel movies and it's not like every day that a four-year plan pays off with such praise and hype, but this paid off wonderfully.","

"The Avengers","TheHonestCritic","27 January 2022","""The Avengers"" (2012), I remember when this movie was first announced, the hype for it was insane. Truth be told, I was probably just as excited as everyone else. Ever since I saw the post-credit scene in ""Iron Man"" (2008), I thought: ""no, are they really going to go in this direction?"" Sure enough, the ending of ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008) confirmed that they were building up to teaming up the Avengers. For the next few years, I was eagerly waiting for ""The Avengers"" to come out. Eventually, at long last, it was released. The wait was absolutely worth it, and then some. In fact, ""The Avengers"" was actually even better than I thought it was going to be! It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner and Thor are recruited by Nick Fury and the spy agency S. H. I. E. L. D. to stop Thor's brother Loki from taking over the world. Now, to some, that story may sound a little bit too miniscule. However, for a film of this caliber, a simple plot is warranted. It allows for extra character development, as well as better action and fight scenes. In some cases, that may be too many characters for one movie alone, and there's not too much character development. But, here's the thing, in the films leading up to this one, we already met these characters and know everything we need to know about them. That's one critical thing Marvel did correctly, they did individual superhero movies and built up to the team-up. Whereas DC did it backwards, and did the climactic team-up first then the individual films later. They just had the heroes run into the action without any character development. That's one of the biggest cardinal rules of cinema, in my opinion, character development. Without that, then the movie won't have any impact. Marvel did it all correctly, and stared with character development first, and that's what allows for ""The Avengers"" to shine even more. Unlike watching modern day DC films, when you watch Marvel movies, you actually care about the characters and what's going on. Any way, I won't go into any details about the plot. But, I guarantee that it's a story that you'll remember for the rest of your life. This film may be 142 minutes in length, but it goes by in the blink of an eye. When a long movie goes by fast, you know it's a winner! As far as the acting goes, it's just as outstanding as the story itself. The whole cast gives it their all with their performances. That's another thing Marvel superhero films do better than DC, acting. Good acting is critical for a movie to stand out. It just shows how passionate Marvel Studios is, and makes this film all the more enjoyable. The cast is absolutely insane, their on-screen chemistry is impeccable! All of the sets/locations are beautiful, and give the film an stunning atmosphere. They really help make it look like a real-life comic book! As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, being made in 2012! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Alan Silvestri is exceptional and his film score sets the perfect tone for the movie. Alan Silvestri is one of my top ten all-time favorite film score composers, and the soundtrack for this movie is no different. Every film score I've heard written by him is very well done, to say the least and this one here is no different. ""The Avengers"" is a phenomenal superhero movie, and it has found a place on my top five favorite Marvel films. It's still just as fun to watch today, as it was back when it was first released. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""The Avengers"", what are you waiting for? Go and see it today! Just skip it's sequel, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), that movie sucks and it's easily the worst Marvel Cinematic Universe film. But, before you see ""The Avengers"", I recommend watching the first few movies first. It'll make the payoff with this film much more worth it. If you don't watch ""The Avengers"", look out for Loki!","

"The Avengers","Joshua_Barry","26 April 2012","So they all come together to fight a battle they cannot fight on their own. They don't exactly get along or have much appreciation for each other to begin with, but this is what makes this film work. This has been a long time lead up, starting back in 2008 with Iron Man and then ever so slightly linking each of these individual films together. It has been a hugely lucrative series for Marvel, sometimes good and other times not so good, it has all been leading to this point.For me, the picks out of these previous films are Iron Man and Thor, with The Hulk behind that and then right at the bottom, Captain America. Iron Man was fantastically fun with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr.), the larger than life character who has it all. He is smart, witty, funny and extremely like able and loves what most boys do, his toys. With a great visionary director in Jon Favreau at the helm both the Iron Man films were extremely enjoyable. Thor, had a great cast in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston. Kenneth Branagh really captured the fun and excitement of the story. The second attempt at The Hulk was quite good, but Norton, as much as I love him was not quite the right choice. The CGI Hulk was never really there yet and always felt very animated and never part of the furniture. Captain American, as a movie didn't work for me. There was not enough about him to keep me interested, not enough fun had. I love Chris Evans and thought he was the right choice, but with a fairly dull script and a much too serious approach, I was quite bored by the end.Now the question was always going to be, can they work as a group? With the much needed change of Bruce Bana to Mark Rufallo, and a few additional characters thrown in, the answer is a gigantic yes! Joss Wheddon does an amazing job of keeping a huge number of characters in tune. It is always the toughest element in story telling and here it really had a huge potential of being jumbled and disjointed. It is none of the above and on the contrary it is, in its entirety, exceptionally well balanced. The banter between the characters is priceless and gives the film a consistent flow and usually arises in what would normally be fairly dull background scenes. Everyone is extremely good, but the newcomer Mark Rufallo shines as Bruce Bana and 'the other guy'. The special effects for The Hulk are incredible and they have finally got him pretty much perfectly moulded into his surroundings. With the CGI sorted and the right actor behind the green monster, he seriously works and almost steels the show. Not quite, but he certainly steels any scenes he is in. Downey Jnr. as Stark is his usual witty, charming self and sets the banter off with great timing and finesse. Newcomers to the series in Black Widow played by the luscious Scarlett Johansson and Hawkeye played by the always solid Jeremy Renner are both commendable additions and both fit in marvelously. Tom Hiddleston as Loku, the villain of this story, plays his part impeccably well and deserves much praise and respect for this outing.The special effects are superb and the fight scenes are tremendous. Joss Whedon has definitely shown he is an avid comic book fan himself. He shows that he is not afraid to have fun with his material, and this really is the whole point. Where Chistopher Nolan has brilliantly turned Batman into a dark knight, Whedon constantly lightens the mood, which really is the only way this type of ensemble film could work. There is never a dull moment as the pace of the film is constant and this makes for a hugely entertaining film in ever way. This really is a perfectly made comic book adaptation.Smart, witty, funny, and hugely entertaining! This action packed joyride is brimming with different personalities, huge egos and awesome super powers. They work together perfectly in this marvel from Marvel! Go Joss!! filmnotion.com","

"The Avengers","Samiam3","16 June 2012","The Avengers is almost the definition of good time at the movies. Not burdened with the need to spend great amounts of time on character origins, this superhero film takes a conveniently short amount of time to put the game in play, and once it does that, the game is played with flair and showmanship.Quite frankly, the plot itself is absurd, but I guess that was bound to happen when you combine the worlds of five different Marvel heroes. In less capable hands, the Avengers may well have ended up getting muddled from trying to do too much. With Joss Whedon in the director's chair, it's actually a very strait forward two hours with a good level of focus.While New York ends up getting the same treatment as much of Michael Bay's resume, the experience is far less superficial. the Avengers does not insult our intelligence. quite the opposite in fact, it embraces it. The Avengers' best quality is that it never ceases to wink at itself. This is a movie where even the villains the same quick fire one liners as the heroes. A good protagonist of course is also the difference between good action movie and good movie. Simply put, these people (or rather super people) are just good fun to be around. While none of them are ever quite fully rounded, when they come together as a team, they seem far less superficial than they did in their individual movies. with the exception of Iron Man, the films of Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, were not all that memorable when it came to characters. The Avengers makes you realize how distinctive each character is.One thing I was a little disappointed in was Samuel L. Jackson. While he is very much at home in the role he plays, it seems pretty obvious that he's just playing himself. Perhaps, there is a hidden positive in this. As a supporting character, you don't wanna upstage the people who have top billings. Personally, I think he could've given The Avengers a little bit more love.Last summer was a somewhat underwhelming year for superheros. It's a pleasure then to see a film like The Avengers fly in to save the day. It's a film made with love, and the work has paid off.","

"The Avengers","DanLawson146","20 November 2021","POSITIVES:1) The film is shot very well. It's always clear what's going on in the action scenes, and there are also plenty of long takes and swirling camera movements
2) This is the perfect sized group for the Avengers. It's large enough that they feel like a team capable of defeating Loki and his army, but small enough that every member can be fleshed out and have their own character arc
3) I thought it was actually quite brilliant how Nick Fury is able to manipulate the Avengers using Coulson's ""death"" and the Captain America playing cards. It makes the whole arc of the team splitting up and then coming back together feel completely believable
4) The film does a really good job of bringing together all the Marvel films that came before us in a satisfying wayNEGATIVES:1) It really bothers me how Hawkeye and Selvig conveniently become cured from Loki's control just by hitting their heads. The convenience of Bruce Banner being ""always angry"" and able to become Hulk whenever he wants for the final battle is also bothering me
2) How do they all communicate with each other when they aren't wearing ear pieces? It's so annoying
3) When Captain America and Iron Man have to go and fix the SHIELD ship, Cap is easily able to fix some type of circuit board - how would he know how to do that when he comes from several decades ago??4) The humour is far too frequent in my opinion. It becomes really annoying. Iron Man especially; I know he's meant to be a funny character but he just became irritating - it was too much.","

"The Avengers","vg40","1 May 2012","I would give it 7 or 7.5 out of 10. It is a very good film, but nothing great. Believe me or not. I watched it yesterday night at the South Delhi PVR Priya Cinema Hall (3D; hated their scratchy defective glasses which needed changing for many people).The first half was just okay (actually even boring) and the intermission point was so ill-timed and then the second half was good. The fight scenes in the city (Manhattan) are like the latest Transformers. A one time watch for sure; but don't expect much. I liked the film but not as much as I had expected it to like! There are many enthralling scenes but the number of boring frames (particularly in the first half) is also abundant. The villain is not so menacing or dignified (like the all-powerful villain of X-Men 3). He needed more teeth. And I am not alone in thinking so; five of my friends with me have similar opinion. You don't miss much if you miss the Avengers.","

"The Avengers","nerminmer","30 January 2013","Anyone gave 5 to 10 stars for this absurdity who is past 18th birthday , not a comic book publisher Marvel Fanboy and does have a girlfriend please raise your hand.No one ? Thought so. The movie is atrocious. There is a plot a plus compared Transformers movies but it is so simplistic and full of tropes , deux-ex-machinas ( I lost count how many times Loki's magic staff was used to explain everything and advance story from brain washing to destroy portal opening device ) , stereotypes , predictability and cheap juvenile PG-13 jokes it becomes a parody. I wonder that was the intention. Self mocking with movie concept , characters , genre etc. Because there is no way this movie goes unpredictable or might surprise you. Ending credits might have said ""From producers of Scary Movie"" or ""Meet the Spartans"" Final CGI explosion filled fight scene (another parallel to Transformers movies ) against alien invaders where no one was harmed due to rating was so messy with headache inducing 3D scenery you either had to get out of theater for fresh air or close your eyes and ears ( I did former ) The result is box office inflated animation due to marketing hype. Except CGI special effects overuse it has little cinematic quality. Actors try to make something out of their characters but child like character material gives them little chance on that.Comic book fan boys. Please stop comparing your live action stuff with Oscar winning material. You display your ignorance and make yourselves ridiculous. Cinema does not revolve around you. I am glad that you got your live action clip but for the rest %99 of us living on this planet who do not know know or familiar with resource material The Avengers was badly edited , predictable (and sometimes cringe worthy) movie. And I am using ""movie"" term very lightly here.","

"The Avengers","lewiskendell","14 May 2012","I loved Iron Man and Thor, enjoyed Captain America: The First Avenger, and was slightly disappointed in Iron Man 2. But even the best of those movies were just a lead-up to The Avengers, which is absolutely one of the finest superhero movies, and one of the most entertaining movies of any kind, that I've seen.This is pure summer blockbuster fun. And I don't mean that in a way that limits the movie, but instead as an example of the best of what a summer blockbuster can be. The story is rather straightforward: a massive threat to Earth that's too big for any of our heroes to handle alone, and a rocky road of butting egos and misunderstandings stands between them and working together as a team. It's clear, easy to follow, and only has the briefest moments of lost momentum. The Avengers feels like it's the perfect length, with no action scenes that drag on too long into mindlessness or uneven pacing.What struck me most about it was the humor. It carried the movie even more than the excellent action scenes, the well-handled exposition or the interplay between our heroes. The Avengers is outright hilarious at times. The laughs are woven organically throughout. The tone of the movie just feels right, which is probably the best compliment that I can give it.I must say that my expectations were easily surpassed by the first assembly of the Earth's mightiest heroes. Marvel definitely made the right decision to carefully lay the groundwork for The Avengers the past few years, and it paid off. And it helps immensely that they chose the right man to write and direct it. Can't wait for Avengers 2!","

"The Avengers","DunkelheitVZ","27 April 2012","I am a huge Marvel geek, so if you are not 100% into Marvel or superhero movies, you should take the following with a grain of salt: Avengers is everything I ever dreamed of and lived for. It is like I was a child again, watching in awe with my mouth wide open.Whedon nailed nearly every single scene. He made every superhero movie which is already out look very outdated. This movie is 140 minutes maybe and 130 minutes are money shots. I have to find new superlatives and words are still not enough if I wanted to describe my feelings. And after seeing the trailer and the pictures, I already had high expectations.The charisma of Captain America, the wild brutality of the Hulk, the majesty of Thor, it was all there. I was never the biggest fan of avengers, but right now, after writing these lines, I am going to read up some avenger comic books from my collection and we have 2 am.THIS is how you spend 200 million on a movie.","

"The Avengers","EthanBJones_03","23 May 2017","'The Avengers' was directed by Joss Whedon and stars Roberty Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Tom Hiddlesticks(Hiddleston if it actually bothers you). It's the end result of 5 previous movies, combined into one awesome spectacular entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When a charming, likable British villain tries to attack Earth with his giant disposable CGI space army forcing some mentor like figure to form a super team, consisting of the protagonists from 5 completely separate movies rolled into one. And thus we have a Cinematic Universe. Thanks Feige. Your brilliance had doomed us all. The Avengers is one of the most likable, enjoyable, fun action/superhero movies that's ever been released and redefined a genre. Without this movie, all the cinematic universes we have today wouldn't exist(the debate on whether that's good or not is still open) and a superhero movie on this scale would have been attempted. Don't watch this movie expecting 'The Dark Knight' or 'X-Men' because this movie centres fun as its #1 goal and excels at it. All the cast is likable, the action is fun and it is overall just a great, big fun way to spend 2 hours of you life.As much as I praise this movie, it does have some flaws. The main flaw is the dull, generic and cliché ridden story which is just really poorly written. It follows the tropes way too closely and began the trend to have NO stakes in Marvel movies. I will also say the 'ending' should have had more of an impact and felt more important than it was so I would definitely say it should have been handled better. The end credits sequences are gold, though.Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man and is easily the best part of the MCU. On the flip side of this, I will say that I was very disappointed in Chris Evan's Captain America and I think his blatant lack of emotion and all times is unsettling and boring to watch. I understand the need of a straight man to keep the group in check but he was more like a robot than a human. Hiddlesticks was phenomenal as Loki and remains as easily the best MCU villain. He's smart, he's charming and, most importantly, he's British. That must be a requirement on entry to the 'Super villain Squad' because every villain in the universe is British(or at least the good ones are). Scarlett Johanson was good as Black Widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and Hawkeye. She may not be a critical member of the team but she's a female and yay for diversity. Mark Ruffallo was great as Bruce Banner and I adore how he refers to his alter ego as 'the other guy'. Jeremy Renner was fine as Hawkeye and remains the most useful Avenger with his SICK Archery Skills. Seriously though, he doesn't need to exist. Chris Hemsworth was good as Thor but not particularly memorable. Samuel Jackson is great as Nick Fury and a 15 rated movie of him would be comedy gold.The cinematography for this movie is great and I adore the tracking shots Whedon uses in the action and I think it benefits the action so much. Whedon CAN do action supremely well. The effects are amazing and are a delight to look at. The costume design was great and the set design was also really good. This movie needed to provide some fun action sequences, be funny and bring one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard Marvel fans. I can speak for two of them factors and say it achieved them. As for the third one, I can't comment but I will assume they were happy. In conclusion, this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movies of all time and is just great fun to watch. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend you do because it is pure, adrenaline filled enjoyment.9/10","

"The Avengers","cainita","16 April 2012","I have not bothered to write a review about a movie for a while, but this one deserves it. After seeing a screening of the film at Madrid, I can say that The Avengers is The best superhero movie ever made (TM). One of the reasons that make me think like this is that I didn't love all the individual films of the characters.Captain America was right, Thor is average but entertaining and a with an awesome casting, the Hulk only was interesting when the big guy smashed, the second Iron Man was awful.This film exceeds by far the sum of its parts.It is bright, cheerful, colorful. A film by gentlemen in pajamas punching bad guys. Even the Black Widow, totally plain in Iron Man, has a great girl power Whedon style role. It is full of references to the readers, but I swear that every one has a twist that makes them even more fun.Of course, you have some script inconsistencies, and failure to apologize for cursing! Is a comic of gentlemen in pajamas, not The Regent! It has both humor grateful to see the original version and I have no doubt that the dubbing stamina.I wanted to applaud, to cheer... I wish you a experience like mine, with all the cinema enjoying. It is an experience that reminds us that sometimes, just sometimes, a film is much more than watching alone a movie surrounded by other people.Some might say that the Batman movies are better. I would say they are even different genres. Spiderman 2 is the only superhero movie that genuinely, in my humble opinion, can compete.Nobody here is going to win an Oscar, but that does not mean that it can not win a special place in your hearts.And the post-final after the credits ... Okay I expected it. But here we have our final wink, the ultimate gift for those who have spent years reading Marvel comics. A subtle phrasing full of a meaning that only comic books fans will understand.","

"The Avengers","superindrajit","27 April 2012","I don't care about what some people say on how this movie just had action and no story and cheesy humor because those people obviously have no taste. Anyways, I just got a chance to see the most awaited film of 2012 and honestly, I wasn't disappointed. The movie was actually the most epic movie I have seen so far. Yes, I might change this decision after I see The Dark Knight Rises or MIB 3 but this movie has certainly impressed me. The movie has major plus points and one of them is the dialogs. The mix of action and humorous dialogs entertain and provide good moments to appease the audiences. I am sure, several people loved the dialogs but I just admired them. The action scenes, were not overdone and were certainly better than G.I Joe series which was not really anything impressive for me. But, there is a lot more to this film that gave me that feeling that this is the epic movie and It wasn't a waste to wait for so long. The action scenes are good, though there was a lot of explosions, they impress. The best part is the acting, our superheroes and even our villain say funny dialogs and perform good action. Plus, the story is effective for a 2 hour movie as many movies longer than 1 hour 30 mins are usually lagging in parts and fail to present a good story. But, this movie doesn't drag and doesn't make you fall asleep. Acting is top notch, Robert Downy Jr. is the best, Thor is good, Captain America, the rest are awesome. In general, this movie was damn good. I wasn't bored, and I enjoyed every freaking moment.","

Prior to this I had been somewhat disappointed. Iron man was ok but Captain America was a kind of fun but boring and Thor was perfectly cast but quite poor. Hulk was well Hulk and a shambles. The Avengers tho was a wow. Great action, great interaction between cast, a new awesome hulk and what a villain in Tom Hiddleston's Loki. The final 45 minute Manhattan battle was simply superb.

"The Avengers","x_manicure_x","24 August 2021","The Avengers didn't age well but is a highly entertaining movie regardless of your knowledge of its characters and universe. Sure it's cliche and super predictable just like any other superhero movie, but remember this is nothing that you should take seriously. It's just a big excuse to get all your favorite characters kicking each other's butts on screen with great special effects. Compared to all previous MCU movies it's very well-paced and while being fun and self-mocking it never gets to unbearable peaks of trashiness. The writing was surprisingly well-cared too this time. The characters have good chemistry, and each one of them gets introduced the right way, with the right amount of information being given still without getting too verbose. I still don't think that having Hulk suddenly being able to control his powers is a good idea though. It pretty much kills the whole concept of being indestructible but a threat to anybody around him at the same time. I understand that there are times he can't control himself when under stress like in the first part of the movie, but it's still too much of an easy card to play. Having the Avengers use his powers against the enemies but struggling to keep him in control at the same time would be more believable and balance the game better. Also Loki after being presented as the ultimate bad guy the first half of the movie gets completely lost after the aliens come in. Didn't feel his threat at all.","

"The Avengers","bob the moo","6 September 2012","You could be forgiven for approaching this film with trepidation for many reasons. The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film – a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though, a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.Ironically enough though, the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines, rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didn't particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same, with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am), these aliens aren't really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection, Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it, giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the ""puny god"" moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans, who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk, again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces, none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes, nothing something that always delivers, but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful, busy, fun and generally very entertaining – it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this.","

"The Avengers","osvazas","11 May 2012","I don't usually write reviews and I am not an expert on analyzing all that cinematographic stuff or how god of a job director did. All I can say is that I had a time of my life. It was an amazing film with an amazing storyline and amazing actors in it. When I first heard about the avengers, I was very happy yet skeptical about it. My biggest concern was how they were going to put all these legendary characters into one film and provide them all with enough screen time to achieve some character development. Even after seeing it I have no idea how they did it, but they not only did it they smashed it. Right from the start I was taken to a ride of my life, I could not take my eyes out of what was going on. In terms of special effect, it was top-notch as it was expected no question about it. People are praising this film for being very witty and having a lot of comedy in it, I have to say I am not a fan of comedy, but this film made me laugh more than any other comedy in a very long time. Having to see Hulk smashing Loki or Capitan America patronizing Iron-man, or Iron-Man fighting Thor, was something you could have dreamt of to see on the big screen when you were a kid. But having a chance to see it done and developed in such an effective and spectacular fashion was beyond my wildest expectations, and trust me I had very high hopes for this film. Well, sorry for not being very structured and coherent about the whole thing, I just wanted to share a little bit of joy and excitement that I have been provided with watching this amazing film. It's an epic masterpiece, and seeing it on the big screen is a one of those things you have to do before you die, that's for sure.","

"The Avengers","wavecat13","31 October 2019","I heard somewhere this was the first great Marvel flick, or this was the one to watch first, or something like that. Overall, it was entertaining but nothing special. The characters and story are pretty cliched. Some powerful object (a tesseract) falls into the hands of a malicious superhero (Loki, well played by Tom Hiddleston) and a crew comes together to try to get it back from him before he can pass it to the evil aliens who want to destroy Earth. They try to liven things up by creating some character and conflicts and the like, but for the most part it is a snooze. Downey's Iron Man is ironic and witty, Thor turns out to be the estranged brother of Loki, yeah yeah. These kinds of flicks are plug and play, get some star actors and plug them in, and so long as they look the part, things work out. It is fun to watch them flying around midtown Manhattan and smashing things up. The effects are the real stars.It is interesting to note that like our ancestors from previous centuries, the modern world wants to have its myths and its heroes - I guess old habits tend to stick around. But these myths mean very little and serve mostly to keep people's eyes glued to a screen.","

"The Avengers","maverick-352-622235","24 April 2012","The wait for this movie has been excruciatingly long, ever since we saw the preview that was attached to Captain America. Here's what I thought of the movie when I caught the premiere.You get the best of Joss Whedon and that is quite a lot:1. Black Widow is no longer just a piece of eye-candy. Did you seriously expect the creator of Buffy to just let his female characters stand around looking pretty? She kicks ass and how! (Yes, and it's about time!)2. For all the newbies out there that haven't watched some or all of the previous movies, the rest of the characters are thoroughly fleshed out. You get a long explanation about what they have been up to since their story last ended. So, it's possible that the first half may be a tad slow for the die-hard fans, but the second half more than makes up for it. Also, for what it's worth, isn't it better to know what the characters have been doing all this while, before they get down to some serious action?3. The post-credits scene. Oh My God! There is no point, whatsoever, in going to watch the movie if you don't wait for it. You simply HAVE to see it. 4. On a side-note, if you're relatively new to the Marvel universe, you must see The Superhero Squad Show (Yes, it's a cartoon, and no, it's not a very serious one either. But looking past all that, it's a serious refresher course in everything Marvel) before the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, as it really helps you understand the characters. I wouldn't have understood the importance of the post- credits scene without it. 5. The fight sequences (the gist of which we all saw over and over again at Comic-Con!) finally makes it look like we are watching a superhero movie. It's not one until some old-fashioned ka-pow!6. And yes, there are many scenes which are a fanboy's (or girl's) most awesome-est dream come alive!You also, however, get the worst of Whedon, which I admit, I pretty much dreaded. I won't say what it is, as it will spoil it for you, but it's really very obvious if you've seen anything of Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (my opinion may not, however, be accurate, as some might argue that what we've seen is actually, his best) Whatever the general consensus, there is no doubt that Whedon gives his best shot at leaving his mark in the Marvel 'verse (!) and his best is pretty darn good!If I simply HAVE to find flaws in the movie, the only one I can think of right now is that some important Avengers - Ant-Man, Wasp, Black Panther and Vision - are nowhere to be seen. Black Widow was the only token female in this all-testosterone group, so Wasp would have been a welcome addition, as the scales would not be so unbalanced.The Avengers works because underneath all the larger-than-life heroes with their huge egos, their actions and emotions are just human enough to be believable. Things do not just fall in place - everybody does not magically get along with each other and fight away to glory - they had to work hard to make it happen. And that, is this movie's biggest USP.All-in-all, go watch the movie, if not on the first day, then at least some other time for as long as it's on in the theaters. Your first glimpse of this movie just HAS to be on the big screen.","

"The Avengers","DubhDoo","17 June 2012","So here it is. After nearly fifty years, The Avengers have finally made the transition from page to screen, and best of all, it does not manage to disappoint. Much of this is down to Joss Whedon and the pitch-perfect casting.At first, the choice of Whedon as director surprised me somewhat. I really like Whedon, don't get me wrong, but with a background in television and his most notable cinematic efforts being the screenplay for the first 'Toy Story' and the unfortunately overlooked 'Serenity', he struck me as an odd choice. But make no mistake, that even with millions more dollars at hand, Whedon fortunately remains true to himself; keeping humour in sight, with plenty of instantly quotable quips and wisecracks throughout. He is confident and assured with these treasured characters, managing to juggle all these superheroes (and one super ego).We're all used to (most of ) the cast members by now; Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Chris Evans as Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Tom Hiddleston as Loki; but we also have some new players in the form of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as Hulk. What is most brilliant is that all the actors impress. I was eagerly anticipating seeing Evans as Rogers again, after falling in love with his solo effort, but it was in fact Ruffalo who struck me the most. His portrayal as the tortured Bruce Banner was nuanced, believable and very human, applying emotion to a difficult role. Hiddleston was true pleasure as the villainous Loki, giving a fantastic performance and wonderfully delivering many great lines.One quibble I had was Hawkeye's lack of screen-time, but that can be ignored as I suspect he will either get a spin-off or have a larger role in the sequel. This is the very opposite to say Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy; instead of being dark, realistic and multi-layered, this is the very synthesis of a big, bright summer movie, a blast from start to finish with humour and large action sequences. While Loki's army were a bit too Transformers-esque for my liking, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film, and exited the cinema with a satisfied smile on my face. Overall, an excellent blockbuster which deserves the praise it's getting. All I want is for Whedon to the sequel.","

"The Avengers","achyutaghosh","27 April 2012","The elders say that two is company, anything more is just a crowd. Avengers shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore, and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas! With an ensemble star cast, a fast, witty script, thrilling action sequences, and masterful direction, it is the perfect superhero movie, one which will charm not only the nerdy fans, but also the uninitiated.The Avengers project began over 6 years back, when Marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen, but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first. Each of them were characterized by action, humor and a certain degree of insaneness. The movies generated big bucks at the box office, but i always felt Marvel was holding back something- whether the grandness of plot, or the scale of action. This is what it was saving for, no holding back for the $220 million mother of all actioners, Avengers- 6 superheroes, one mental Norse God, a full scale alien invasion- this one has got it all.The story picks up plot strands from the previous movies- Loki steals the Tesserect, a cube like artifact which is a source of great power, which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade Earth. Post credit scenes in the older Marvel movies show that Nick Fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day- where the Earth will be ""hilariously out gunned"" and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team. To form an unbeatable squad, each superhero gets something to the table- Hulk brings the muscle, Captain America brings strategy, Ironman brings style and technology, Thor brings emotion along with Godlike fury, Hawkeye brings steely sincerity and Black Widow brings smoking-hot sexiness. But before they can take on Loki and his minions, they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team. Much of the film's uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes. The climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last year's Transformers- dark of the Moon, but is infinitely more enjoyable, each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team, each sequence bettering the previous one. The movie's biggest strength is its star cast- Robert Downey as Ironman, continues from where he left off in Ironman 2- ""billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist""- he calls himself, as he lends sarcastic humor to an ""oh so serious"" group. Chris Evans as Captain America might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity. Chris Hemsworth as Thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil, while Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson as Hawkeye and Black Widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the A-team. However the scene stealers were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Hiddleston's Loki. Ruffalo is probably the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, and while Edward Norton and Eric Bana played the role with intensity, Ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humor. Trust me, with or without pants, the Hulk will keep you in splits, but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the Hulk delivers the coup de grace to Loki. Loki's expression immediately after- priceless :) Speaking of whom, the star of the movie IS Loki- a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain (think Joker in the dark Knight or Doc Ock in Spiderman 2)- and in Avengers, Hiddleston plays Loki in a manner that man to man, he stands head and shoulders above the heroes. This Loki, like most super villains has a sinister, single point agenda- to rule the world, and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him, in of all places, Germany- not-so-long-ago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world. When Loki is captured and held in a glass cell, he gives a little bit of the Hannibal Lecter treatment to Scarlett.You do a far better job if you love what you do, and director Joss Whedon is a certified geek, having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series. The biggest input that Joss Whedon brings, is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it- ""hold on"", he seems to say, ""the solution is just round the corner""- it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously, unlike the DC Comic adaptations. Avengers is a celebrity jamboree of sorts, and yet Whedon manages to give each star his place, each character, his due Avengers weighs in at 146 minutes, but to his credit, Whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout, whenever things begin to sag, jokes, punchlines, and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong. To sum up, Avengers is a superlative effort. Mixing fantasy, science fiction, imagination, colorfully dressed he-men, this is the film Marvel fans have been waiting for ages- they took their time, but they delivered on all counts. This is a no holds barred, effects driven, mass appeal blockbuster par excellence, absurdly entertaining- these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in Asgard for geeks such as me, and will sure extend its magic to the non fans. There are so many characters, yet it never felt too many, production values are solid, the script engaging, with loads and loads of nonstop action. There are minor flaws, but this is THE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER OF THE YEAR. Geeking out has never been so much fun.","

"The Avengers","ssvfolder-1","14 June 2019","How is that this movie is so good even after masterpieces of phase three? I re-watched it two times in a row (which makes it a total of 6) and still loved every moment of it. If I have to guess it's the amazing chemistry between the actors and a great writing (unlike awful Game of Thrones,season 8), which makes it tick. There are no grade A actors in it , aside perhaps Robert Downy Jr. and Sam L Jackson, yet in this one, every one is a star. Both Evans and Hemsworth embrace their role to perfection and aren't just a pretty face. They are captain America and Thor respectively, and I cant' imagine anyone else in that role. A typical acting of Mark Ruffalo, actually works perfectly and one might say that he did his difficult role of Hulk even better than Ed Norton, whom I personally consider to be one of the best, though notoriously known difficult to work with, actors. Scarlet Johanson Gave a superb performance and for me this is one of her best movies ever. Not to forget everyone else, who gave an outstanding performance. This movie is not without its flaws, yet the sheer enjoyment and inspiration it provides, makes up for it. I will give it a 10/10 rating, as this is a movie that started an Avengers craze for me, so all the other movies, even the bad ones, fall into their place in this epic movie series.","

"The Avengers","davek28","16 October 2012","I don't usually comment on a film for which I'm completely neutral, but this film deserves a neutral comment as it's such a waste of time and money. It exhibits the typical American obsession with violence and little or no character development. After fast-forwarding through all the crash bang wallop scenes and still keeping track of the plot, I still didn't care what happened to anyone, including the planet.Scarlet Johansson is completely miscast as the Black Widow. She should be tall and willowy. Mark Ruffalo is perfectly cast as the Hulk as it suits his style of acting, which is usually dumb.I really am a fan of Joss Whedon and own the entire Buffy collection, but I counted two - maybe three - snappy lines of dialogue in this. Very disappointing.I was going to give it 5 out of 10 but decided it deserved 6 towards the end - barely. Just too corny for words and silly in the extreme.","

"The Avengers","jrwilson7","27 April 2012","Everybody take note! The superhero film genre has just been ramped up a gear or two, in fact, someone has rammed the throttle into overdrive and that someone is Joss Whedon. For those of you who don't know who this man is, he's been around a while, but not as famous as other directors. First and foremost, he is a writer. We have him to thank for films like Toy Story, Titan A.E., Atlantis and Alien Resurrection. He is also the writing and directing genius behind TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Dollhouse and the short lived Firefy (among others) and he is no stranger to directing big action movies. He helmed the Firefly spin off movie, Serenity. But, this is Whedon's first big feature film, it's also his first blockbuster and there is a lot riding on the success of this film.The Avengers is a long time coming. There have been numerous directors attached to it, a number of scripts, and of course, six other films preceding it (I am including the original Hulk). Making it work has been no easy task. Each character has their own successful film franchise (Thor 2 and Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 are due out in the next two years) with plots, subplots and narratives that have loosely been tied together with short end-of-credits scenes involving Nick Fury and the Avengers Initiative.In the first issue of the comic , the team are assembled to fight Thor's brother Loki who has used his power of illusion to persuade the Hulk onto a part of destruction. Whedon has used these elements as his inspiration to create a strong script and storyline that successfully pulls together some of cinemas biggest personalities (and egos) and not only develops their characters further but broadens their appeal.The story is over the top, but not enough that you find yourself scoffing. The reality is that you need to suspend disbelief when dealing with characters from other worlds, aliens and magic! And considering the source material lends itself to be over the top anyway, the beauty in Whedon's script is that it never once takes itself seriously. (SPOILER) Even when S.H.E.I.L.D.S super-sized aircraft carrier turns into a flying invisible fortress, Nick Fury states, ""Let's dance"" as reflectors cover the ships surface much like a mirror-ball, rendering it completely invisible to the naked eye! Over the top? Hell Yes! The first act sees the assembly of the Avengers. The Cap and Bruce Banner are asked to find Loki and the Tesseract he has stolen from Shield. Later Thor and Iron Man join the team with Hawkeye and Black Widow. What works well is that when the four superheroes and superegos come together, each thinks they will save the day, but as their egos compete against one another for attention, the typical alpha-male muchoness comes to the fore, causing disunity and damage – a lot of damage!It is not until part the way through the second act that the team pulls together for the greater good, which is to save humanity from total destruction at the hand of Loki and his alien army.The script is what makes this film and is proof that studios should trust ""fan boys"" with comic book adaptions. Whedon has used his extensive knowledge and passion to write a story that is appealing to all audiences while combining what we love from the original films. There are plenty of references to the ""prequels"" and the character traits each has developed and bring with them and for the fans, easter egg references to the comics to satiate their appetite. It is film is funny. Very funny. The Hulk almost steals the show (spoiler) when he throws Loki around like a ragdoll during his ""I am a God"" speech, but each character gets a few choice lines that will surely become part of our vernacular. At times I thought I was in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, considering the scale and grandeur of the film's final act – the near destruction of New York. Although there are hallmarks to DOTM, Avengers is nothing like it, in fact, Whedon proves he is the better director by piecing together huge battle sequences, action, explosions, while ensuring that each character has plenty of screen time that not only makes sense, but doesn't get lost in the enormity and scale of it all.The production flawlessly merges CGI and live action together, but the 3D conversion leaves little to be desired. Considering the success of Tron Legacy, I am surprised Disney (who owns Marvel) didn't pull out all the stops and have it filmed in 3D.I have long appreciated Whedon's film making abilities and here he channels the work he made famous in Serenity, those fast zoom shots of ships exploding are used here, but not overdone. He also shoots action from interesting and random angles often panning through the back of destroyed cars and broken windows and styling shots that replicate comic book frames, which many fans will appreciate, but most will miss.The Avengers proves that comic book adaptions can work in the right hands and that screenwriters and directors need to have some understanding of what they are working with.This is the BEST comic book – SUPERHERO – film I have seen and is the mark by which all future films will be judged by.","

This is a movie where every penny spend by the producers and the consumers is worth spend. Movies with so many superheroes are 90% of the time destined to be a chaos. Yes there is chaos, but its not the movie but in the heart of Manhattan which is the battleground. Awesome dialogues, rightly timed humor and incredible action.

"The Avengers","marcm-8","22 July 2012","Guess I expected more but shouldn't from a comic book company. I did think that much of the acting was above par and quite good in many instances. However, the poor relationship to obeying or at least extending the laws of physics was just inexcusable. I'll try to precisely explain my sentiments: 1) what's the logic in having an aircraft carrier fly? A runway on a ship that's supposedly capable of flying? If it's possible to make a ship like that fly, then wouldn't it also be possible to have other flying craft that don't need a runway? Get a scientist to review your scripts before hand!2) The scant one-liners from Robert Downey, Jr's character were annoying at best. Guess he's an ADD/ADHD character trying to appeal to multitude of ADD/ADHD fans?3) All the hand waving over and around computer screens reminded me of the bad attempt at impressing the viewer that occurred in ""Minority Report"" Make the hand waving meaningful and minimal. If those screens were really needed, then Dr. Banner/Hulk would have gotten some use/knowledge or gained something from all his hand waving over supposedly touch-sensitive screens. Yet, both he and Mr. Downey (and others) seems obsessed with waving their hands around - for what? I did enjoy Samuel Jackson's character when he responded to the lame navigator's excuse ""the navigation system is reinitializing..."" and he says is the ""Sun up, then put it on your left"" That was the most genuine moment in the whole film.I expected the superior plot and complexity of ""Thor"" but was sadly disappointed with an rehash of ""Independence"" style special effects and a lame story of alien invaders. All this mediocrity probably didn't impact the title's earnings. I just won't be so enthused about catching a sequel. Maybe worth a Netflix or video store rental but not a theater ticket!","

"The Avengers","swiftnick47","26 April 2012","Everything just worked perfectly for The Avengers. My geek heart jumped several times during the movie. So many cool and memorable action scenes, great comic timing, It is just epic in every way. The overall story is simple (evil guy wants to dominate earth), but it doesn't matter because it still carries depth due to the previous movies which are tied together seamlessly with this one. The chemistry between the actors are perfect, and skeptics don't worry, Caps suit is not bad looking at all and there is a perfectly fine explanation for why it does not look as high tech shiny as the rest of The Avengers, but for that one, you need to watch the movie. Experiences like this is why cinema is still the best place to watch epic action movies, and The Avengers is nothing but EPIC!","

It's just damn fun. And without any agendas pushed down our throat all the better for it!!!All the characters are great here, the evil Loki, grand Thor, proper Captain America, and even hawkeye, hulk and black widow are better than I remembered.

"The Avengers","cyasin95","28 August 2012","The movie was absolute trash. Horrible scripts, least menacing villain ever, no chemistry between the actors, and mundane story line. The movie was immensely over hyped and definitely does not deserve anything near a 8.5 rating. Its alright as a kids movie. It does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2. The movie is often commended for its humor. In my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile. Nothing special at all, despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie. So if you want watch at least a decent super hero flick you might as well pick up Watchmen, X-men first class, Spider man 1 or 2 and of course the batman trilogy.",NA
"The Avengers","James-p-r","19 May 2012","UK title ""Avengers Assemble""/ Rest-Of-World ""The Avengers"". Just like ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"", this film was eagerly anticipated by fans, such as myself. I could not wait for the film to be released on 26th April. Unlike ""TF3"" however, this film live up to the hype. It surpassed my expectations (and I expected a lot). It didn't feel forced and certainly did not feel like a sequel to one particular lead-up film. It felt like a well-made sequel to ALL the films.The final battle wasn't just an all-out brawl - it seemed integral to the story and characterisation of the film. Every character had their ""time to shine"" and they were as you remember them from their ""build-up"" films - Tony Stark was cocky, witty and likable, Steve Rodgers was patriotic, a ""man-out-of-time"" and focused on the mission and Thor was a demi-god warrior. Then there's the Hulk, played by Mark Ruffalo instead of Ed Norton this time around. This Hulk/Banner was perfect. Ruffalo brought a sense of humour to this famously angry character and really helped pull-off the Hulk where others have either tried and failed (Hulk 2003) or tried and only just failed (The Incredible Hulk 2008). We also got a brief look at Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson)'s background and her relationship with Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Even next to their super-powered team-mates, these two proved their worth to be part of the team.Tom Hiddleston as Loki was brilliant, Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury was what you'd expect from this actor, Clark Gregg was once again great as Phil Coulson and Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill was a good decision and while her performance was good I feel she was underused. This film has and amazing soundtrack, brilliant actors, likable characters (even Loki), great 3D effects, an enjoyable story and epic action. Congratulations and thank you to Director Joss Whedon and the rest of the crew for putting together a masterpiece.",NA
"The Avengers","sidfargas","25 April 2012","Ladies and gentlemen, WE HAVE A WINNER! Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, the Avengers mix everything so well. It leans to the dark but touches on fun and the interaction of every character just enough. Maybe it's the fact that all the lead characters got their chance to be introduced in their own movies or maybe it's because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and believable. It's truly better than any other comic-book based movie that I have ever seen. I say that not to egg on fans of other properties because I AM a fan of other properties. Because of the groundwork that has come before and because of the high level that this film operates, it IS bigger than any have ever delivered. ALL the dramatic beats really click. Besides the depth and action pieces, so much of the humor works because it is so well written. The writing displays true character establishment and development over the course of the film but never gets bogged down by the shear number of characters. What's also rare for any summer movie is that just about every scene packs real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable movie that people will be talking about for years to come. The TV clips seen leading up to the movie tease at the action but there is SO much they saved for the actual running. I can't thank them enough for that factor. They knew they had a hit on their hands so why spoil the word of mouth! If you liked the trailers and TV stuff, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET! That in and of itself was a pleasant surprise. Avengers is a complete and very well done movie and as much fun as I've ever had in the cinema. That's no lie or no joke.",NA
"The Avengers","bradykitchen-33648","3 January 2022","This is the movie that made me fall in love with movies. Growing up I was obsessed with superhero's. DC, Marvel it didn't matter I loved it all. So when I saw this for the first time in theatres I was in awe.The film does a phenomenal job of managing the amount of characters it has. Each character has a purpose and each character is interesting.Iron Man for me was extremely unlikeable in Iron Man 2 but in this I liked him a lot. There are moments when he is still a douche but most of the time he is showing that he is meant to be there and that he wants to help people.This was the first time we see Mark Ruffalo has Bruce Banner. I think he did better than Norton did, he brings a more humanistic tone to the character.Black Widow was given much more screen time in this than she was given in Iron Man 2 and Scarlett Johanssen did great.Tom Hiddleston is the perfect person to play Loki. His ability to portray this menace of a god is amazing. I will say the plot of Loki wanting to conquer the earth is very simplistic but that didn't bother me much.The gripes I have with the film is the first 50 minutes or so is very slow. They find the proper pacing once everyone is together but the beginning wasn't paced well. Also strongly dislike Captain Americas suit. It is cheesy and doesn't fit well.The Avengers is every kids dream come to life. It is perfectly acted and Joss Whedons ability to manage that amount of characters is amazing.

"The Avengers","julian-mumford","28 April 2012","The ultimate superhero mash up from Marvel Studios.Following the huge success of Iron Man (Robert Downey Junior) and the relative healthy returns for the lesser known Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (now Mark Ruffalo) and Captain America (Chris Evans), the obvious monetary synergy of all four characters in the same movie is obvious.Adding to the mix, we have tight leather clad Black Widow (Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner) along for the ride, following their brief appearances in the previous films. On Bad guy duties we have Loki (Tom Hiddleston), hell bent on creating a portal to earth to allow his army of minions to flow through and capture the world, making him the undisputed leader of, well everything.On paper this should not really work, we have numerous superheroes all with very different powers, origin stories, character arcs and so forth. Somehow writer and director Joss Whedon, of Buffy and Serenity fame, manages to create a cohesive whole. Each character gets to contribute and have their moment or two in the sun, no-one appears sidelined for too long. The ultimate tag team if you will, even Agent Phil gets his chance to shine.Whedon is far to sharp to allow proceedings to get too pretentious, for every hint of comic book mythology a pin is on hand to puncture the balloon, audiences and characters clearly instructed not to take all this too seriously.Complaints, the film does feel long and there are shades of ""Transformers 3"" in the climactic scenes, have we not done organic alien monsters destroying skyscrapers? The story is largely irrelevant, all the crew are called together by Nick Fury (Samuel LJackson) in full, ""hell yeah"" mode, to defend the earth against this ultimate threat. Loki wields his staff with aplomb, initially stealing away Hawkeye and Selvig (Skellan Skarsgard). We know they are working for the wrong side due to their crazy eyes, until of course they experience some cognitive repair surgery, or get bashed on the head, dependent on your medical training.The effects are top notch, production values off the scale and it is obvious the director has a firm grip on the material and belief in his characters. All participants appear to be having a whole lot of fun and it comes across on the screen.Who would have thought a few years ago that cast lists of this quality would be lining up to play Comic Book heroes, how times and story lines have changed.So to the characters. Stark is just Stark, every mans wish fulfillment, rich beyond dreams, able to ignore anyone and everyone, good with the ladies but now settled with the radiant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Thor continues to talk in Nordic God like speak, which never gets old. The trusty hammer Mjolnir gets a good work out here, incidentally Natalie Portman's character is referenced but not shown on screen.Captain America is tried and true, embodying a dependable ""old world"" can do attitude, which is a pleasant antidote to Iron Man's showy pursuits. Evans does well here, actually anchoring the character somewhere firm amongst all the chaos.Strangely the character that should not work at all, just maybe steals the show. The ""Hulk"" whose character development in real life now has morphed through three ""A"" list actors, is the obvious crowd pleaser. He also gets the best two laughs in the film and the least expensive wardrobe, just a torn shirt and some cut off jeans.The Hulk is played rather well by Ruffalo, bringing something to the role that Norton or Bana did not find. The big guy remains under wraps for quite some time but when he gets angry, he sure makes some mess.Clearly the studio are thinking big, stay for the set up as it is clear the ""Avengers"" work is not done yet.Summary Yet another high for the comic book genre, post modern and self knowing in the approach, this works better than anyone might have dared to expect.Big, loud, expensive comic book superhero mashup. Not to be taken seriously, just enjoyed for the spectacle on show and the obvious thought, care and intelligence invested in the series.Recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",NA

"The Avengers","Willie-12","4 May 2012","It has been a long time since I've anticipated a summer movie season as much as I've anticipated 2012's. And what better way to kick it off than with one of the most anticipated movies of...well if not the decade, then at least the last 5 years. The Avengers was a very impressive accomplishment by Joss Whedon, and it was well worth the wait. This is one of those movies that had its work cut out for it for quite some time. This was going to take some skill as a movie-maker. How in the world would anyone be able to bring all of these larger-than-life characters together in such a way that it would not seem too jammed packed and jumbled up for its own good? How would all of these heroes be showcased in a movie that is almost all main-character and lead actor? And to answer those questions, all I can really say is this: I don't know. And after seeing the movie, I still don't know. All I know is that it was done, and it was done very well. I have to admit, when I found out Whedon was going to be at the helm for this one, I had some doubts (which, I'll admit were only based on my lack of attention to most of his work as a writer). However, after seeing Cabin In The Woods a few weeks ago, I saw what Whedon was able to accomplish with what was, technically a film that goes into the horror genre, but really was one of the best and unique films I've seen in a long time. And even though he was only a script writer for Cabin, anyone who knows anything at all about screenplays knows that that was one that was penned by a very talented and creative guy. So at that point I was more than convinced that he could pull off something great with The Avengers, and after seeing it tonight, it's safe to say that Whedon was certainly quite up for this task. If you love movies then go see this one. It has the action, it has the acting, and more than anything (and is so important when it comes to a film like this) it has the story and script. This is the quintessential summer movie that everyone hopes for. But, and this is the good part, it's also got so much more that makes it so much more than the quintessential summer movie. So, the summer movie season has officially arrived. And now, the rest of the season has its work cut out for it.",NA

The first time I saw this, I pretty much didn't really see any of the other separate Marvel movies before this one. But I got to say, this is one rare movie that really focuses on and mixes great action, swift camera movements, and hilarious touches of humor in one package. For a movie that's well over two hours, there isn't very many slow scenes (except maybe some action sequences) and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick. All the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts. As with the other Marvel movies, it's always fun to spot Stan Lee. From the Avengers getting together to the battle in New York City, it was a fun journey while it lasted. All I got to say is that the Hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie. It is a swell film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",NA
"The Avengers","Robosk","21 August 2012","I have never reviewed anything here on IMDb but after watching the Avengers for the second time I just felt the need to say something. Very well, after watching the Avengers in the cinema you don't reflect very much of the bad things, it's all special effects and 3D stuff going on. But after watching this alone at home, I just felt it's not that good. The story is cliché as many has mentioned, but I felt that there are a few things that are unclear.I just can't figure out how strong are the asgardians, they are supposedly demi-gods. Still the hulk threw Loki around like nothing, I just felt that scene was unnecessary. I don't want the bad-guy to look so crappy. I just couldn't take Loki seriously he got tossed around a lot. Don't get me wrong I enjoy some of the humor added to this film, it's just sometimes it's not timed right it just seems wrong to me.The most annoying part about The Avengers is that the Bad Guys didn't stand a chance. And I didn't like Loki for being a bad guy again.",NA

I love the action, effects and humor of the film. Wow! Stan Lee and the whole Marvel team did an excellent job with the franchise. It's still great to this day and I have the entire Avengers DVD collection. Applause to the whole cast and crew.",NA

"The Avengers","Fifth_of_November","25 May 2012","First of all, I am a fan of superhero movies. But Marvel, with Iron Man 2 and now this monstrosity, is losing me.I had mixed expectations before seeing this movie, and I went out of it depressed about the state of the movie-making industry and more specifically, the fate of superhero stories.If that is the kind of scenario which deserves to be acclaimed from every corner, why should directors like Christopher Nolan keep working on adding depth and substance to their movies if immature and empty scenarios such as The Avengers can earn as much praise? I am clueless. OK there needs to be movies for teenagers and I am fine with that, but that does not mean it should be praised as much as The Godfather.The Avengers, really, can be summarized as two hours of four superheroes fighting each other over the location of some blue cube because Loki wanted it so, just like drunken guys in any tavern, and who finally come together to fight (again) in a huge alien battle on Manhattan against aliens who can't shoot straight, have fragile weaponry, and who are led by a demi-god, Loki, who ends up being simply beaten up by Hulk with his bare-hands, no questions asked, just as if Batman would destroy Superman because it makes for a funny ending.If anyone can add anything of substance to what I have just described, only with sarcasm I admit, I am willing to hear about it.This was a poor movie, and how well it was received by critics shows how big corporations like Disney now control the industry with propaganda in order to create mass hysteria. Independent thought is dead.",NA
"The Avengers","ramanarao1997","17 April 2015","The graphics of the movie are amazing.IT includes many awesome scenes such as fighting,immense action scenes transforming of tony stark and hulk other themes of the movie are the attitude of tony,huge star cast,action packed scenes and many more.on the whole you get the pleasure of watching a nice movie and the time just passes by when you watch this movie.but the starting of the movie is somewhat dragging.when the characters come into play one by one the movie gets interesting.it also has some comedy scenes.it is the first movie to have more than 3 marvel characters.if you are a lover of visual effects you must definitely watch this movie!!!!!!!!!",NA
"The Avengers","mcoyle-381-636753","27 May 2012","Did not live up to my expectations AT ALL. For a movie with such hype, it was very long and the picture was very dark. Too many overly dramatic lines, and the buildup music lasted for practically the whole movie. I usually love superhero movies, but this one was a letdown. I don't know why it got such great ratings. The Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, and Captain America movies were more enjoyable on their own. I thought it would be great to see all these heroes come together, but I think it really just lead to so many main characters that the audience didn't get a chance to understand any of them individually. Special effects were great, don't get me wrong, and the 3D was cool, but that wasn't enough to save the movie. Storyline was too stretched out. Underwhelming opening. The movie didn't evoke my emotions (I wasn't scared, sad, excited, relieved when I should have been). A bunch of characters that are interesting on their own plus special effects does not equal a great movie. Overall, I'm disappointed.",NA
"The Avengers","mikecart1","4 June 2013","Before I say everything that was wrong with the movie, I will first say that I am familiar with the comics and source material, and have thought all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies so far were decent. My personal favorite is Ironman 1, one of my favorite movies overall, because of the way it told the story and how it maintained more realism than the other movies in the franchise series of Marvel movies. Physics, engineering, and basic foundations of life were followed while telling the story of Tony Stark. Everything, while elaborate, seemed possible. Possible is the key word.I grew up watching Bill Bixby be the Incredible Hulk with Lou and thought the show was awesome. I do know, though, that technology wasn't around the make Hulk be what the comic wanted him to be. The Hulk movie therefore was decent but nothing I am dying to watch again. Captain America and Thor were decent too.So what was I expecting when I saw Avengers? I was expecting the 1992 Dream Team. I was expecting a movie that would be epic in every way where each character was maximized to their fullest while trying to solve a deep plot similar to The Watchmen or even the recent Dark Knight Trilogy. I got neither. The plot, in my opinion, was way too simplified and even worse, all the characters seemed to be more forgettable.I will say some of the casting was quite poor and didn't flow with the original intent of the characters and some were just annoying in their roles. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, in particular, were very unwatchable even though like Lost in Translation and The Hurt Locker.Overall, I can see how this movie made so much money. It is the perfect movie to take younger kids and comic book fans. It is actually even better for those that don't know the source material because they are coming into the movie fresh. However, this is no Dark Knight type of movie with the depth of plot, real-world story lines, or the perfect casting. I give it 7/10 and hope Avengers 2 is a lot better executed.",NA
"The Avengers","freemantle_uk","3 May 2012","Ever since Marvel Studios started turning its properties into films with the release of Iron Man in 2008, The Avengers was always going to be the endgame in one of the most ambitious blockbusters projects in recent times. Fans have been dying to know — is it worth the wait? In The Avengers, Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has set his sights on the conquest of Earth and makes an alliance with the alien race called the Chitauri to give him the army he needs. To bring the Chitauri to Earth, however, Loki needs the all-powerful Tesseract (AKA the Comic Cube). Breaking into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, Loki steals the Tesseract, which forces Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to reactivate the Avengers Initiative, uniting Earth's Mightiest Heroes: Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the recently defrosted Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the deadly accurate archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and deadly thighs super spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson). To stop this new threat, they must all use their physical and mental abilities — and work together.By allowing all the major characters their own films, we have presumably gotten to know them, so the film doesn't have to waste time with introductions and can jump straight into the action. In the first 10 minutes, Loki breaks into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility with plenty of gun fire, magic blasts and car chases. Although an early fight scene involving Black Widow was a bit weak, using too many quick cuts and close-ups, the rest of the action ranges from good to fantastic.There are three big action highlights: a three way fight between our heroes, a battle on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and the climactic Battle of the New York. They are all well-shot, perfectly edited sequences. Even though there is a lot going on, like the Helicarrier sequence in which many of the characters are fighting in different areas, it is still easy to follow thanks to the editing skill. The massive Battle of New York has a very similar feel to the Battle of Chicago in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but unlike Bay, Whedon knows the focus needs to be on the superheroes battling alien invaders.As you fantasised about, the Avengers are finally together and they all have great chemistry. Downey continues to show off his quick wit, but Tony Stark has finally found a intelligential equal in the form of Bruce Banner; both talk enough techno babble to put Star Trek to shame. Downey keeps a reckless side to Stark as he tries to taunt Banner into becoming the Hulk. Stark is distrustful, cocky and unwilling to work with others, but he learns, and when push comes to shove he becomes a team player who shows what a true hero is.Evans was an excellent Captain America, bringing out all the nobility, resourcefulness and willingness to step into danger that makes the character famous. He stills has his values, and despite being arguably the weakest of the main four, he's willing to stand his ground. When the Battle of New York starts, he shows his leadership skills as he helps civilians to safety. Despite the fact he should be adjusting to the modern world, he answers his call to duty.Ruffalo offers us the best performance yet as Bruce Banner, making him a stoic and reserved character, not the dower being he has been in the past. Banner is a brilliant scientist who is more agreeing of the Hulk. He offers some darkness as he reveals his past, but it does not linger as he tries to be good. As the Hulk, Ruffalo gets to kick alien butt and provide us with some great action set pieces, and he even provides a lot of comedy through this physical actions and expert comic timing.Thor does not go through any character growth, but that is because most of it happened in Thor (2011). It is simply a continuation of what happened previously, showing Thor has matured. Hemsworth continues with his grand performance as the Norse God and even has an odd joke.Tom Hiddleston continues to show he is a great and compelling villain. Hiddleston keeps Loki's oily charisma and the aura of mystery that his plans and actions are never clear until the last moment. He has a bigger thirst for power and he's more menacing and threatening: he kills a man in front of a group people just for purposes of an eye scan. Hiddleston offers a very theatrical performance and he more than holds his own with Jackson and Downey in his villainous delivery.Joss Whedon was an inspired choice to write and direct because of his knowledge and love for the source material. He was able to blend together the different elements seamlessly, whether it was sci-fi, technological, fantasy or espionage and makes sure all the previous films were recognized. The characters were balanced, no one is sidelined and everyone has a moment to shine in some form. The dialogue was witty with some keen observations such as Captain America not understanding a modern reference and other instances of humour in their general interactions when the action was not happening.The Avengers is a very entertaining film that continues Marvel's excellent track record in filmmaking. Despite the long running time, the film is never dull and only people with the biggest aversion to superhero films would dislike Marvel's latest adventure. This film has set the bar very high for this year's blockbuster season.As a final note, there is a post credits scene that happens in the middle of the credits, but word is that for the North American release, the ""extra scene"" rumored to have been filmed at the premiere runs at the very end. So, you'll want to stay in your seat til the very very end.Please visit www.playeraffinity.com",NA
"The Avengers","julie_x47","1 June 2012","I booked tickets for this as my boyfriend wanted to catch it before it left the cinemas, and from the trailer it looked like great fun, but after a very achy backside from sitting and squirming through 2 an half hours of this tripe, bored out of my brain, just wasn't worth it! The only good thing about this film was Downy Jr, hes an incredible actor in his own right, and if it wasn't for him I'd be giving it 0/10. Just cant understand why people are soooo hyped over it, very cliché, bad acting (apart from Jr) dialogue was atrocious, and the story has been done time and time before.. Yawn! I was expecting something sooo much more from this film and it fell flat.",NA
"The Avengers","Dan_L","28 May 2012","I really enjoyed Captain America, Thor, and the first Iron Man, but The Avengers is just a mostly boring, repetitive, excessively long mess of self-indulgence. You'd never know that the talented Joss Whedon directed -- the film has none of his trademark sly humor, cleverness or pacing.Instead we get a needlessly long film short on everything but action. While Mark Ruffalo is excellent as Bruce Banner / The Hulk, the rest of the cast is pretty much cardboard. Frankly, it's just a dumb film and just because it's popular does not mean it's a good film.So if you like lots of action, wooden dialog, dumb plots, and, well a lot of noise, you'll love this mess of a film. But if you expect to see a film that's better than the best episodes of Josh Whedon's ""Buffy"" or want more from a film, be prepared to be disappointed.",NA
"The Avengers","TOMNEL","16 July 2012","These Marvel comics obviously have a lot of fans, and apparently whatever it was that fans (and many non-fans) were looking for in a Marvel film was fulfilled here, explaining the huge internet buzz, the vast amounts of money this has made, and it's current spot in the top 50 films of all time on the Internet Movie Database. This movie does have expensive looking action, and some comedic bits with lots of superheroes, but what it's missing is...pretty much everything else. The plot is uninteresting and quite honestly stupid, and nothing really is driving this story along. At times, to me, it grew boring, because there was nothing to get excited about besides action, big stars and comedy.After Norse god Loki steals the powerful potential super weapon ""Tesseract"" from the peace keeping S.H.I.E.L.D. agency, and mind controls a few people, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) puts together a team of superheroes known as the Avengers, made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and eventually Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Loki is in cahoots with a group of aliens called the Chitauri, and plans to help them take over Earth. The Avengers must stop fighting with each other in order to protect the Earth...can they do it, or will the Earth be destroyed? (Take a guess).Director Joss Wheddon, known for his work on television series, does a fine job with the direction when it comes to action. The big action scenes are appropriately frenetic, and they look big and shiny. I appreciated that the action scenes were spaced apart from each other also, as to not overkill the action like the Transformers films. The fighting scenes between the Avengers was a bit overkill however. Half the movie is them disagreeing with each other, or Tony Stark being snarky with everyone. These scenes don't really have anything to them either. They aren't exciting. They are meant to be funny, but oftentimes comes off as more infantile in the humor department than anything else. They further the plot along, only in that the plot cannot proceed until these guys stop fighting. These scenes are supposed to work as character development, but it's almost unbelievable how stupid these guys are, and how unwilling they are to put their differences aside.The middle of the movie takes place on a ship, with the Avengers angry at each other, and this whole section of the movie just meanders. You could say that this part of the movie gives us the character conflicts and whatnot, which it does, but the Avengers' dislike of each other could have been introduced in something more important to the plot, instead of practically stopping the plot to have these guys get angry at each other. And that's really the movie's biggest problem is the plot. There's never really a feeling of dread, or that something bad could happen, and it's hard to care about anything that's happening. That's not to say watching Tony Stark bantering isn't amusing, or watching Bruce Banner go insane as the Hulk isn't interesting, but nothing ever truly feels at stake. When the film decides to kill off a character to add some level of emotion, and serve as a reason for these heroes to stop their childishness, it doesn't work on an emotional level. It comes off as a cheap way to further along the plot. The Avengers has some good elements to it. It's got a lot of charisma in the cast, and each character is given enough screen time I suppose. The action scenes are satisfying mostly, and some of the comedy isn't bad (while some does come off as a bit corny and pandering to the audience). The problem is the plot, where the villains never really come off as menacing, despite possessing a super weapon, and a main villain is Loki who is about as threatening as a teddy bear. There's nothing to the film, and nothing to really love about it, unless you are a big fan of these actors, the comics, or explosions. There's very little below the surface of the film, and without a good plot to move this along, we've essentially got one long Avengers origin story. Apparently many have fallen in love with this though, so if you like your movies big, dumb and full of buff dudes, you'll probably like this one quite a bit.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 140 mins. PG-13 for action violence.",NA
