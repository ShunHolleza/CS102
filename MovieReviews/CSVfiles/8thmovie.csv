"Spider-Man","jaredpahl","5 June 2016","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","

"Spider-Man","nickmesafilms","19 May 2012","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","

"Spider-Man","Smells_Like_Cheese","5 May 2002","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","

"Spider-Man","MaxBorg89","8 October 2005","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","

"Spider-Man","Doylenf","15 December 2002","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","

"Spider-Man","Hitchcoc","28 February 2006","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","

"Spider-Man","Aaron1375","2 September 2005","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","

"Spider-Man","MissCzarChasm","5 May 2002","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","

"Spider-Man","TxMike","1 November 2002","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","

"Spider-Man","Sleepin_Dragon","24 December 2022","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","

"Spider-Man","TheLittleSongbird","8 May 2009","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","

"Spider-Man","PedroPires90","18 December 2021","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","

"Spider-Man","generationofswine","16 November 2016","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","

"Spider-Man","clydestuff","9 April 2004","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","

"Spider-Man","Prismark10","25 November 2021","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man. He has to learn that with great powers come great responsibilities. He saves people as Spider-Man while Peter Parker gets a job with the Daily Bugle as a freelance photographer.Norman Osborn loses the grip in his company and so tries out one of his inventions. He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman. Peter Parker takes off his clothes while running just like Clark Kent. It is a nod that the modern superhero genre started with Richard Donner's Superman.","

"Spider-Man","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","2 June 2018","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","

It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","

"Spider-Man","joetufano719","19 June 2012","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","

"Spider-Man","to_kill_better","26 June 2002","Having seen the trailers for this film I have to say that I didn't walk into the cinema with high hopes. The computer effects looked badly integrated, the Green Goblin's costume looked awful and comic book adaptations usually have such painful scripting and plotting. Thankfully I was wrong on most counts (The Goblin still looks rubbish).As it turns out, this is probably the best super-hero film I've yet seen - certainly up there with Superman and Batman. People seem to automatically comment that the script and acting was bad because they expect it to be the case in these films; and indeed it usually is. But if you go into Spider-man without this prejudicial attitude you'll be pleasently suprised. The acting is generally great - there is never a time when anyone is not believable as their character and you think ""Hey, that's an actor, not Peter Parker"". The effects do look artificial but the pace of the movie means you don't have time to dwell on this and the script is fine! What do people want, Shakespearian soliloquies? That would sound incredibly out-of-place in modern day New York. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like ""friendly neighbourhood spider-man"" are fully in-keeping with the character.
The comic turns from J.J. Jameson hit the mark, the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evil-looking (and the conversation with his mirror-image was a great touch). My only gripe was with the Green Goblin's costume. Very monotone green and not very scary.All-in-all a great film that I wouldn't hesitate for a second in recommending.","

"Spider-Man","MissCzarChasm","4 May 2002","It's Finally here folks. Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man has hit the big screen. The hysteria surrounding this movie is out of this world. I saw the last showing of it with my friends because every other showing was sold out and the showing i saw was packed and filled with Spidey fans and excited movie goers alike.*POTENTIAL SPOILER* I just read this morning that Spider-Man achieved the highest opening day of all time with 41.5 million and is set to make about 100-120 million opening weekend which would make it surpass Harry Potter as the highest opening weekend of all time. *END SPOILER*. There is no doubt in my mind that this film deserves the praise it got from critics and from the reaction in my theatre this film is headed for the record books.Spider-Man is a comic book movie with heart. Yes i enjoyed Blade, another marvel adaptation, and I even enjoyed its sequel. I happened to like X-Men as well. But the one thing those movies lacked was a grounded hero which was given a firm backstory. While certain things were glanced over in those films, this picture takes time to develop its characters and by the time we reach the 45 minute mark we care about all their fates. There is a nice family storyline with Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Peter Parker. There is romance with the Peter Parker/Mary Jane relationship, and there are also family struggles with the Norman/Harry Relationship. The story takes time to develop these stories and you can since that when this script was written it was done with a lot of heart and someone who cared about making us care about the characters and their struggles.One must talk about Tobey Maguire. I was disappointed when i first heard he got the part. I didn't think he could be tough enough considering his other starring roles. I was pleasantly surprised however when i saw his performance. He brings the comic book character to life in the best way. He induces the character with enough vulnerability in the beginning when he's a nerd that we care for him, but when he discovers he has powers Maguire easily shifts into someone more confident. He balances both personna's well, without falling out of character. Considering that we can't see his face at all when the mask is on, the fact that he still can give a masked character some heart is amazing in my bookKirsten Dunst isn't just there for eye candy, as the trailer would suggest. Sure, there are several shots of her that plenty of males will enjoy but she also brings her character from the comic book into the real world. Her chemistry with Tobey Maguire is not forced but very natural. There are certain moments when she falls into total damsel in distress mode but over-all it's a pretty grounded performance.James Franco makes for a very good Harry Osborn. He brings the character's struggles from the comic book and right onto the screen. We respect him because he's Parker's only friend but at the same time he makes you feel for him because he could end up as his father. Franco is able to this well and is very impressive in a few emotional scenes.Every comic book movie needs a good villian. Batman had the joker. X-men had Magneto and the Brotherhood of Evil Muntants. Spider-Man's greatest foe in the comic was none other than the Green Goblin. He gave Spider-Man the most conflict in the comic book because of the secret that he knew about Spider-Man and the secret that Spider-Man would eventually learn about him. It was very important that they not ruin this character because he's such an important villian in the Spider-Man mythology.I'm proud to say that Willem Dafoe is quite good as both Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He makes his Norman likable yet flawed in the beginning but once he turns into the Green Goblin, that's when the fun starts. His performances is borderline over the top but since it never crosses the line he makes the villian much more threatening. You can tell he had fun with the part and while he doesn't quite reach the level of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, he's right up there as one of the better comic book movie villians. What i also enjoyed was the fact that the villian never over-shadowed the hero. This is where Batman made its mistake. Jack Nicholson stole the show, but since Dafoe doesn't get as much screentime as Tobey Maguire, he doesn't steal show. I'm glad the filmmakers chose to do this.The CGI is a wonder to look at it. You will believe that a man can stick to roles and soar over the city with grace. It's like a comic book come to life. There are some shots that look pretty unrealistic but when you think about it i think they were going for that in a couple of shots. It feels more like comic book when you see certain shots like that. Besides it would be very difficult to make this believeable with the use of a lot of CGI. The characters never lose their depth when they're in costume and the voice over work done when it's obviously not a man but a special effect is quite good as well. The actors deserves major kudos for making their characters believeable, even when it's a CGI shot.Sam Raimi is a gifted director. From genre films like the Evil Dead series, to compelling films such as A Simple Plan and The Gift, his work never ceases to amaze me. He handles the material well and you can tell he followed the comic book closely. He makes Spider-Man move much like he does in the comic book and he makes sure that there is more time spent on developing an actual story than giving us a lot of action. There is plenty of action, don't get me wrong but the story in my opinion is it's greatest highlight because you can almost identify with all of the characters. This credit should go to screenwriter, David Koepp, who also did well with the Panic Room script. Raimi does offer some campy touches. The wrestling match features a cameo with Bruce Campbell as the announcer, you may remember him as Ash from the Evil Dead movies, The towns reaction to Spider-Man is very campy and cheesy but is handled well. You can tell Raimi really had fun with the material. The J Jonah Jameson character is another example. Out of most of the supporting characters he looks more like his comic book character. The performance is doen pretty well and he does offer us some nice campy laughs.Spider-Man is more than a summer movie. Most summer movies supply you with much action but a little of everything else. This movie has it all. Action, romance, and a little heart too. The film leaves it wide open for a sequel and by the end of it i couldn't wait to go on another adventure with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN!","

"Spider-Man","zoran_kamen","18 June 2016","I truly don't know what to say about this movie, which got already all possible praises and all possible critics ! But I will write what I canfrom my heart, cause my post cannot match any reviews from grammaticalsuper humans and ultra intelligent movie critics ! OK lets start : This movie is directed by one of my favorite film directors Sam Raimi who directed and produced so many good movies and one I love the most is TV series adaptation of Evil Dead (also directed by him) movie, Ash vs Evil Dead which also have mostly positive reviews by top critics. I think ratings go well over 90% on rotten tomatoes ! Spider-Man is supremely made from beginning till end. Every scene is so fresh, playful, innocent and there is no second of boredom in this one ! I think its the best movie of all movies about Spider- Man and they surely knew why Sam Raimi would be perfect man for directing it ! Special effects are just right amount and they don't look artificial at all ! You really have feeling like being part of this world of super heroes and super villains ! So if you wanna movie to look good give it to Spielberg, Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi ! In all three cases you cannot miss ! Acting could be flawed but movie will look good ! Cause I really love movies about super heroes, with Superman first part being one of my favorite movies ever, but I love also Batman and actually all marvel produced world of super heroes, including X-men franchise (Nine movies until 2016, Deadpool is really great, as well as all others, yup I like also those three banned by critics) Why I wrote this review in 2016 if movie was made 2002 ? I always loved this movie,I guess I would like to support its ratings to go for tiny bit higher ! So for me everything is perfect in this movie - acting, effects, story, scenery for me all this is 10/10 ! On of rare movies I can say that without least doubt ! Just one more thing- 3rd part of Spider Man from 2007(also directed by Sam Raimi) was little bit over criticized by movie critics ! I know they know what to write, they are not stupid of course, but still maybe we became little to spoiled by both mega successful and genius parts before that one (2002 and 2004) cause they said ; in this 3rd part problem is there is too much of everything, but I think Sam Raimi just wanted to conclude franchise with spectacular finish, so in my eyes it was unjustly rated and my rate for all three parts is 10/10 without any doubt ! Thank You Sam for so many excellent movies and to make our life more fun !!","

Tobey Maguire played the shy, wishy-washy, Charlie Brown-like character in other important movies such as The Cider House Rules and Pleasantville and yet in all these movies he's also wise. He's the ideal next door guy , the next door superhero. I praise the performance of the other actors of this great movie of course.","

"Spider-Man","Ch4ndler_B1ng","7 January 2022","This is the OG Spider-Man movie, it has one of the greatest comic book villain performances of all time by Willem Dafoe and Tobey Maguire gives an extremely likeable portrayal of Peter Parker and Spider-Man, the face off between Green Goblin and Spidey towards the end of the film is intense and incredibly filmed, it's also the only Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie where Mary Jane isn't exceedingly whiny, annoying and just plain dislikeable. Uncle Ben's death is extremely moving and emotional, you're guaranteed to cry, his death encourages and inspires Peter Parker to become Spider Man.These three films have become memes, but the first Spider-Man movie was the start of it all, it's a classic in the superhero genre. The Green Goblin's outfit is a bit cheesy and power-ranger-y looking, some action scenes look a little unrealistic and the scene where Peter Parker is flying without his suit looks awful, but these are minor problems. And that flying scene at the end of the movie... goosebumps, amazing! It was the start of an amazing trilogy and if you disagree... ""I missed the part where that's problem.""","

"Spider-Man","classicsoncall","13 August 2011","My summary line above came from Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), spoken from her hospital bed to nephew Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) at her side. It was a great line and a cleverly playful shot at DC Comics, who haven't had as much success in adapting their super-heroes to the big screen the way Marvel Comics has. Back in 2002, this one was the 'make or break' film that would propel Marvel into future projects if it was successful, and history bears out the results. I saw the picture when it came out, but wasn't writing these reviews back then, so I'm a little late to the party. But I have to say, watching it again some nine years later leaves me with some of the same feelings I had back then. I thought the condensed story of Spider-Man's origin was neatly done, along with the way Peter gradually learned to use his new found powers. By the time Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) has his heart to heart talk with Peter and advises - ""Just be careful who you change into"" - we're already in on Peter's amazing secret with a sense that big things are ahead for the teen-age hero.One of the great kicks I get out of watching the Marvel franchise films is waiting to catch comic book writer and legend Stan Lee in one of his now ubiquitous appearances. Lee is seen in this one during the Green Goblin's attack on the Unity Day Festival when he pulls a young girl away from some falling debris. I was surprised today to see how quick that scene played out, so if you're not attentive you're bound to miss it. I see that Lee's appearance in the picture is uncredited as the 'Man in Fair', but a better clue to help pick him out would be 'Man who saves girl', but as I say, it was a pretty quick scene.The other great memory I had while watching the picture again today was the appearance of Randy 'Macho Man' Savage portraying the wrestler Bone Saw McGraw. Savage, who along with Ric Flair, was one of those pro wrestling villains that had a way of attracting a fan base because of his cool style. He displays his classic finishing move, the flying elbow drop off the top ropes on a hapless opponent before Peter enters the ring as the Human Spider. I was saddened to learn of his untimely and tragic death earlier this year, as he was a colorful character in his own right, and seemed to finally have found some measure of peace in his hectic life.Aside from the reminiscences, the picture itself is a nice balance of character development for the principal players, and action scenes involving Spider-Man and his chief nemesis, Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). I have to admit, the Goblin get-up seemed cheesy to me, looking like a static green robot, especially when the eye-guards were in place. But hey, it's over and done with, so no sense quibbling now.So overall, I thought this was a pretty good and entertaining kick start to the Marvel Universe in cinema, and certainly for your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Subsequent pictures would reinforce the idea that with great power comes great responsibility, a line that has come to epitomize the super-hero genre.","

"Spider-Man","Sean_Thorniley","1 May 2002","Poignant, fun and a  faithful adaptation to the original comic book.  I am very critical of comic book movies since I am a huge fan of the medium and was tremendously disappointed in the Superman and Batman movies (all of them, some greatly!). This film however has again demonstrated that an adaptation of a comic book story can be  fun and faithful to the story, yet be a film for all ages and those who may not have ever even read a comic book.  The Crow was the only other good comic book movie in my opinion, but it was not an all ages fun ride as this is!I had the privilege of seeing the film last night, 4-30-02, in SF with the press and 300+ other folks for its ""Bay Area Premiere"".The acting is the finest portion of the film with the leads giving us depth that I was unsure would be allowed by the style of story chosen.  Maguire was outstanding at being a guy who can rarely catch a break, but attract difficulty with ease and aplomb.  He is awkward with the woman he loves, but eloquent when dealing with the familiar, just as most teenagers are even today.  He gave us wonderful joy at the prospect of ""web swinging"" and kicking some much deserved ass!  Dafoe is wonderfully scary as the man who has succumbed to the power games of the corporate  world that drives a decent man mad striving for perfection in himself while trying to hard to please all the wrong people to no avail and then being consumed by guilt that has built over the years of family neglect which finally helps to push him over the edge when an opportunity to make a huge mistake presents itself.The rest of cast is nearly as spectacular with the J.K. Simmons turning in the best performance in the film as J. Jonah Jamason.  When he appeared on screen things lite up even more and he was on fire making everyone in the audience laugh and myself nearly p** my pants.  Harris as Aunt May and Robertson as Uncle Ben were excellent choices and gave the film a great deal of its credibility and finesse.  Letting what happens to Ben and Peter (I am not telling) was wonderful and the best punctuation to what makes Peter do what he does and brings complete credibility to the story.   I am not a huge Dunst fan, but she was just fine as the love of Peter Parker's life and a person much like Peter only neither was conscious of the fact.  This to me is a more real version of  ""true love"".The script was far stronger than I expected with some wonderful dialog; verbal exchanges, solid plot points and pacing.  Many a good parenting lesson can be found in this film as well as interesting thoughts about the choices that we make in life that we might think are no big deal when in the heat of passion, but may well come back to haunt us if we don't think before we act/speak: which is the trust of the film in my humble opinion.The direction from Raimi was also much better than I anticipated coming from someone who is known (and loved) for his over the top camp and action.  Many of the fight and action sequences where more ""over done"" than I like, but they were solid and much like a comic of the Silver Age from whence the story comes so it fit the film fine.  Nice cinematography without the CGI taking over and detracting from the realism, in fact it made much of the web swinging truly believable.  A few points made things a bit hard to ""believe"", but over all I think most folks will be able to suspend their disbelief.Danny Elfman.  Need I say more?  He is the man when it comes to ""super hero"" music and is the closest thing to John Willams and the late great Bernard Herman there is today.  He subtly sets the mood and most of the audience probably doesn't even realize it.  Tomorrow is my day off and I will be purchasing the score to add to my collection!","

"Spider-Man","abstractthinker","27 April 2002","I saw this movie last night at a preview, and I must say I was impressed. The acting of all the cast was good, especially William Dafoe. I must admit that I wans't quite sure about Tobey Maguire as Peter Paker, but after watching it, I cannot think of anyone who would be better suited to the role.The only places where it changes the orginal comicbook story are when the comicbook is not very believable. So these changes don't harm the story in anyway, but might even make it better.On the whole, I would have to say this movie is definately worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of the comic/cartoon series or just a general comic fan.","

"Spider-Man","Bubba32618","18 December 2021","I love Spider-Man, the character means quite a lot to me. I have seen this film a million times but I still love it. It looks a little dated which is sad to say but still I love it and this franchise has one of the only sequels I would say is better than the original. Tobey Maguire is the best Spider-Man I think, he is such a good Peter Parker and he is a really good Spider-Man too. I do think this movie came out at the perfect time, it shows New York in a positive light with the New Yorkers helping Spider-Man, right after maybe the most tragic event ever, that happened right in New York. Willem Dafoe is very good in this film as Norman Osbourne and the Green Goblin. The way the two characters interact, because they are two characters essentially, is just really well done. Aunt May and Uncle Ben are great. Tibet's acting is pretty good. The relationship between Peter and MJ is really good and it just gets better the farther we go into these movies. James Franco is pretty good as Harry Osbourne but I think he is probably the best as Harry in Spider-Man 3. This movie has started to age a bit but I will still always love it, Spider-Man is just such a good film.","

Next to the X-Men movies that came out about the same time, and Superman with Christopher Reeve, it is definitely one of the better Comic to Movie films put out.The cast is well chosen. McGuire is Spiderman/Peter Parker to me. I don't think they could have chosen better. Kirsten Dunst makes a decent Mary Jane Watson, wasn't ever fond of her to begin with, but it's pulled off well. Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin is sheer genius. The story is well written and keeps you along for the entire ride, coupled with action that's explosive and thrilling. Definitely fun for all, even die hard Spidey fans won't be disappointed! Fun for all! 9/10.","

"Spider-Man","meydiana-65242","20 November 2020","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","

One of the best origin stories that like an old wine, keeps getting better because it is laden with story, a soul that only gets more enlightened by CGI. Sam Raimi researched the material well and it shows, be it having some inside jokes, Easter eggs and how he got the hero got name. The first 30 minutes is simply the best ""origin of origin"", a superhero flick has shown till date. Best thing is he got so much comfortable with it that he made even amazing second part (one of the best sequels till date) (tied up with T2) but still nothing beats an origin story because it shows ""Even you can be"".","

"Spider-Man","Aly200","21 January 2017","Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" have started getting audiences excited for the modern superhero movies, but when Sam Raimi released his first ""Spider Man"" outing the expectations bar immediately shot to the stratosphere. Raimi delivered on his promise of an exciting and action-packed film about Marvel Comic's famous web-slinging superhero. We are given the basic origin story of how teenage Peter Parker gains his famous powers after a radioactive spider bites him, but we are treated to an engaging narrative as the newly minted hero must contend with his most deadly adversary in the wicked Green Goblin while also contending with normal teenage drama such as an at-times contentious friendship as well as harboring feelings for his pretty neighbor. Stepping into the web-slinger's famous costume is the well cast Tobey Maguire who deftly manages to play both the nerdy Peter Parker and courageous Spider Man with equal flair. Despite being nearly thirty years old at the time of filming, Maguire's youthful appearance convinces the audience that he resembles a teenager and not a mature young man. Even when inhabiting Spidey's famous suit, Maguire displays a youthful machismo mixed with some naivety as Peter is still coming into his element as a superhero but proves himself as fearless when confronted by his emerald-clad nemesis, the Green Goblin. While other more seasoned young actors were considered, the gamble to go with Maguire paid handsomely as he carries the weight of both average New York teen and crime-fighting legend in harmonious tandem.On the opposite side of the board playing the villainous Green Goblin and his unstable alter ego, Norman Osbourne, is the wickedly delightful Willem Dafoe in one of his most insane roles. When the film starts and Norman is running his successful company, Dafoe portrays a fatherly wisdom for young actors Tobey Maguire as Peter and James Franco who plays Norman's son, Harry, but also shows early signs of the soon-to-be shattered psyche that will doom Norman to the corruptible power of the Goblin persona (the result of a lab accident where Norman tests a power-enhancing drug on himself and kills a fellow scientist in his mania). Once the transformation into an unstable madman begins to take effect, Dafoe fully embraces the insanity and goes as over the top as possible, utilizing his vocal talents by using a lighter vocal tone for the tormented Norman while using his trademark gravelly sounding voice and a cackling demented laugh for the wicked Goblin, without becoming a cartoonish impression of the famous super-villain but as a calculating and dangerous adversary who strikes fear into everyone around New York. Added to the excitement of watching the actor in action is that instead of having a stuntman do the brunt work of maneuvering the Goblin's glider and engaging in fisticuffs with Spider Man is that Willem Dafoe performs his own stunts (the actor himself stated the fact in numerous interviews and the filmmakers backed Dafoe's statements). A talented supporting cast rounds out the compelling characters with Kirsten Dunst as Peter Parker's longtime neighbor and love interest, Mary Jane Watson, James Franco as Peter's best friend< Harry Osbourne who happens to be the son of his mortal enemy, Rosemary Harris as Peter's beloved Aunt May and cliff Robertson in the role of Uncle Ben (who sadly doesn't make it to the halfway mark of the film as comic book fans know well) and in a scene- stealing role as hot-headed and grouchy boss of the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson, is J.K. Simmons in what is one of the character actor's most iconic roles. The film's action sequences are well choreographed and executed from Peter Parker's first attempts to use his enhanced spider-like abilities to the infamous introduction of the Green Goblin at an Oscorp party to the dynamic final confrontation between Spidey and his emerald nemesis where the fists fly and ass-kicking just draws the attention in and doesn't relent till a victor is declared. The filmmakers use as little CGI as possible except for Spider Man's web-slinging across the city since director Sam Raimi is known for using practical effects in his films. The narrative of the film as mentioned before sets up the main action with the origin of Spider Man when Peter is bitten by the radioactive spider on a field trip with his class and we are given Green Goblin's origin as well with Norman Osbourne's ill-advised test of his company's drug on himself that causes him to become the demented villain we love to hate. The story then shifts into the main plot of how Spider Man comes to learn what he must do as a hero to protect his beloved city and loved ones.A truly masterful superhero film that really ushered in the modern superhero craze.","

"Spider-Man","matitya-33937","30 August 2022","There is a grand total of one negative thing I can say about this movie and it's that the effects haven't aged well. Aside from that all of it's amazing.First off, I don't care about the fact that in the early scenes teenagers are played by grown adults, it's a common cinematic trope and honestly just a nitpick. And I'm willing to defend the biological web shooters on the grounds that a genetically engineered super-spider with the abilities of all known spiders biting Peter Parker and transmitting its powers to him through its venom should lead to him getting the ability to shoot webs rather than him having to build a machine.Now that I've gotten that out of the way. This is a great movie. Maguire does an excellent job playing Peter Parker as a bullied nerd who to some degree or another retains his social outcast status after leaving school but manages to be comfortable with himself while being Spider-Man. (Speaking of which, Peter besting Flash Thompson was a cathartic scene as it shows Peter finally fight back after being forced into a corner and delivering Flash comeuppance). Cliff Robertson does a good job acting as a wise and kind mentor figure to Peter and his murder rising from Peter's from Peter's indifference worked extremely well as a tearjerker and it rendered it possible for me to buy this as the tragedy that motivated Peter to become Spider-Man.And I love the dual character arcs of Peter Parker/Spider-Man as he goes from saying ""so stop pretending to be"" when Uncle Ben says ""I know I'm not your father"" to saying ""I had a father his name was Ben Parker"" and how he goes from being the person who says ""I missed the part where that was my problem"" to someone who says ""With great power comes great responsibility"" to the point where he rejects Mary Jane Watson for her own safety at the end of the movie even though before then his entire goal was to win her over since the beginning of the film to the point where we are able to see that he really intends to fulfill this promise even though it pains him to do so. (Unlike in The Amazing Spider-Man wherein he clearly has no intentions of fulfilling his promise at all.)I like the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde dynamic of Dr. Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin and how it makes him sympathetic without him ceasing to be a threat. Proof that you can have tridimensional villains and well-developed heroes in the same film.I liked Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson and James Franco's Harry Osborn. And how the movie manages to set the stage for a potential sequel without sacrificing a self-contained storyline.I'm going to stop here since otherwise I'll just continue raving about it non-stop. The takeaway from this is it's a really good movie.","

"Spider-Man","kosmasp","21 July 2009","I know that many regard Spider Man 2 as the best Spider Man movie to date (part 4 and 5 are on it's way, but not here yet). For me personally, Spider man does the job. It's a fun (even quite a few times dark) intro into the world of Spider Man. Tobey Maguire seems so perfect in his role, it would be a shame, if someone would replace him for future installments (even though in part 3, he seemed like a mess, I do think it was the script that let him down on that one).Of course we are talking Spider Man here and not Batman, so the Origin story is lighter and more teen/kids friendly. But having Sam Raimi at the helm of the movie, it still crosses some small boundaries. The story, the character arc, the beginning, the villain ... everything fits together. It's simple, it's fun ... and it even has Bruce Campbell in it! ;o)","

"Spider-Man","mcugot","5 September 2022","Classic! It's a simple origin story that leads into a rivalry between Peter Parker/ Spider-Man and one of his most iconic foes the Green Goblin. The movie gets more intense as it goes on while also being a 50/50 spilt with Peter Parker's personal life. Very easy to follow. If you want to keep your kid busy for two hours, put this on for them, but you'll probably be just as engaged as they will be. The theme is also very recognizable. What makes Spider-Man so great is that he learns responsibility after many mistakes, which makes him relatable. The acting is great while the dialogue is cheesy, but that's what you'll get out of any early 2000 comic book movie. The cinematography is great too, but you'll probably see it improved in the 2nd and 3rd movie, at least in my opinion. It's fast paced and great and iconic scenes just keep coming one after another. The effects look good for its time but nothing mind blowing. Great sound and the score is iconic and one of the best themes for a superhero. Sam Raimi knew how to do Spider-Man right and this movie is truly one of its kind. 10/10. A+.","

And the part when he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider,which is the part we just cannot relate to, but wish it would happen to us.It's an original which cannot be replaced even by spider-man 2 and spider-man 3.I cannot stop recommending this movie so much because you don't really have to watch the other Marvel movies to truly understand it.","

"Spider-Man","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","17 September 2016","It's hard to believe it's been so long since director Sam Raimi reintroduced the beloved character of Spider-Man to film-goers with one of 2002's biggest releases. It truly was a magical time, and ""Spider- Man"" was very much to thank for this. Critically lauded and adored by the public, it was not only the first film to gross over $100 million in its opening weekend, but it was also the next big step in comic- book adaptations, ushering the public closer to understanding just how important comic books were and how much potential there was to make high-quality films inspired by these modern day myths. Films like ""Blade"" and ""X-Men"" were for sure the important first steps towards this, but it was ""Spider-Man"" that delivered on this promise, with its impact still being felt to this very day thanks to the rise of franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Yes, it is hard to believe how long it's been. Heck, the movie itself would now be old enough to be in High School just like Peter were it a person.Peter Parker (Tobey Macguire) is a nerdy high school student pining after his crush Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and dodging bullies with his best friend Harry. (James Franco) However, a school trip leads Parker towards a new and heroic life when a genetically-engineered ""Super-Spider"" bites him, granting him superhuman abilities. After the tragic death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), Peter chooses to use these abilities to protect the innocent, becoming the super-hero ""Spider-Man."" However, when Harry's father Norman Osbourne (Willem Dafoe) is similarly gifted superhuman abilities in a tragic accident and becomes the dreaded supervillain ""Green Goblin"", Peter will be torn as he will be forced to combat not only the father of his best friend, but a man he has come to greatly respect.Part of the great appeal is the lush and exquisite style injected into it thanks to the playful and thoughtful direction courtesy Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp's strangely old- fashioned yet appealing writing. The duo form a perfect union to tell the tale. Raimi- at the time best known as director of low-budget horror/comedies like the wonderful ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and quirky studio projects like ""A Simple Plan""- has a unique visual voice that lent itself well to the character. Himself a fan of Spidey's earlier comic-book adventures, Raimi is perhaps one of the few directors who was truly able to paint a film that felt like a comic come to life. With his wild and exotic camera-work, a fantastic sense of scope and color, and a sense of quirky ""fun"", it's just a wonder to behold, with such a magical and whimsical feel.Koepp's script is also a great deal of fun. As I said, it has an almost old-fashioned tone. It almost feels more akin to classics like Donner's ""Superman"" or Burton's ""Batman"" in terms of structure and dialog, with everything just slightly ""off"" of feeling modern, but in an appealing way. It gives the film a sense of timelessness. It doesn't feel a product of its time... it feels like the sort of film that could have been made at any time- the 70's, 80's, 90's... even now. And it's a big part of what helps maintain the film's freshness. As much as I enjoyed the 2012 reboot, it very much was the product of its time, and I find it feels more dated than this take on the character despite being much younger a film.The cast is phenomenal, and are also a major contributor to its high quality. For many, Maguire defined the character. He nails just the right tone as Peter Parker, playing him as the sort-of archetypal underdog you can't help but root for thanks to his kind heart and depth of character. He also made for a great web-slinger, though I will admit the humor and banter was lacking. Dunst is just a lovable female lead, even when the film doesn't go out of its way to give her much development or depth. (Though this film is very much Peter's tale, so I can forgive a somewhat clichÃ© love interest.) Franco is a ton of fun and the seeds are planted for the future development of the character. Dafoe is just wonderful, nailing the perfect balance between flawed but good- natured father-figure and scenery-chewing madman from scene to scene. Robertson is a joy as Uncle Ben. And supporting roles like the fabulous Rosemary Harris as Aunt May are fantastic.Compounding this is an absolutely magnificent score by Danny Elfman. A legend in the field, Elfman's themes help to accentuate the visuals and lend a sense of grandiose to the proceedings. It nails the right sound of just borderline melodrama mixed with grand old majestic heroics. To this day, the opening titles still give me chills, and I still associate any depiction of Spider-Man with his themes in my mind.All of this praise being said, I can't help but admit the film has some flaws, which is where it does lose a point for me. Despite his structuring and sensibilities being great fun, Koepp's dialog is... a little too out-there. A little too manufactured, even for the quirky tone he and Raimi are going for. Some pacing problems are apparent, particularly in the first and third acts, leading to speed-up's and slow-down's that can be jarring. And even for the time, some of the effects were... sub- par. (It wasn't until about the third film that the CGI used on Spider- Man looked totally realistic.)""Spider-Man"" to this day stands among the most important superhero movies of all time. And this is thanks not only to the records it broke, or to the paths it paved for future films... but also very much for its quality and grand sense of entertainment.And it is most certainly worth a near-perfect 9 out of 10.","

"Spider-Man","sdjones-1","2 May 2002","I thoroughly enjoyed ""Spider-Man,"" which I saw in a screening. I thought the movie was very engrossing.  Director Sam Raimi kept the action quotient high, but also emphasized the human element of the story.  Tobey Maguire was very believable as the gawky teenager in the early part of the film and then, after his run-in with the radioactive, genetically engineered spider, as the athletic, acrobatic superhero of the title. His boyish glee at discovering his new superpowers was infectious and got a lot of laughs.  I also didn't mind the changes to the ""Peter Parker: The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book story that the film's writers made, e.g., having Spider-Man's web come out of glands in his wrists rather than being an invention of Peter Parker's.  Especially good were Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben Parker, Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin, James Franco as Harry Osborn, and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  And in a small but memorable role, J.K. Simmons (""Oz,"" Law & Order"") as newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious.  Perfect casting. I also thought the special effects were very good.  Although I could easily tell when Spidey was a computer-generated image (or a stunt double for that matter), it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. However, I saw the movie with a six-year-old, who found the villainous Green Goblin -- superbly personified by Willem Dafoe -- very, very frightening, so I would advise against taking children younger than 10 years of age to this movie. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book was a childhood favorite of mine, and I can honestly say that Sam Raimi has done it justice!  I'm going to go see this movie again (sans terrified six-year-old).","

"Spider-Man","Movie-ManDan","22 October 2014","Before Spiderman, there wasn't very many superhero movies. Most of them sucked. After Spiderman's release in 2002 and its sequels in 2004 and 2007, we saw the Dark Knight movies, Thor, Captain American, Iron Man, etc. Without this movie, many people in these superhero films would not have careers.Unlike the cartoons and comics, this is slightly different version of Spiderman with a different story. Why did they change? Dramatic purposes were needed. See the 2012 reboot to see why. A nerdy Peter Parker gets bitten by a spider at a high school science field trip and develops radical powers. Although still timid and soft-spoken, he gains confidence and tries to win over Mary Jane Watson: his life-long crush. Meanwhile, Norman Osborne's most recent Oscorp experiment goes drastically wrong and develops a vicious alter-ego--the Green Goblin--who Peter must stop.Anybody that says the 2012 reboot beats this either thinks Andrew Garfield is hot and/or are hardcore comic fans that don't understand how movies work. Tobey's Peter Parker is kind, caring likable, hardworking and mysterious that can't seem to catch a break. Mary Jane is sweet, has high hopes, is popular, and comes from a bad home. Norman Osborne is emotionally- destructive and tortured by his other personality, Green Goblin. This Green Goblin is freaking scary, yet funny villain that hasn't yet been topped. (Well, Heath Ledger did.) The Love story is original and better than the new one. In this, Peter keeps himself a mystery from Mary Jane, yet is still her emotional comfort who is always there. The new one is just him getting the girl right away and developing ""chemistry."" The hero doesn't get the girl in this? That is originality. This movie is also very unforgettable.Tobey is so much better than Garf-cat. For one, he doesn't have a stupid haircut. For another, he is smart, but the whole movie isn't just Peter doing science experiments and trying to find out about his parents. Peter is also more muscular and looks like a superhero type, while Garfield is just skin and bones. Peter is developed so well in this, we feel his exact moods. Garfield's weren't bad, but not good. Tobey wasn't disrespectful to anybody like Garfield was throughout the whole movie. Tobey was more deserving of his powers. Tobey's Spider powers being internal makes him more of a superhuman. Garfield's discovery of his powers were so stupid. Garfield wined a lot more than Tobey did. This Peter was constantly changing throughout the whole movie, Garfield stayed the same. Tobey pulled off the geek persona while Garfield failed at a geek trying to be cool. Tobey's Spiderman delivers funny one-liners while fighting villains while Garfield breaks out into extremely stupid 10 minute songs and dances. Garfield gives up hunting his uncle's killer. Garfield only saved, what, 2 people? And caused that death of Gwen's father. Tobey saved many people throughout the whole movie and causes no deaths. Sorry for so many comparisons. It's a dirty job, but somebody had to do it!4/4","

"Spider-Man","Puroo","6 April 2021","As someone who has read the original comics, I can very much see what all changes have been brought in this movie from the source material. And they have done it absolutely correctly. It seems better to see Peter Parker as someone who chooses to use his proto suit to fight in a cage match than to see him as a celebrity. The scene of Uncle Ben being shot down by a thug was really emotional to see, as he left the message for Peter - ""With great power comes great responsibility"".Peter is left to choose his own destiny as a high school teenager who has to deal with a death in the family, his career after school and being a new hope of humanity. At many points throughout the movie I felt that if I were him I would have been completely broken. But that's exactly what makes him a hero. He deals with all the situations and makes it look so simple.I even feel bad for Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin. He had worked so hard on his project but finally it was suspended. He was struck with grief and then the next moment he's the iconic Spider-Man villain. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin looked way better than the comic counterpart. And his motivations were exactly like how we'd expect Green Goblin to be like.Spider-Man is one of those movies I often come back to see from time to time. I really like how the very first Spider-Man movie has set a benchmark for the future movies. It looks absolutely natural and has pretty good CGI for its time. The visual tone and colour palette are absolutely like an early 2000s film. It's a must watch movie for anyone starting to see Hollywood movies.","

"Spider-Man","NestorTheGreat","15 April 2022","Tobey's more vulnerable superheroe, love story. It's all about M. J.!This is all Sam Reimi - comic book fan boy version. As true to source as you could wish.The matrix-esque trapese-ballet swinging, spinning and spidery-thingies achieved in rudimentary CGI highlights how far ahead they were, and in comparison to today's, how very far they've come! And, surprisingly, its pixelations do not detract from the love-triangle story!Will she or won't she? Does money trump hearts? Will she see through the facade? The heartbreaks central to developing the selfless character we all know and want to see are very well fleshed out throughout this quest to find true love. That resignation and rejection are part and parcel of the journey our hero must face to overcome his flaws is very The Oddessey by way of LOTR deep, if you follow the hero quest lore.Seeing the result of Peter Parker's hard choices and harder work, is as wonderful and joyful as his first swing down a New York avenue! Breathtaking moments in all genres: romantic, revelatory, and even rambunctious ones! For a guy that grew up running home from school to catch the afternoon timeslot of my favourite comic-to-real-live-action show: The Amazing Spider-man starring Nicholas Hammond; it was everything I dreamed and more! The could've/would've bandwagon doesn't park at my place! It's a film to be enjoyed, not nitpicked, so enjoy it!","

"Spider-Man","tadavies-15568","17 February 2022","Watching Sam Raimi's spider-man trilogy is one of the most memorable parts of my childhood. As a reviewer I can accept that this could sway my opinion due to be blinded with nostalgia, however, I aim to be as professional as possible, this will be evident when I get to the third instalment of the trilogy.So what makes this film great? A number of factors do but to me it's the characters. With such a simple plot you need a strong cast and strong characters to take centre stage and they do, trust me.The highlight for me is the man himself Willem Dafoe who played my favourite character in this trilogy, Norman Osborn. Now I will admit some of this comes down to his lines that are delivered really well but have become glorified on the internet. But beyond this I think he's the best villain in this trilogy because he hits Peter where it hurts. When he finds he's Spider-Man he attacks his loved ones in a way the other villains don't do.As well as this, his goblin voice is iconic and he falls into the category of villains I love where they are actually having fun being evil. As Norman he also plays this cold distant man to his son and everything he does is perfect.The other great character in this is Peter Parker/Spider-Man. One thing I love about this trilogy and this film in particular that I feel none of the other on-screen interpretations master is the idea of Spider-Man and responsibility. Tobey Maguire isn't my favourite Spider-Man but he's my favourite Peter Parker because he grows in this film. This is most evident at the end when he gives up everything he wants because he knows it isn't the right thing to do. When faced with the possibility of joining the goblin he tells him that he had a father in the form of Ben Parker and gives up the love of his life knowing he'll hurt her. This is character development!What really emphasises all these character moments is the score by Danny Elfman. The iconic soundtrack hits at all the perfect moments and really conveys the tone of the scene along with the masterful direction of Sam Raimi. The plot is relatively simple which is good for an origin story and I love how we bounce back and forth between Peter and Norman.The side characters in this film are amazing too with Harry Osborn, MJ and Aunt May who all get standout moments. Even the smaller roles like Bruce Campbell as the wrestling announcer oozes character with about three lines of dialogue.Overall this is quintessential Superhero Cinema, if you haven't seen this you aren't a true Spider-Man fan.","

"Spider-Man","SnoopyStyle","22 February 2014","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who has a crush on his next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). His only friend may be Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of wealthy inventor Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). On a field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider, and he develops powers to become Spider-man. Meanwhile Norman is desperate to prove his formula for human performance to the military. When he test it on himself, it corrupts his mind and turns him into the Green Goblin.Sam Raimi has created a very good introduction to Spider-man. The actors are all very capable and fit their characters. Willem Dafoe is amazing as Green Goblin. The only minor complaint is the web slinging ability. It's a major change to comic lore, but I understand the reason. I always liked Peter Parker because he was the underdog nerd. So it's a great thing that this series starts off well. And who doesn't love an upside down kiss in the rain?","

"Spider-Man","carologletree","8 November 2016","The first Spider-Man film is a great one. Marvel arrived on the scene in 2000 with the solid if unspectacular ""X-Men,"" but it was kicked into higher gear in 2002 with the release of ""Spider-Man.""Tobey Maguire is phenomenal as Peter Parker, bringing just the right amount of nerdiness, vulnerability, and most importantly, heart. As Spider-Man, he really seemed to be having fun. He is comparable to Keaton's Batman and Reeve's Superman.The supporting cast is very good. Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane, and James Franco is also good as Harry. Other standouts are J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jamison and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin.Spider-Man's origin story is told quite well, and it moved along at a good pace. The film is very action-packed, and it is filled with the sense of fun that ""X-Men"" kind of lacked. Just the right amount of emotion is added to the film, and it also has a great soundtrack.There are a few cheesy scenes, but it is still overall a very entertaining and well-made superhero film. It was the kick in the pants that Marvel studios needed. Although this film would be surpassed by it's sequel, ""Spider-Man 2,"" it is still not to be missed.RATING: A-","

"Spider-Man","raysond","30 April 2002","I had the grand opportunity to see a special private screening of this eagerly anticipated movie and I must say I was definitely impressed and I was in total awe. Not since the last superhero movie I saw was there a more and clear and complete followup to the comic book and this one was totally it which had me on the edge of my seat and hanging on for more. ""Spider-Man"" is a grand transition to what a comic book hero supposed to be and for a good reason. It sticks to detail and while it does that it keeps its audience hanging on for more and then some. The acting of the cast was very,very good and for Tobey Maguire's performance as the teen stud Peter Parker/Spider-Man was the best characterization I've seen in a long time since the days of Christopher Reeve(who was the last good actor to play a superhero and to be true to the comic book format).As for the story itself,it kept its pace with the origins of the story and the comic book itself was right on precise target. As for the villain,actor William Dafoe was electrifying as Spidey's arch nemesis Green Goblin and the battle between him and our web slinger is something to behold. Even the leading lady,Kristen Dunst was not bad as Peter's girlfriend who keeps his identity a secret,but she knows who he is. As the good point of interest,the movie is worth the price of admission. Even if you're a fan of the Marvel comic book or a huge fan of Spidey's cartoon series of Saturday mornings,then this is the ticket to get. Be prepared for the ride of the summer,since this one is unbelievable. Kudos to director Sam Raimi for doing this right and finally bringing Spidey to the screen!!!!NOTE: There will be two more installments to the Spider-Man trilogy in which Spidey goes up against his greatest enemies like Dr. Octopus, Venom,and Mystiquo and not to mention the deadliest of them all...... DR. DOOM.","

"Spider-Man","adamjohns-42575","28 January 2022","Spider-Man (2002)-This is probably one of the few Comic Book to Film translations that gets the balance just right. Don't get me wrong, the whole 'Avengers Infinity Saga' is incredibly enjoyable, but seems to be based in a world closer to our own real existence and slightly less fantasy.In this film though, the use of a few more extreme elements - a quite camp Green Goblin, some corny lines and a camera filter that adds a slightly hand drawn feel to it, all seem to be just the right thing up against the everyday world seen otherwise.I actually love Tobey Maguire as Spidey. It's hard to pick between him and Tom Holland, because they are both so good, but I like the personality that Tobes delivers. I'm glad they chose to use him for the role and didn't opt for Leo as they might have done. There's a cute naÃ¯vetÃ© to him and he's got heart.Willem Dafoe on the other hand absolutely terrifies me and will never not be a source of nightmares.I do have to give credit to J. K. Simmons too. His portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson is superb and probably why they have used him in every incarnation of the web-slinger since. He's almost as iconic as the title character now.The special effects aren't the best, but they can be forgiven for the time that it was made. It's not ""Neville On The Broom"" bad at least. They're just a bit cartoony and somewhat computer game like by todays standards. It's easy to pick holes like that, when the technology we have 20 years later is so fantastically seamless and I'm sure that in 2002 I would have praised Tobey's CGI butt in his Spider-Man onesie.Fans of the comics that have read them from the start could probably list hundreds of reasons why this film is not right, but for me it's an easy and fun film to watch that is, for the most part family friendly. I know there was some indecision about its rating in 2002, but it's quite clearly a PG now.A great start to the Trilogy.795.55/1000.","

"Spider-Man","jeremycrimsonfox","4 August 2022","While Batman & Robin nearly killed the superhero genre by being a box office bomb that killed the original Batman film series, the year after would see it saved with the release of Blade, a movie that was a good mix of superhero and horror that, while bashed by critics, fans liked so much, that it would begin Marvel Comics' film success and opening the door to more superhero films. Spider-Man, the first in the Sam Raimi trilogy, would be the one to revolutionize the genre.Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) is a teen who is bullied, but has crush on Mary Jane Watson (played by. Kirsten Dunst) and is friends with Harry Osborne (played by James Franco), son of Oscorp CEO Harry Osborne (played by Willaim Defoe). However, getting bitten by a radioactive spider while taking pictures at Columbia University's Science Department, he soon develops the abilities and powers of a spider. At first, he uses his powers for fame and money, even competing in a wrestling match against Bonesaw (played by Macho Man Randy Savage), but he soon becomes a hero after his Uncle Ben is gunned down by a gunman he let escape when he robbed the wrestling organization. This leads him into a battle with Norman, who becomes the Green Goblin by subjecting himself to an experimental serum and killing his competitors and even his own board of directors for trying to oust him from his own company.Now this is an awesome movie for something in the early 2000's. Already, the film makes it clear Peter's origin as the wall-crawling superhero is not going to be a happy one, keeping the origin story true despite some changes (removing the TV performance, but keeping in the wrestling part, even going as far as to get an actual professional wrestler, Macho Man Randy Savage, to play Bonesaw, and Peter does not have web shooters, as the movie changes his powers to include the ability to fire organic webbing from his wrists), but it stays true to the comics, and keeps the important lesson ""With Great Power, There Must Also Come Great Responsibility"" that Spidey is well known for. The actors all do a good job, and the films manages to squeeze in some cameos (Bruce Campbell, who starred in the Evil Dead movies, one of Raimi's earliest directing credits, appears as the announcer for the wrestling march), and the music done by movie soundtrack legend Danny Elfman helps sets the tone. But the best thing is the special effects, which while not as advanced as the MCU Spider-Man films, as it makes good scenes, like Spidey and Green Goblin's parade fight.","

This is the first superhero movie I ever saw all the way back in kindergarten/first grade when it first came out and I've loved it alongside my brother throughout my whole childhood, but as an adult I appreciate it so much more for its more mature, genuine aspects. It's not as perfect or full of heart as the second one in my opinion but I still can't deny they will never make a superhero movie like this again and this is one of the best first installments of a superhero franchise that will ever be made. THIS is a true treasure folks, THIS is how you do a fun superhero movie with a likable real character, and yes, even the memes that would come from it are all a treasure as well!","

"Spider-Man","Nahret","29 April 2002","Pardon my language, but it does rock. It rules. It's beyond what I had imagined. After seeing a movie that fulfills almost impossible expectations, a little teenage language can be forgiven, I think. Let's not forget that Spidy is a hero with a cult following, so, naturally, there will always be those who see sacrilege in the few (good! necessary! favourable!) changes the creators of the movie made with respect to the original comic. To those: Come off it! This is a great film; it has the perfect balance of action, drama, laughs and the mandatory romantic element. And, of course, in this kind of event cinema, everything hinges on the right choice of a leading man, and in this aspect, Tobey Maguire is absolutely perfect (am I overusing this word?) as the slightly nerdish Peter Parker. As Auntie May rightly points out, Spiderman is not Superman; Peter's process of discovering and learning to control his powers are among the most hilarious scenes in the film (that spider web thing isn't as easy as it looks). Kirsten Dunst is as lovely as always, and Willem Dafoe would make a good Goblin even without the mask on. Speaking of the villain, not only are we given one whose motivations are understandable, but being who he is, he even opens the door to the sequel.All I can say, if the rest of the movie summer comes on as strong as this film, then we're in for a memorable year indeed. Not to mention the possibility of multiple sequels. 9 out of 10.","

"Spider-Man","Leofwine_draca","29 December 2016","As much as I am loathe to admit it, CGI effects have been getting better and better in recent years. Not always are they just silly cartoon imagery which looks out of place. And they're mainly responsible for the resurgence in superhero/comic book movies that wouldn't have been possible ten years ago - films like BLADE and X-MEN which rely on CGI effects throughout. SPIDER-MAN is the latest in a long line of comic book heroes being adapted for the big screen, and it isn't half bad. Hardly Sam Raimi's best movie but a thoroughly entertaining popcorn flick which is surprising in that it offers up a fairly adult version of the story with an interesting back story to set up the major characters and an emphasis on character development instead of mindless action. That's not to say the film is without action, but the various set pieces are made to count and not just overdone as they so could easily have been.Most of the elements that make up this film are good rather than brilliant, but the combination is pretty flawless. Obviously the superhero story has been done before but Raimi offers enough originality (along with a few spots of his previous craziness in the zooming skulls and spiders in the first transformations) and vitality into his film to make it feel fresh and exciting. The script is intelligent and offers up strong, likable characters with believable motivations; even the villain is a schizophrenic more to be pitied than hated. The music by Danny Elfman is rather unnoticeable but the film makes up for this with good camera-work and excellently staged scenes of action - the wrestling ring fight, the cliffhanger bridge ending, the carnival disaster are all excellent examples of the fantasy action genre at its finest, offering up explosive thrills and hard-hitting violence. This is a film where the punches count.The CGI effects are blended nicely into the action and for the most part are pretty good, only looking shoddy a couple of times. As for the actors, Tobey Maguire makes a decent and respectable hero and even though his character development from nerdy geek to romantic lead is rather clichÃ©d, he makes a good fist of it - congratulations to the boy. Willem Dafoe is all hamminess in the role of the Green Goblin, the film's hoverboard-riding villain, and is great as always, especially with that infectious laugh of his. Kirsten Dunst gets a fair amount of screen time as the love interest and even though her character is fairly useless at least she looks good in the part. Special mention goes to James Franco as Dafoe's brooding son Harry, who also happens to be Spidey's best mate. Watch out for the parade of cameo appearances which include Raimi cohorts Lucy Lawless as a punk, Bruce Campbell as the overbearing ring announcer, and Ted Raimi as a newspaper man. Probably the most bizarre appearance goes to porn star Robert Kerman as the boat captain - this is of course the same guy who played Professor Monroe in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Sadly he doesn't get to say ""I wonder who the real Spider-Man is?"".","

"Spider-Man","eagandersongil","6 September 2021","""Spider Man 1"" was a small industrial revolution, 6 years before Marvel started building its universe, Sam Raimi was in charge of adapting one of the biggest comics for the cinema, and it's amazing that even with the dated visual effects, this movie was very well built.Spider-Man's script is one of its greatest virtues, although a little clichÃ©, we don't have a construction focused on combat only, we have a beautiful origin story, with great development arcs not only by Peter Parker but also by Norman Osborn, Mary Jane , Harry Osborn in addition to Peter's uncles who play a perfect role of tutor in the hero's arc, with constructive details of the character's own character and mute problems, Peter doesn't want to save the world, he just wants to make a difference to his neighborhood, the The pain of the hero's growth here and its consequences are details that are lacking in today's practically canned superhero movie market.Tobey Maguire, has a weak acting, it's true, the actor is little expressive, but he is charismatic and sells very well the character that makes him an icon in the film, the same happens with Kirsten Dunst, and all the rest of the supporting cast is really very good with a big emphasis on Willem Dafoe who simply steals the scene whenever he appears, the actor, besides being absurdly expressive and scary has a unique screen presence.The aerial visual effects have aged well, but the combat scenes haven't, but we can forgive, by the way, it's been 20 years since its release, the film is immortalized, although nowadays films of this genre are cold, little authorial and simply common, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is the opposite of that, building a unique and striking identity. 7.5/10.","

"Spider-Man","alekspredator87","26 July 2022","When you remember Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man movie, you can't help but smile. This is probably because now it is an unshakable classic, one of the first superhero films, of which there are now a dime a dozen. This is a film from childhood, which essentially determined the state of affairs for children's minds. It was simple. There is good and there is evil. There are no complications in the plot, dual interpretations of situations. It's just that there is a protagonist and an antagonist, and they fight each other, as good fights evil, so that one of them wins and thereby shows an interesting story.Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy with Tobey Maguire has generally become something bright and simple. And the first film in this series tells a measured story about the formation of a young hero and his acceptance of the fallen power and responsibility. The genre of modern superheroics has not even been born yet, the now famous successful Marvel Cinematic Universe and the less successful DC Extended Universe are not even planned. The just-launched series about X-Men is somehow remembered as a kind of comparison with the story of Spider Maguire. And it's even good. The viewer learns to understand the simple rules of this world, to accept the absolute polarity of the characters, to comprehend the laws of the presented universe. It is for this reason and the repeatedly complicated comic world of films, as well as the generally ambiguous surrounding real world with many existing truths, ""Spider-Man"" by Sam Raimi allows you to immerse yourself in one story of a young man who is looking for himself and finds it his duty to become a friendly neighbor for the residents of huge New York.The film came out soulful and intense. The few main characters allow the director, with the help of a competent script, to introduce us to all the actors and show their evolution in the allotted couple of hours on the screen. Tobey Maguire and his Peter Parker fit perfectly into the concept of the story. Already an adult actor has always seemed to me suitable for this role of a high school student. His manners, shy smile, true emotions - all this made it possible to see in Toby a high school student Peter Parker, who begins his growing up and transformation from an ordinary unremarkable teenager into a young man who learns to make adult and balanced decisions.Kirsten Dunst became popular at a young age, having played well in ""Interview with a Vampire"". And her appearance in Spider-Man once again confirmed that she is a great actress. However, in my opinion, the script did not particularly allow her to open up in this film. Her heroine Mary-Jane Watson appears as a defenseless girl who constantly needs to be saved by a famous hero, she sometimes looks like a trophy in the struggle between the young heroes of the film (Peter Parker and Harry Osborne) than a real person. And once again, I am sure that this is not the problem of the actress's game, but rather a scenario blunder or even simplification of her character.James Franco is also good. Let him really reveal himself to me in the third film of this franchise, here the young actor adequately shows the younger Osborne as a man who has been looking for his father's approval all his life. This is a complex character with his own internal problems, which are also sure to come back to everyone in future films.A separate decoration of the film is the actor William Defoe. That's who really pulls the whole picture. His Norman Osborn will give odds to any villain. Defoe, as always, is charismatic, bright and dangerous on the screen. You can't negotiate with him, you can't get away from him. He is purposeful, dangerous and incredibly attractive as an antagonist. Watching the actions of the Green Goblin on the screen is a pleasure. Given the complex family and friendly ties in this small circle of the main characters, the viewer is sure that even a family dinner is unlikely to be able to take place in a calm friendly atmosphere when such diverse characters are at the same table.Be sure to mention the kind of calm characters, which are Uncle Ben and Aunt May - relatives of Peter Parker. They seem to be the glue that binds together the whole picture, they represent the morality of this world and teachers, probably, for all the heroes and viewers. ""Great power carries great responsibility"" is a saying that, probably, both I and many other fans have carried and continue to carry through their lives. After all, these words are very correct and teach you to be able to be responsible for your decisions, especially when you are already becoming an adult and should be responsible not just for your actions and responsibility for yourself, but also for your actions and your family in trying to give her the best, as well as protect her from a bunch of different problems.""Spider-Man"" was born very timely. This is an ageless classic for my generation, a breath of that almost ideal and simple world that could never have been in reality, but that existed in Raimi's interpretation, when everything around was much less complicated than it is now. Then you knew that the world is much simpler, it is predictable. Now, when you look around, you clearly understand that the world is multifaceted and complex, it is much more difficult to do things in it, and the results of actions are unpredictable. This was taught not only by real life, but also by many times complicated superhero paintings, of which several dozen have since been released. In them, the world seems much more real and dangerous. And this fact also makes me remember the first picture of the trilogy about Spider-Man Maguire with special warmth in my heart. After all, this is a well-forgotten past, which sometimes you want to revive by simply re-launching the picture on the screen and hearing the first chords of the famous melody from the colorful screensaver.10 out of 10.","

"Spider-Man","Horst_In_Translation","31 December 2014","""Spider-Man"" was the start to Sam Raimi's superhero trilogy starring Tobey Maguire, one of the most promising young actors back then, as Peter Parker. He does a solid job with the character. Raimi was mostly known at this point for another trilogy, namely the Evil Dead movies, which he started directing in his early 20s already. Apart from Maguire, the cast has many more famous names. Kirsten Dunst plays the love interest Mary Jane. I'm usually not too big on her as an actress, but she is okay here. Peter's uncle and aunt are played by Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson (who sadly died not too long ago just like his character here) and Golden Globe winner Rosemary Harris. The main antagonist, the Green Goblin, is played by Willem Dafoe and may very well be my favorite character and performance of the film. His son (and at the same time best friend to Parker) is played by the young rising star James Franco. J.K. Simmons has a small role here and he may very well win the Oscar this year. He certainly makes J. Jonah Jameson his own. And finally, Octavia Spencer, long before she became famous and won her Academy Award, plays a one-scene character as well.I wrote in the title that there is almost nothing wrong with this movie and you'd have to dig really deep to find something, maybe this could be the end. I found Mary Jane's love confession too cheesy somehow and Peter's reaction left a bitter taste too. It's the girl he loved all his life and he just says no to her. Cannot believe that even with the whole power-responsibility reference. But back to the more positive things. One of my favorite parts was how Parker and Osborn (Dafoe) had such similar paths to what they became. What Parker wanted most was MJ, what Osborn wanted most was the success of his company. First, both fight against outside influences (the enemy company, Flash), then against inside influences (the sale, Harry Osborn) in order to get what they want. Parker succeeds and fights for the good side. Osborn Sr. fails and becomes evil. Of course, apart from that the death of Parker's uncle and how it all happened also played a big role. It basically showed Parker that negative actions happening to other people can also affect him if he does not intervene.The movie runs for roughly two hours. There is a very clean split for Parker. The first half is about him being a normal boy who discovers his superpowers and we find out how he becomes Spider Man (including a funny wrestling match), who the people in his life are and how they shape him. The second half is pretty much all about the battle between Spider Man and the Green Goblin. Here, I especially liked the scene when Osborn realizes Spiderman's identity. That disguise scene in the burning house was great fun too. In the end, with the last comments from Franco's character, we get a bit of an appetizer for the sequel. On a random side-note, Raimi just recently reunited with Franco for ""Oz"".You could probably discuss if Maguire is a better actor than Andrew Garfield, but I have to say I definitely prefer Maguire's Spiderman. It works so well, even if he is already in his 20s playing a teenager and there are many memorable scenes in this film, including the kiss between Mary Jane and Spiderman obviously. Thumbs up for writer David Koepp who has also shown his talent on ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Mission: Impossible"" before 2002. And lets not forget Steve Ditko and Stan Lee, the latter even has a little cameo here. And finally a shoutout to Kevin O'Connell and Greg P. Russell, who scored one of the film's two Academy Award nominations and it seems they just cannot get the win. They would have deserved it for this one. Such a shame. The first Spiderman movie was, by far, the most seen film from the year 2002. Crowd magnets like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars came short. And for good reason. This is one hell of a joyride. Very much recommended.","

"Spider-Man","StevePulaski","2 July 2012","Peter Parker is the awkward, neurotic, socially inept teenager, interested in photography, and crushing on the prettiest girl in school, Mary Jane Watson. During his trip to a genetics laboratory, where the class learns all about genetically altered spiders, Peter is bit on the hand by one of the arachnids that escaped and slowly begins to possess powers beyond his wildest dreams. At first, he realizes he can see without the help of his glasses, next, he notices he can leap heights and flip to great lengths, and finally, he starts to acquire the ability to stick to walls and shoot webs out of his hands.He becomes the notorious and infamous, Spider-Man, where he has proved to be a burden to some, but a hero to others in his hometown of New York City, where he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). After his Uncle Ben is shot and killed during a robbery, Peter notices the city is nothing but scum and is determined to take down the cities' worst in the form of secrecy. Meanwhile, his close friend, Harry's (James Franco) father, Dr. Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the president of the Oscorp manufacturing corporation, where they make and supply weaponry to the United States Army. In the mix of it all, Osborn becomes, what newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) dubs, the ""Green Goblin"" who pilots a glider, and serves as the villain to Spider-Man's hero.What inevitably follows is a series of unplanned and very physical battle scenes taking place with the backdrop of New York City skylines to handle it all. There's also a subplot, involving Peter, played effortlessly well by Tobey Maguire, trying to impress Mary Jane, played by the talented and attractive Kirsten Dunst, by relentlessly saving her from calamity and trouble by sweeping in at the nick-of-time while she is either being held captive by the Goblin, intimidated by muggers or even falling to her death. The catch is Mary Jane doesn't know this is Peter, but on the side, she talks to him at various points in the film. They've lived next to each other for years, but Peter has always viewed her as the unachievable girl next door and Mary Jane has probably always found Peter to be the unfortunate geek next door. How she doesn't recognize his voice when ""Spider-Man"" saves her an astronomical three times is beyond me. She should probably stick to staying in doors.No bother. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is a fascinating and entertaining work of superhero fiction, collectively doing Marvel and all of its actors justice by blessing them with good material, a straight-shooting script, and action sequences that don't fail to impress. The kinetics and craft of it all are through the roof, and the twenty-five+ years the picture spent in development clearly was for the best. The film spends the first hour or so getting us acquainted with the man behind the mask, much like the original Marvel comics. We see Parker as a human, not an action figure, occupying a mask of uniqueness and power. The film shows the geek in the beginning, sympathetically, and then goes on to showcase him powerfully, where he is a placed in a role of certainty and bravery.Marvel comics were notorious for paying attention to the character behind the mask and the character in the mask. One thing Spider-Man neglects to showcase in its script and its main character is the agony and pain of it all. The second Marvel feature in 2003, Ang Lee's unfairly bashed Hulk, did a much better job at showing how a superhero's powers were more of a belligerent curse than a stroke of luck in a world of bitterness. Stan Lee infused his comics with so much life and enigma for the characters, plot progression, and the color of it all that the challenge to adapt it to film is definitely there. Raimi handles it appropriately and maturely, not becoming sidetracked with monotonous melodrama or overly-cutesy action sequences.The ones he does bring to the table are kinetic and stylish, showing off some of the most impressive photography and visual work of the year 2002, and brings two charismatic actors along for the ride. Spider-Man may not have the excruciating depth of Hulk, which created more cons than pros in the job of a superhero, along with establishing a sincere yet distant father and son relationship, but in its own right, it does so much in its two hours that you may need to stop for a breather.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. Directed by: Sam Raimi.","

"Spider-Man","jomayevans","16 December 2022","Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man. Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J. K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the world.","

This is a lot more than a superhero movie, if you grew up in the early 00's as a kid or teenager this was the movie to the years of your life, the girl next door, your struggles in school and life in general, your triumphs, your pains, the enemies you face. Besides that, this movie was a ray of hope, released one year after the horrible 9/11 it showed how one person can pick us back on our feet and how strength of unity can overcome the most serious of obstacles thanks to one great quote late in the move: ""You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!""

"Spider-Man","XweAponX","27 November 2012","By default, Comic Books are the perfect Pre-Viz for movies made based on them. And as a long-time Spidey fan, I was able to see the panels of this comic book come to striking life, sometimes reproduced with magnificent exactness in comparison to the way the books have been drawn and colored.As far as this initial offering goes, the choices of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe and James Franco allowed for an almost precise match to how the characters they each portray looked in the books. The casting of Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae, and J.K. Simmons as J Jonah Jameson: But it was not just the casting of actors who very closely resemble the characters of the Spider-man Universe, it was clearly Sam Raimi's direction in concert with the script by David Koepp based very closely on Stan Lee's ""Spidey"" Origin Story, which made these people come alive and pop out of the comic book frames, almost into real life.Compared to some of the other Marvel universe movies, this one was done with the most amount of care and respect for the series. Just to reproduce the postures of the flying web-slinger, using some of the most famous frames from the comics, was an astounding accomplishment.From his humble beginnings in ""Evil Dead"" Sam Raimi has been a clever filmmaker, especially in his ability to make splendid visual effects. Combine that with a huge budget along with Visual Effects god John Dykstra, who designed effects for Star Trek: The Motion Pic and the original Star Wars, back when it was still called that. Connect the dots with a fantastic Production Designer and Costume Designer, and it all just worked.One of the tests of how well Digital Effects have been done are in the viewing of these films on lower-resolution mediums, like smart phone screens and Old Cathode-Ray Tube TV's. I've viewed this film in each of those, and when Spidey is crawling up a wall in an obvious CGI shot, it makes you wonder if it really was CGI: In films like Daredevil, it is easy to spot the transition frames; here, it is impossible to find it.Comparatively, the work on Captain America showing Steve Rogers as a skinny kid is very clever. Here, the same tech is used in a smaller degree to show Parker as a wimpy, skinny nerd. This is highly effective so that when Parker sees himself buffed out with his shirt off, you believe a change has occurred.Where this film excels is in the rapidity of which it gets into the Spider-Man story, which is within the first ten minutes. As much as I do like the new Marc Webb ""Amazing Spider Man"" (2012) - It takes much too long to get into it, although the character development in that film is very good.In this film however, the character development continues through the film and is incorporated even into action sequences, Continuing up to the very last frame of the film.Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Dan Hicks (Of Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks) are all inserted as cameo properly as with any Raimi film. It is Campbell himself who ""names"" Spider-man - Saying ""The Human Spider? That Sucks!""My few complaints revolve around the character of Peter Parker, who is fairly unlucky in the books, here he is a walking disaster area. He is the antithesis of ""The Competent Man"" and even when given extraordinary ability, he is still a wimp in his personality, especially in his dealing with Mary Jane Watson. Also, Peter Parker's first Love interest was Gwen Stacy, and it was she, not MJ who The Green Goblin captured and gave Spidey the choice: Save these kids in the Cable-Car, or Save Gwen. It was a choice, and one or the other only could have been saved. Here, Gwen is absent totally, and he saves MJ with a feat even impossible for the comic- book rendition of Spidey.But I suppose adding Gwen to the mix would have muddied up the water too much. And even though I did not like the distortion of that original classic story, they did reproduce it visually with astounding correctness, as they did with the images of Spider-Man flying through NYC. Animating several classic Steve Ditko Spidey Postures, and at the end of the film we get to see many of these animated fantastically.But the main message: 'With Great power, comes Great Responsibility"" - As told by Uncle Ben to Peter right before his death, survives, and when coupled to Danny Elfman's main Theme, makes this a powerful, meaningful film.","

"Spider-Man","tedg","10 May 2002","Spoilers herein.I was profoundly disappointed in this because I expected a creative combination of two warring factions in filmmaking: the framers and the swoopers.Comics are rooted in the icons of preliteracy evolving into stained glass: brilliant colors and grand underlying mythology. Marvel comics (Stan Lee) adjusted the idiom slightly to make the mythology more accessible, and at the same time make each panel more active. He also popularized the overlapping of static panels on the page, so that not only was each panel composed, but each assembly of panels.Pulling on those two poles, the mythology and the framing, must be done simultaneously. By focusing more and more on the framing of the art, it allowed the referenced mythical power to increase. In other words, by making the images more static, the story became more dynamic and thus stronger. What made Spidey so novel was that his superhero action is primarily one of swooping and perching on oddly perspectived surfaces.So this particular comic, Spiderman, provides a much richer basis for effective film art than any other because it has a unique blend of framing and swooping. To appreciate the opportunity, you need to know one of the most lasting and interesting controversies in the film world.`Moving' pictures were seen as a sibling to `still' pictures which themselves inherited much from easel art. Similar equipment and conventions applied. All early movies placed the camera at eye level on a stationary tripod. The movement was one that a normal human observer would see. A second-order movement was introduced and mastered by Eisenstein, the movement of the camera from one shot to another. The individual shots were still from a stationary camera, but there was a choreography of the eye introduced. The setup of each shot was still essentially composed like a photo, rather like a comic panel in fact. The master of that today in film is Greenaway, but successful hacks like Speilberg mine what's been done. In fact folks like Speilberg compose their films first as comics (storyboards) and then replicate the frames.But there emerged a new school, led by Hitchcock that had the camera moving while the action moved. By controlling those moves, Hitch's camera had personality, curiosity. Tarkovsky and later dePalma mastered this and innovated so that some rare films have the eye as a main character. Today, essentially every filmmaker has a swooping camera because he/she can and because composing the Eisenstein/Kurosawa way requires insight beyond the skills of the current crop. So we now have a community of swoopers, mostly inept, constantly copying.So you can see how I got my hopes up. The Spiderman material was rooted in clever framing like Eisenstein/Kurosawa -- it is no accident that Peter Parker is the photographer of Spiderman.But it also depends on referencing and exploiting the swooping eye as with Tarkovsky/dePalma. It also makes heavy use of the odd-angled architecture of Welles, which clearly spilled more from his films into comics than into successor films.But what we get is a depressingly unoriginal treatment, wholly unaware of either the grand possibilities or even the educated eye. This is not just a pedantic concern -- you cannot have an exciting movie without an exciting eye. And this film's eye is hidden behind an inanimate mask. This is the Goblin's movie, not Spidey's","

"Spider-Man","Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23","29 June 2019","Intro:Many might be baffled by the 9/10 rating I gave this film. Many call it dated, and not as good as you remember. But, I think this film is every bit as good as you originally recalled, if not even better.What I Love:While this film is very cheesy, it's the classic origin of our favorite wall-crawler. I absolutely adore the storytelling of this film, with Sam Raimi's charm all over this film. From the incredibly relatable character of Peter Parker, and how he transforms into a superhero. As we see both the origins of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin happen at the same in the beginning of the movie.And while many might call it stupid, or over the top. These characters live in an over the top universe.And the world building is perfect. I feel like New York is a person. As we see the people of the city on screen. All the extras in this film are so colorful and have so much character, even though they're on screen for meat seconds.And every moment of this film is so fun to watch. The action, while dated, is very entertaining. The character interactions, are very entertaining. This was a childhood classic for me, and part of the reason I love it so much, is because it's very entertaining.I also enjoy the visual style of the film. It's so energetic in it's look. Just by looking at the film, you can tell Sam Raimi made it. It is drenched in his unique style of visuals. It uses CGI very well, and while the effects don't hold up, I think it helps the visual flare of this film. The city looks like it's out of a comic book, with the bright colors and vibrant locations.But, the best part of the film, are the characters. Toby MaGuire is still my favorite live action Spider-Man. And James Franco plays my favorite Harry Osborn. And Willem Dafoe plays the seriously over the top Green Goblin, and I love the performance.Peter Parker, he is played by an at the time, twenty something actor. Feels like a real needy teenager. He feels relatable. And he is an interesting character. Many might say he doesn't tell enough jokes. But I'm convinced it grounds him in a way. As it makes him feel more real. If I was battling a super villain, I wouldn't be telling be jokes, I would honestly be terrified.Harry Osborn, while in the other films, often over the top, Harry is still a three dimensional character. As he was often not treated well and neglected by his father. And his story over the course of this series. And this is demonstrated so we'll, in several scenes. Like when Harry introduces his father to Peter, calling him Norman Osborn, really showing the disconnect between the two. And at graduation, Norman congratulating Peter more than his own son.Norman Osborn is a really fun villain. With a wonderfully over the top performance in the part of Willem Dafoe. But he's a very interesting villain, as he was a rich businessman, who from the surface, seemed like a normal person. But from beneath, was really a cold hearted monster, and once he was turned into the Green Goblin, showed his true colors.Conclusion:Many might pick at the issues with this film, the campiness, the dated effects, the over the top nature, and other things. But that doesn't stop me from loving this film and the other two in the trilogy, even Spider-Man 3. I will always love the film. It was a great superhero film when it came out, and it's a great film even today.","

This film was a very good Spiderman, I've seen all the spiderman movies and I still agree with myself on the fact that this is the best one there has ever been, I've not since this liked every single character in the movie. One of the best peformances I've ever seen Tobey Maguire is a phenomenal actor who is so talented, he is the reason I like this movie so much, he plays Peter Parker so well and I didnt want to see anyone else play him.Lovee my opinion or hate it, you cant deny how truly entertaining this masterpiece is and always will be. I think anyone who is thinking of watching this movie shouldn't hesitate and should watch it right away, I saw it years ago but its worth the review, amazing movie no spidey comes close.I highly recommend watching this, even if you have... watch it again!","

"Spider-Man","lee_eisenberg","26 April 2006","I'll admit that I've never really been into comic books (or do people like to call them ""graphic novels""?). But whether you're into them or not, ""Spider-Man"" is sure to blow you away. More than just a superhero story, it shows how, as the title character reminds us: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" As Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire brings to the screen a superhero with whom we can all identify: misunderstood and searching for his goal in life. And Willem Dafoe makes one nasty, but cool, Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Other cast members include Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary Jane Watson; James Franco as Peter's friend (and Norman's son) Harry; Cliff Robertson as Peter's uncle Ben; and Rosemary Harris as Peter's aunt May.I also have to admit that around the time when this movie came out was the first time that I'd ever heard of Stan Lee (who appears in the movie briefly). Right before the release, he made a guest appearance on ""The Simpsons"" (the episode where Bart creates an online cartoon about Homer's mishaps). Two thousand two must have been a great year for Lee.All in all, you're sure to love this movie. I also recommend ""Weird"" Al Yankovic's song ""Ode to a Superhero"" (parodying ""Piano Man""), about the movie. Just great. I guess that Rosemary Harris is probably the only actress who can lay claim to starring in a movie about Hungary's history (""Sunshine"") and a superhero movie.","

-great visuals.Even in 2002 you have amazing swinging scenes and great action. If you compare scene to scene with newer spiderman movies there's a clear decline for the latest releases. This movie was ahead of its time and still holds up both in story and effects.","

"Spider-Man","nmholland","30 March 2016","Spiderman is directed by Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire as the awkward high school nerd Peter Parker. On a field trip to a science lab, Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained superhuman abilities of strength, reflexes, and heightened senses. He also now has the ability to stick to walls, and to shoot spider webs out of his wrists. When a new villain comes to town, a guy that calls himself the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Peter must handle his nerdy high school life, all while trying to save the city and the girl he loves, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).Spiderman was one of the first Marvel films ever made, right behind X-Men (2000), and it literally made my childhood. I had Spiderman posters, bed sheets, window curtains, you name it. Spiderman was a very influential movie, and still holds up to day. People still love the original Raimi trilogy (or, the first two), and most like Tobey Maguire better than Andrew Garfield (no offense Garfield fans). This film is pretty close to perfect, and I'm here to tell you why.One of the best things this film can offer is the close to perfect casting. Although Maguire might not make the best Spiderman, he definitely fits the role of Peter Parker, the high school loser that can't get anything besides his grades right. James Franco as Harry Osborn was a great choice, and was much better than Dane DeHaan with a face full of acne. Kirsten Dunst was a pretty good choice for Mary Jane, although I could've seen some other actress dye her hair red and then scream for two hours. Willem Dafoe was an amazing choice for Norman Osborn, or Green Goblin, and handled that role with a lot of confidence and pulled it off nicely. However, the best casting choice was J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. I truly believe that this was one of the best casting choices made in a film, ever. Simmons played Jameson perfectly, and was a highlight in every film, even the third one, but we don't talk about that.Another great thing this movie pulls off is the direction and special effects. Sam Raimi is a great director, we all know that, but he does even better in these films than in the Evil Dead franchise. His work with the camera brings a feel to Spiderman that nobody else, including Marc Webb, could handle correctly. Now, the special effects in a couple parts look somewhat dated, but overall, they are really good. Most of them still hold up today, except for a couple shots here and there.The score is also an extreme highlight of the film, done masterfully by Danny Elfman. Not even the great James Horner could replicate what Elfman did, when it came time to make The Amazing Spiderman (2012). The score adds an epic sense of liveliness to the film, especially in the action scenes (more on that later). The score sounds good with the film, or by itself, which really makes for a good soundtrack.Now, the action scenes were directed beautifully, and were very clean without an over abundance of cuts, especially the end fight between Spiderman and the Green Goblin. All of the impossible jumps that Spiderman makes, or when he swings from structure to structure look amazing, and this is all thanks to Raimi and his abilities with the camera. He can make a talking scene look nice, or he can make an action scene look nice, which is a great quality for a director to have.The best thing about this film is easily the vulnerability of our hero, Spiderman. Throughout the entire movie, Spiderman gets the crap beaten out of him, both physically and mentally. His thoughts are attacked, his body is attacked, his loved ones are attacked, and this is what makes the Green Goblin a great villain. He knows all of Spiderman's weaknesses, and he strikes them right where he should. This is where the film shines most, when the hero gets his butt kicked. This is because when the hero finally rises up to overcome the seemingly impossible hurdle, it makes the audience feel all that much better about his victory. This is common in all great films that contain a ""hero"", such as every film in the Dark Knight trilogy, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and even movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).Now, the only complaint I had, and this is very nitpicky, is the suit of the Green Goblin. There's no way to let it down easily, he looks like a Power Ranger. Although the suit doesn't look bad, they should've gone with something a bit more realistic, and not just completely comical. If they would've done this, he wouldn't have looked like a Power Ranger, and he possibly would've looked as cool as he actually was.Overall, Spiderman is an amazing superhero movie, and an amazing movie, and one of the best origin stories put to film. I recommend Spiderman to anyone and everyone; it's worth your time.","

"Spider-Man","mastuhoscg","8 April 2019","I like this movie. I remember watching it at a young age & I was happy. I especially liked how Tobey Maguire was Spider-Man. He looked exactly like Peter Parker & he was the best actor for the part. If it wasn't for him & Columbia Pictures, this film would have NOT made as much money as it did. I can honestly say that this is gonna be a delightful action movie for you Spider-Man fans worldwide. If you haven't watched this film already, you should. It is that good, much better than into the spider-verse.","

"Spider-Man","emjgiddy","13 September 2023","""Spider-Man"" is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves a perfect 10-star rating. Directed by Sam Raimi and released in 2002, this film not only set the standard for modern superhero movies but also captured the essence of what makes Spider-Man one of the most beloved and iconic characters in the world of comic books.At its core, ""Spider-Man"" is a coming-of-age story about Peter Parker, brilliantly portrayed by Tobey Maguire. We watch Peter transform from a high school outcast into the selfless and courageous hero that is Spider-Man. Maguire's portrayal is endearing and relatable, making Peter's journey one that resonates with audiences on a deeply personal level.The film's antagonist, Norman Osborn, played by Willem Dafoe, is equally compelling. His transformation into the maniacal Green Goblin is both tragic and chilling, providing a formidable and multi-dimensional foe for Spider-Man. The dynamic between hero and villain is a central element of the film's success.""Spider-Man"" excels in storytelling, with a well-paced narrative that balances action, drama, and character development. The film explores Peter's struggles with his newfound powers, the responsibilities that come with them, and the sacrifices he must make. These themes of power and responsibility lie at the heart of the Spider-Man mythos and are expertly woven into the narrative.The action sequences are groundbreaking, with Spider-Man's acrobatic web-swinging and combat choreography still holding up remarkably well today. The film's practical effects and visual effects were groundbreaking at the time and continue to impress.Raimi's direction brings a comic book sensibility to the screen, with dynamic visuals and camera work that evoke the feel of the source material. The film captures the spirit of New York City, and Danny Elfman's iconic score adds to the sense of heroism and adventure.""Spider-Man"" is not just a superhero film; it's a timeless classic that transcends the genre. It beautifully captures the essence of Spider-Man's mantra, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" and delivers a heartwarming and thrilling story that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. It's a film that not only redefined superhero cinema but also remains a testament to the enduring power of storytelling in the world of cinema. A perfect 10-star rating is well-deserved for this iconic film that continues to inspire and entertain generations of fans.","

"Spider-Man","utgard14","13 May 2014","Nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bit by a radioactive spider and develops new powers and abilities. After the murder of his uncle, Peter decides to use his powers to help people and fight crime. Meanwhile, billionaire Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) undergoes an experiment that gives him superhuman abilities of his own. It also drives him crazy and sets him on a collision course with Spider-Man.Maguire, James Franco, and J.K. Simmons are all great. Kirsten Dunst wasn't my ideal Mary Jane but she actually does very good. She's likable and pretty, which is about all the part is asking for here. The Green Goblin is probably the movie's biggest failing. They didn't really get his character right and Willem Dafoe's performance is too campy. Changing him into an armored goon didn't help matters.The bright, mostly upbeat tone is exactly what a Spider-Man movie needs. However, it does highlight some of the fakeness of the CGI. The special effects are generally good although at times when Spider-Man is complete CGI he has that rubber-limbed thing going on. The organic web shooters bothered me more before I saw the movie than it did while watching. Although I could've done without the gross microscopic closeups of his fingertips to show us how ""spidery"" he is. Danny Elfman's score is forgettable and not in the same league as his work with Batman.Not quite the defining movie for Spider-Man as '78 Superman or '89 Batman were for those characters, but good nonetheless. The part of the movie where Peter decides to become a superhero and start fighting crime seems a little rushed and not as momentous as it should have been. It's a good start, though, and the sequel would be all that and more.","

"Spider-Man","philip_vanderveken","21 February 2005","Comic books like Spider-man, Superman, Hellboy,... have always been a part of the American popular culture, but aren't well known by the biggest part of the European public. So when a movie, based on one of these comics (we've seen several passing by in the multiplexes in recent years) is released, its main audience will be American as well. Unless they make something spectacular out of it of course, and that's exactly what the makers did with this movie. Spider-man is a movie full of spectacular computer animated graphics, plenty of action and symbolism and, much to my surprise, with a decent story (even though that's not the main reason why you should watch this movie).Peter Parker is a nerdy high school student who gets bitten by a genetically modified spider. Its DNA gets mixed with Parker's DNA and gradually he finds out that he now has capabilities he could only dream of before. He's strong, he can scale walls and ceilings without any help or appliances and he has some kind of sense that allows him to avoid dangerous situations. At first he only uses his powers to make money as an amateur wrestler, but when his uncle gets killed by a criminal, he decides to use his powers only to fight crime and to help society and to win the affections of his classmate Mary Jane Watson. In the meantime Norman Osborn, a scientist and businessman is exposed to some kind of nerve gas that he was developing for the military and develops an alternative personality: the evil Green Goblin.Despite the fact that the Green Goblin looked more like a bad guy from the ""Power Ranger"" and wasn't very original or impressive to me, the entire movie wasn't as bad as I feared. I actually had a good time watching this movie that, let's be honest, wouldn't get much attention if the stunning computer graphics weren't in it. So, despite the fact that I'm not a fan of comic books and the fact that the Green Goblin wasn't the most successful character, I liked what I saw. That's why I give it a 7.5/10.","

"Spider-Man","peytoncanaan","23 February 2021","Oh my god. Well, I can honestly say this is one of the best Marvel movie of all time and one of the best superhero movies of all time. I'm sorry folks, but this movie really struck me. I love the characters, their motivations and their goals. Each character are extremely relatable. I love Tobey Maguire as Spiderman. He is quite honestly the best movie Spiderman we have ever seen. He is such a lovable dork that says beautiful things when at the right moment. Willem Dofoe as the Green Goblim is such a joy to see, he is hilarious and is probably one of my favorite superhero villains in cinema. This movie is so corny, that you honestly can't stop smiling. Superhero movies don't always have to take anything seriously, and this is a movie that is the perfect example. Also JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is perfection. Whoever casted him to play the character should be a millionaire because he is actually the best thing about this movie. The only problems I have are the outdated CGI for being a little bit too bouncy, and some of the acting can be not the greatest. But this movie is still good I think it could still hold up today being an amazing superhero movie. 9/10","

I thought that the genre of films about superheroes was not mine, but I was very much mistaken (at least I draw conclusions based on the film I watched). The movie ""Spider-Man"" first of all seemed to me very instructive. It clearly shows how just one case can change a person's whole life, and indeed his worldview. This situation that happened in the film reminded me of one phrase: ""A man learns only from his own mistakes.""The plot of the film is more than interesting, and despite the fact that the film goes on for quite a long time, it is watched in one breath. There are so many moments in the movie that make me want to cry...","

"Spider-Man","ThunderKing6","6 December 2021","Oh by the way MCU for this review means Mediocre Cinematic Universe.This one is really hard to judge in 2021. I've seen these movies dozens of times in the past but not in awhile sort of (youtube clips). I've been watching some clips and watching rants against Tobey Spiderman, Long Neck Spiderman and of MCU Spider-Man and my judgment of these films have slightly changed.Story: A Khazarian looking Spiderman is bitten by a bug and now plays superhero. He must balance his Peter Parker, his world, city and his Spiderman.Production: It was a well grounded and engaging film. At the time it was top-notch effects. Still Today it holds up in some places and some places are really corny. From rewatching, Tobey looks really bored. He had no range, no excitement he was just a bored superhero. It was like he didn't want to be there. All other actors/characters were great. The Chemistry in the first one was mostly there.Main Intelligence: Peter is a smart kid. Norman is a smart dude. I just don't understand why Peter wants to save worthless people who don't care about themselves. Pete is just a kid endangering himself to save people who are weak and ignorant. To me, he's kind of dumb for that. Haim Saban the producer of Power Rangers once called his Power Rangers ""5 R*t*rds in spandex"". When I look at this Spiderman he reminds me of the Power Rangers seeming like a R*t*rd in spandex"". I like Spiderman and superheroes, but upon rewatching and recently watching Ultimate Spider-Man it just made me think.Highlight: Green Goblin was iCONIC. He was a simple psycho villain. His banter, him gliding was cool. I have no beef with the costume. I think producers thought this movie would fail and had no confidence in superheroes. That's why they probably cast a borderline decent actor in Tobey and the movie looks cheap in some places.Cliffhanger: Harry wants revenge against Spider-Man. What he doesn't know Peter is Spiderman. #PeterParkerisatrollloki. To me Peter felt like a Loki because he wasn't being honest to his friend.Should you watch this movie?: Yes. If you are a superhero geek. This movie was simple and fun. Other than Blade, Spider-Man helped add coal to the superhero movie era preMCU. It's not a movie to take seriously despite Tobey's boring, dull persona it's a fun flick to chill and watch. The extras were funny as heck in this one. It has tons of memorable moments. Prior to I always rated Tobey Spider-Man as superior. I still think it is due to it being so grounded and very cartoony. Amazing Spiderman looked dull and depressing, however that Pete though annoying had more energy than Tobey Parker. I'm not one to be enslaved by fan service or nostalgia, so today I was eager of knocking the rating from a 9 to a 5 or 7. I'll keep it as 9. It's also weird that this movie is in the 7.3's. I thought it would be above 8.3. Oh, well.","

Stop right there. This is not that kind of review. Instead, I will give you several reasons why you should watch Homer Simpson and his ""Spider-Pig"" rather than this or any other ""Spiderman"" sequel.1. Spider-pig is funny. Tobey is merely sleepy and boring. 2. Spider-pig walks on the ceiling with grace. Tobey doesn't. He looks like an apathetic, clumsy 30 year-old moron impersonating a teenager. 3. Spider-pig has a great sidekick: Homer. Spiderman has none. 4. Homer's relationship with Spider-pig is far warmer and real than Spiderman's could ever be with Kirsten Dunst. 5. Spider-pig has Danny Elfman's likable tune to follow his zany adventures. Tobey/Spiderboy has only crap commercial U.S. truck-driver rock to accompany his every sleepy move. (Note those always semi-closed eye-lids; rumours say 500 angry tse-tse flies stung him...)6. Spider-pig emits huge amounts of toxic excrement as a way to hurt his enemies. Spiderboy just shoots unconvincing CGI strings. 7. Spider-pig is much more handsome than Tobey Maguire. 8. Spider-pig is alert and quick. Tobey is drowsy and dull. 9. The pig that plays Spider-pig is a much better actor than Tobey Maguire.The only aspect in which Raimi's Spiderman franchise beats Spider-pig is that Tobey's girlfriend Dunst is much better-looking than Spider-pig's sow mistress.The success of the ""Spiderman"" movies proves two things, first and foremost: 1) today's film-goers will watch any crap and love it, as long as it's hyped properly and sufficiently, and 2) Sam Raimi will never make another movie that comes even within light-year distance of his first two ""Evil Dead"" movies.If you loved ""Spiderman"", you must be either 9 years old or a...","

"Spider-Man","Red_Identity","23 March 2012","Overall consensus on Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise?by you I only saw the third once, when it came out, so I don't remember it enough to actually judge it. But, rewatching the first two today I was reminded of how great they are. Raimi perfectly blends in cheese, camp, humor, drama, and action in one fantastic package. The comic book style is still in tact, and I noticed that unlike Nolan's Batman franchise, the heart is apparent here. These films give off a good-natured, mainstream vibe. The characters are all excellently written, and so it makes it so easy to relate to them. Raimi does so much with the source material in the way it's all edited together. The first two are honestly great and perhaps as great as something like this could ever be, so why why WHY reboot (remake) this after 10 years? There's simply no reason. It's not like the trailers for the new one suggested it to be darker, because these aren't dark and yet their dramatic moments hit hard. I hate to say it, but I do think that Raimi did more to this franchise than Nolan ever did to the Batman one. People like to criticize Nolan's writing, but I think the reason why his films' flaws are more apparent on rewatches is because of his direction style. Technically amazing, both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but as much as he tries he can't make the smaller moments count. Maybe it is his screenplays, or I simply don't know. My point is, after The Dark Knight people forgot all about these films (and because the 3rd left a bad taste). People like giving TDK credit for being dark and complex, and while it's true that it's tone is different than others of the sort, I think Raimi's films have a lot more to them. I simply just don't know why a reboot happened.","

"Spider-Man","timefreezer7","21 November 2003","Directed by Sam RaimiWritten by David KoeppStarring: Tobey Maguire , Willem Dafoe , Kirsten Dunst and James FrancoAfter years of anticipation and a never ending court battle concerning the legal rights ,  a big budget cinematic adaptation of the well known comics superhero has finally made it to the movie theaters . First of all I should say I was never much of a Spider-man fan , I have never read comics but is there any person on earth who doesn't know the red clad hero who jumps from building to building ? I doubt so . My only knowledge of Spider-man was some cartoon show where he makes a dynamic trio with Iceman and Fire-Star . I am not aware of anyone of Spidey's enemies and I was not familiar with his origin and motives . Nevertheless I am keen on comics generally and I always like seeing comics characters materialize on celluloid . So I got really excited when I heard that the project FINALLY got green-lighted and that Sam Raimi eventually took it upon him to shoot the Spider-man motion picture . I will have to admit that most of the comments are 100% right . Spider-man (2002) may not be a GREAT film but it sure is a good one (and it beats the hell out of the overrated and disappointing 2000's X-Men) .I don't think the plot is significant . The movie remains as faithfully to its comics origins as it could be and it satisfies both the hardcore well-knowing fans and the uninitiated like I am . Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy 17 year old student ,  not much accepted by his social environment and constantly being picked by his bullies classmates . He has a secret crush on the beautiful girl next door Mary Jane `M.J.' Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly knows he exists . When he is bitten by a mutated super spider he is bestowed with special powers like climbing on windows with his bare (albeit sticky) hands , ejecting spider nets from his arms , incredible acrobatic agility and enhanced danger-approaching instinct. While he tries to adjust to his newly obtained powers he finds himself caught in a war that a fiendish super criminal called the Green Goblin has declared against him . The Green Goblin is a maniac who wreaks havoc and kills innocent people using military equipment and weaponry . He believes that Spider-Man is the only real threat and wants to bring him down . The Green Goblin is actually the alter-ego of Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) a very wealthy businessman / scientist who has started developing a split personality and the deranged Green Goblin becomes more and more dominant driving him to madness . Norman's son is Harry (James Franco) who coincidentally is Peter's best friend and classmate . So Spider-Man will try to stop the Green Goblin before he kills more civilians and simultaneously will try to get Mary Jane's attention .That's it folks . The film spends much more time on the love story between Peter and Mary Jane and less on action . I always like character development and human relationships unfolded in superhero films but a little more action wouldn't heart either . Basically we see Spider-Man beat up some random thugs on alley streets and that's it . The balloon sequence in the middle of the film is nice but awfully reminiscent of Batman (1989) . I wish there were more epic battles between Spider-man and Green Goblin with more explosions . Some other things I didn't like either were :
1) Even worse CGI SFX than the robot soldiers in the Phantom Menace !!! I never thought it could happen but here it is . The shots of Spider-Man in the beginning of the film jumping from the top of a building to another is a lame cartoon that will not convince even a 3 year old viewer . I cannot describe how laughable and fake this Spider-man cartoon is : you will have to see for yourselves .2) The acting is average from all the actors . None of them manages to deliver fully the dramatic depth of the characters as scripted by the writer. The worst performance belongs to Willem Dafoe . His mirror communication scene was nicely scripted but Dafoe is extremely bad and unconvincing . What exactly happened here ? I liked him in Body of Evidence and Speed II but his talents seem to have been erased in this film . I will have to admit that some of the Green Goblin's lines gave me the creeps but can anyone assure me that it was really him under the suit (or his voice for that matter) ? Maguire's  and Dunst's acting is better but still mediocre . Speaking of the duo , one other flaw is that they don't have enough chemistry together (like Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder) . If they made a more fitting pair the screen time spent in their romance would be more worthily used . And if James Franco has the most impact screen presence is because his character requires for him to sit back and look calm and cool (and it is obvious that's the reason why they cast him) . The secondary characters like Peter's uncle and aunt act OK but that newspaper editor was too annoying to like him.3) The Green Goblin is never developed and is not much of a formidable foe . Maybe it was intentional to give him little screen time in order not to pull another scene-stealer (a la Joker) and give all the focus on Spider-Man . Unfortunately a great action film always needs a powerful evil character to be the opposition AND the driving force for the hero's existence .
Aside from these flaws the movie has all the features of a good blockbuster . The red suit of Spider-Man is faithful and really convinces us that the character has come to life ! There are some good scenes like the one where Peter finally beats up one the bullies in school . My favorite scene in the movie is a great surprise and that's why I cannot give it away. All I can say if you haven't watched the film , is the sequence where the Green Goblin sings `The itsy , bitsy spider.' . I also digged the final duel between Spider-Man and Green Goblin . Without being too violent it is an exciting fight , larger-than-life and worth our money . I just wish the rest of the movie reached the same adrenaline levels . Despite a lackluster performance , Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker . He suits the geeky looks the character has and convinces as a 17 year old with continually growing power (physical and personal) . The film has an obvious open end as a set up for the sequel . Much like some recent blockbusters like the Matrix or X-Men the first film is clearly an introductory chapter wanting to lure the audience to a whole franchise . You wait for more action in the next film , more exploitation of the potential of the story and you have a curiosity to find out where the relationships between the protagonists will lead . Spider-Man however manages to rise above the aforementioned films . Why ? Because it is a GOOD introduction . Where X-Men made the mistake of under using  10 characters without any success , Spider-Man has ONE main character . This is what I like most about Raimi's film . We follow Peter Parker from the very beginning . We have a taste of his life before the drastic change occurs and then we have the transformation in front of our eyes full play ! There is not a single superhero film that bothered to show us the beginning of the character . Obviously they thought it would be dull for the already initiated comic book fans but they were wrong . Yes there are other films with scenes were the motives were explained like Batman and some opening establishing scenes like the first Superman . But Raimi's Spider-Man is unique : we SEE Peter Parker training with his super powers , trying to control them and we even get to see him pick his costume . Now I will keep my reservations because I have yet to see the recent batch of Marvel comic-book adaptations like Daredevil or Hulk but for now Spider-Man is the best introducing film you will find . The metaphor about the responsibility of a teenager turned into a mature adult is also explored . The realistic approach is successful here . First of all the first thing Peter does with his powers is to try earning money . Only later he decides to use them for the city 's good and safety . Secondly despite some nitpicking from fans it is quite logical that Spider-man's web-shooting is an organic power . Peter is just 17 and as much as he is supposed to be a science genius he wouldn't have the money or the technology to invent some synthetic web shooters . The Green Goblin outfit sure looks like a Power Ranger suit but it is also realistic as it is a piece of military equipment and not a Halloween costume . New York City is depicted as a shiny town and establishes a truly existing environment for the story to take place .Spider-Man (2002) for all its weaknesses is a good film with some of the best narrative I have seen . The voice-overs by Maguire help us identify with him even more . The film is better than some other comic book flicks like Phantom or Spawn (not entirely their fault since these characters are less appealing and therefore less known) Dick Tracy , The Mask or the Shadow (good idea but mediocre script / execution) or over hyped blockbusters like the X-Men . It will not be a classic like Superman II or Batman but it is one of the best of the bunch of the `comic-book' genre . I rank it up there with the 3 Batman sequels , Judge Dredd and the original Superman .

"Spider-Man","mark.waltz","18 July 2023","The Marvel comic world exploded into cinematic existence with the first big screen adaption of the popular comic strip, and it's one of the greatest super hero movies ever. Toby McGuire is perfection as geeky high school student Peter Parker whose reaction to the bite of a genetically altered spider is to turn into a young man who can shoot webs out of his hands, do back flips and other gymnastic movements and climb walls. ""With great power comes great responsibility"", his uncle and surrogate father Cliff Robertson tells him, so the entirely decent McGuire decides to use these powers for good, fighting crime, that is after he gets revenge on high school bullies and the thug who was responsible for his uncle's death.Veteran actors Robertson and Rosemary Harris are delightful as his aunt and uncle, with Harris's gentle demeanor hiding a no-nonsense view of life, and you can see why Peter has turned out to be a great young man. Willem DaFoe is the father of his only school friend who has a metamorphosis himself, but it's the complete opposite, turning into evil as the green goblin, even though his human self is law abiding and basically decent. As the feisty girl he likes, Kirsten Dunst plays an A group girl who tends to stand up for the underdog, and that makes her quite likeable, even though she has questionable tastes in boyfriends. That is until she sees Peter for who he is, although completely unaware of his secret powers. Joe Manganiello is very funny as the fast talking newspaper editor who takes a chance on Peter as a free lance photographer.The special effects are outstanding and the pacing non-stop. Watching McGuire go from clumsy kid to superhero is amusing as he slowly learns of all his super powers and how to best work them. The streets of New York City have never gotten such a special effect laid workout on film, even with asteroids, ice ages and tidal waves attacking it, and the best Macy's Parade since the original ""Miracle on 34th Street"". No sequel or resurrection or even a scandal ridden campy (and unnecessary) Broadway musical can recapture what this film brought, pure big screen magic. Another rare modern classic that left me with a goofy grin throughout my viewing.","

"Spider-Man","BA_Harrison","4 July 2014","Having already proved himself more than capable of creating a fun comic-book style movie with Darkman (1990), Sam Raimi finally had a crack at the real thing in 2002 with Marvel's Spidermanâ€”and he did a remarkably good job, delivering a slick, action-packed, major-studio, summer blockbuster that genuinely feels like a superhero comic-strip brought to life, with colourful cinematography, perfectly nuanced performances and the director's playful visual style very much in evidence (as opposed to those dreary Nolan Batman films that take matters far too seriously).Starring Tobey Maguire as the titular web-slinger, Spiderman is an 'origins' movie, and as such takes a while to get the slam-bang action, but the characters are so well defined and the script (by David Koepp) so smartly written that boredom is never an issue. I've never been much of a fan of comic book movies that dwell too heavily on the whole 'tortured soul' aspect of their central character (as in Nolan's miserable Batman films), and with Spiderman being one of Marvel's classic 'emotionally troubled' heroes, there was serious potential for this to be a rather joyless affair. Thankfully, Raimi handles the personal trauma in such a manner that it never drags the enjoyment factor down. This is pure entertainment all the wayâ€”a real corker of a superhero film that still has the power to wow well over a decade after its original release.","

"Spider-Man","med_1978","15 November 2005","I would like to say firstly I am not a Comic Book nut and have in fact hardly read any. But I do like Comic Book/Superhero Movies. Having seen a great many Comic Book Characters/SuperHeroes/Vigilantes brought to the big & small screens such as Darkman, The Flash, Batman, Spawn, X-Men, The Hulk, The Crow, Superman etc. I must say I did enjoy Spiderman and it was slightly better than I anticipated. I remembered seeing re-runs of the Nicholas Hammond TV Series in the late eighties when I was a teenager and thought them OK but a bit lame. I am not a fan of any of the Stars in Spiderman either (although I think Willem Dafoe is a good actor). I found myself thoroughly entertained from beginning to end, however that is all this movie is ENTERTAINMENT. The fact that Peter Parker is bitten by the Spider in the beginning and no-one else is, is a little hard to swallow, why does it not bite other people then we could have loads of Spidermen!(in reality spiders mostly keep away from people). But if you don't think about the what if's etc. and go along for the ride it thoroughly entertaining fast paced fun. There are the usual clichÃ©s, the mad scientist who must test his work on himself resulting in changes of mood and eventually becoming the villain (see The Fly & Hollow Man for other examples of this), the fight with the School Bully, and the ending is predictable.I found the romantic Scenes between Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst to be surprisingly the best parts of the film, and also the scenes where Willem Dafoe's personality is being taken over by his alter ego The Green Goblin.Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker was completely believable and having now seen him in the role I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it better, Kirsten Dunst was good as Mary Jane, I also though James Franco was good as Parker's friend and unbeknown to him the son of the principal villain Willem Dafoe, whose performance was as usual very good although a little over the top as the Goblin but this is the norm I guess with this type of film. I also thought Cliff Robertson was okay in his small part.I prefer darker comic book films and found The Crow, Batman (1989), Batman Returns and X-men to be better films. This Film is however is WAY BETTER than all the overrated Superman films (far too much humour)and The Hulk, Batman Forever, Batman and Robin, Catwoman, The Punisher, Daredevil, Elektra & Sam Raimi's own Darkman + all The Crow sequels.I would give this film 5 1/2 or 6 out of 10","

"Spider-Man","michaelRokeefe","20 May 2002","Kudos to director Sam Raimi for giving the human touch to the popular comic book hero. The story is interesting enough and the action moves the story at a good pace. Tobey Maguire is well suited for the part of Peter Parker, but I'm having trouble with him transforming into Spider-Man. Willem Defoe is great as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. I am most impressed with Kirsten Dunst and even get a kick out of the red hair. It is also good to see veteran actor Cliff Robertson working again. Over all, the movie is very entertaining. Amazing F/X and the Danny Elfman score deserve credit for this movie's success. I hate to say that SPIDER-MAN is not my choice for this summer's blockbuster. A pretty good movie, but to me not a 'knock your socks off' flick.","

"Spider-Man","HotToastyRag","24 February 2020","I'm extremely loyal to the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man series. In my opinion, there are no other acceptable versions, and I'd never even consider watching the subsequent remakes. Tobey is the perfect Peter Parker, and the movies are treated with such care and respect, they don't feel like traditional comic book movies at all.The first one is the origin story, and who doesn't love the first in a series when everything is explained and introduced? Tobey is the unpopular, shy high schooler who has a crush on the girl next door and lives with his aunt and uncle. Mary Jane, the beautiful heroine, is played by Kirsten Dunst, and while she famously dyed her locks red for the subsequent movies, she wears a wig in the first one. I prefer the shiny, lustrous wig since it's more vibrant and attention-grabbing. Rosemary Harris may retain her role as Aunt May in all three movies, but Cliff Robertson gets to deliver the immortal line, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Everyone in this movie is memorable and important, and if you grew up watching this franchise in the theaters, your loyalty probably lies with them. J.K. Simmons seems like he crawled off the comic pages as the hard-boiled newspaper editor with hilarious one-liners. Who else can play the father-son Osborns but Willem Dafoe and James Franco, a pair of actors capable of being incredibly likable with a darker edge beneath the surface? Who else can endear himself as an unlikely hero who tries to atone and clean up crime in the big, bad city but Tobey Maguire and his innocent, expressive eyes?Obviously, the Spider-Man movies are going to have great special effects and thrilling action sequences. Whether he's battling the Green Goblin or merely testing out his new flying powers, you're in for a great, fun ride.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spider-Man flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","

"Spider-Man","kevin_robbins","16 September 2023","My daughter and I recently enjoyed watching Spider-Man (2002) on Netflix. The story revolves around Peter Parker, who lives with his aunt and uncle and secretly harbors a crush on his neighbor, Mary Jane, believing she doesn't notice him. However, when Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider during a class field trip, he gains superpowers that could finally catch Mary Jane's attention. Simultaneously, his best friend's growing animosity towards his father sets the stage for a potential super villain's emergence.Directed by the iconic Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead), the film features a stellar cast, including Tobey Maguire (The Great Gatsby), Kirsten Dunst (Melancholia), Willem Dafoe (Platoon), James Franco (127 Hours), Cliff Robertson (Escape from the Condor), Rosemary Harris (Before the Devil knows You're Dead) and J. K. Simmons (Juno).Spider-Man boasts a perfectly cast ensemble that excels in portraying the relationships within Spider-Man's universe. The circumstances leading to Uncle Ben's tragic demise, the rise of the Green Goblin, and Peter's relationship with Mary Jane are all beautifully depicted. Kirsten Dunst shines as the quintessential girl next door, despite some peculiar wigs, and the action sequences are nothing short of tremendous. The Macy's Day parade battle is a standout moment, and every web-swinging scene deserves a 10/10 rating. The CGI and soundtrack are top-notch, and who can resist a Bruce Campbell cameo? My only gripe lies with the Green Goblin suit, which falls short of the character's potential, despite Willem Dafoe's excellent portrayal as the villain.In conclusion, Spider-Man is a true gem in the superhero genre, deserving of its royalty status. I would give it a solid 9/10 and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an action-packed and emotionally engaging cinematic experience.","

"Spider-Man","CuriosityKilledShawn","29 April 2004","As a fan of Spiderman I was deeply let down by this stupid, gaudy, 'Hollywood' movie version. There are so many things wrong with it I could go on for ages.First of all, it's HORRIBLY miscast. Tobey Maguire is NO Peter Parker, he is so completely wrong for the part. Jake Gyllenhaal could have been much better. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson seemed like a typical studio-exec choice. Instead of finding someone who could actually be a model/actress with a statuesque figure, real auburn hair with green eyes who could bring some integrity to the part we have ' the hottie from Bring It On who all the teenage guys like'. I personally do not find her attractive and her part in the movie is no more than 'the damsel in distress when necessary to the plot' kind. She's such a stronger character in the comic book and it's been totally ignored here. James Franco as Harry Osborne was useless. I've seen more charismatic performances from furniture. Willem Dafoe was okay as the Green Goblin but some of his dialogue was real bad, it felt like rejected Skeletor jibes from the original He-Man show. He did provoke some sympathy and coped well with the inner-turmoil story but I could not help but think that someone else could have done it better. JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell were the only bright spots among the whole cast.27-year-old Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker. A 'boy' who is blessed with web-spinning capabilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip. You guessed it, this is another 'origins of' story. I HATE it when comic-book superhero movies feel the need to do this. Honestly, who DOESN'T know who Spiderman is or how he got his powers? The fact that Spiderman is so popular (as a franchise) is the only reason this tawdry-looking movie was a hit. I would have had so much more respect for it if it went straight to the action and didn't waste time setting things up. No superhero movie is willing to do this and it only proves even further that Spiderman was cooked up and packaged in board room meetings.
As a way of disguising the fact that the whole thing is no more than processed cheese, eccentric director Sam Raimi was hired to direct. Known for his cheap but whacky movies Raimi had never really done anything big budget before this. The result is a meretricious, mess of a movie that is all over the place. I honestly thought I had walked into some Power Rangers movie.The computer effects are, quite simply, hideous. Who are they honestly trying to fool with this stuff? It boggles the mind how they ended up with an Academy Award nomination. They are really, really bad. The Styrofoam shark in Jaws: The Revenge was more convincing.Danny Elfman cranks out YET ANOTHER superhero movie score for this 'un. It's flat, boring and unimpressive. Aunt May is way too old. The Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger. The direction is uncontrolled. It's got a poor cast. The story is nothing new or daring (check out the comic books for that). It's assembled by a boardroom committee, not crafted by people who care and it's just loud, dumb entertainment when Spiderman really should be much more.The only part I appreciated was the way they made Spiderman's web biological instead of manufactured. It just makes so much more sense this way. Though there are loads out there who disagree with me.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (I seriously think this film would have benefited from and deserved scope-widescreen but no luck) and it looks better than average. There are some color problems and it doesn't look too crisp. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is typically loud and thumping but it's nothing particularly dynamic. There are quite a few extras if you're really that much of a fan. As I couldn't care any less for this film I can't comment.","

"Spider-Man","CinemaSerf","3 September 2023","Tobey Maguire was always going to have a tough task revitalising this franchise - but I think he has done a decent job here. The geeky, shy, young ""Peter Parker"" bitten by a genetically-modified spider that endows him with superhuman powers, decides to use his newly-found prowess for good. Dressed only in a pair of loosely converted pyjamas, he polices the streets at night apprehending thugs and petty criminals whilst during the day he remains the butt of jokes and pranks at school - usually at the hands of school heart-throb/dim-wit ""Flash"" (Joe Manganiello). He is best friends with ""Harry"" (the handsome, but pretty ineffective James Franco) who is not only the son of mega-rich scientist ""Norman Osborn"" (Willem Dafoe) but who is also dating his own dream girl ""Mary Jane"" (Kirsten Dunst). When his board try to take the ""Osborn"" company away from him, Dafoe starts experimenting with drugs that transfer him from a megalomanic scientist into - well a megalomanic ""Green Goblin"" - and it falls to ""Spidey"" to save the city and, of course, get his gal. Maguire is engaging in this, he has a glint in his eye and he enters into the spirit of this light-hearted fantasy adventure well. The writing is good in places, if a little too earnest at times, and the visual effects work well. They don't overwhelm the acting - maybe because the spider skills are inherently a little less showy - and this allows the story to focus more on a few engaging characterisations. JK Simmons is good as newspaper editor ""Jameson"" and there are a few nice cameos scenes from Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as his uncle and aunt. Sam Raimi has kept the pace tight, there is plenty of action peppered with some humour, some ham from Dafoe and a decent amount of scary science to keep this moving along well for two hours.","

"Spider-Man","tfrizzell","26 June 2002","Very good superhero film that competes very well with the first two ""Superman"" films and the first ""Batman"" from 1989. High school senior Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bit one day at a museum by a genetically-enhanced spider and his super powers are born. Meanwhile the very wealthy Willem Dafoe has performed a risky experiment on himself at his research lab and turns himself into a crazed maniac, with super-human strength, who only cares about world domination. Of course there is also Spider-Man's love interest (Kirsten Dunst), his elderly uncle and aunt (Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris) and his best friend who is also Dafoe's only son (James Franco in another outstanding performance for the youngster who has unlimited potential). Franco appears to become much more important in upcoming ""Spider-Man"" films. Let's start predicting how many films the franchise will produce. 4 stars out of 5.","

"Spider-Man","Pjtaylor-96-138044","14 February 2018","Sure, at times 'Spider-Man (2002)' is a little cheesy and perhaps even border-line camp, but this is big-budget blockbuster film-making with flair. Sam Raimi's distinct directing style is present and appreciated, even if it is reined in a little. It brings to life a colourful comic-book world in a believable, entertaining way and it's much better than the washed-out, generic stuff we so often see nowadays. The piece can be melodramatic on occasion but it also isn't afraid to get dark, with some sequences actually being pretty brutal (I'll refer you to the final fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, whose defeat is wince-inducing to say the least) and highlighting the dangers of the occupation well, while never losing sight of the heart of the character. The flick is incredibly well-made and, for me, still holds up. It's a true highlight of the genre; a blast from start to finish. 9/10","

"Spider-Man","snoozejonc","18 April 2022","Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' is a strong origin movie for the famous superhero.The story packs quite a lot into its running time, with background stories to several characters whilst developing a fairly good confrontation between protagonist and antagonist.How Peter Parker becomes the titular hero is exceptionally well done and this transformation links well to themes of adolescence and transition into adulthood. The dialogue exchanges with his family are some of the standout moments for me.The scenes between Parker/Spidey and MJ are some of the best exchanges between romantically linked characters in the superhero genre. Both dialogue and visuals are wonderful, with Kirstin Dunst and Toby Maguire having great chemistry.For me the weakest aspect is the writing and design of the Green Goblin. Willem Dafoe, as always, gives a fantastic performance, and Sam Raimi makes the best out of the concept, but there is a pretty weak and rushed backstory and the costume does not work on screen. I do though like the surrogate father aspect of the character.I think the visual storytelling is strong, with great cinematography, editing and special effects. Some of it seems a bit cartoonish by today's standards but at the time of release all the slinging and swinging was groundbreaking imagery.","

"Spider-Man","KineticSeoul","12 June 2016","This is a superhero movie that didn't try to get all gritty, serious and full of twist and turns to make it a engaging superhero movie. Instead it's a friendly superhero movie that is just overall fun to watch. Plus there weren't many superhero movies like this, so the audiences were just blown away watching Spidey swing around New York. Yeah, the plot is generic and the CGI is outdated in today's standards but it was a great movie when it came out. I remember first seeing the trailer for this movie and was just amazed by it. Since at that time I have never seen anything like this, despite it leaning toward the cheesy side in today's standards. Spider-Man was my favorite superhero at that time. So as a kid I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end and wanted to see it again once it was finished. I am not sure if Tobey Maguire was the best choice for the role as Peter Parker. But he played his character as a likable and nice science nerd. Although not as snappy and taunting as Spider-Man but he was believable as a nerd with the heart of gold. This movie doesn't pull much punches, but it has enough of Spider- Man in it with a story-line that for the most part follows through. Despite it not being very accurate to the comics, it does carry on the essence of Spider-Man. I even liked the theme song, despite few very cheesy scores but the theme song by Danny Elfman is spot on. Overall this is a fun and friendly superhero movie worth checking out.8.4/10","

"Spider-Man","Robert_duder","8 May 2002","I was anxiously awaiting this movie. I expected high flying action, good fun, and a decent movie. What met me was three times that!! Sam Raimi blew me away with what is probably the best Super Hero film ever made. It wasn't dark, but it wasn't light-hearted, the phenomenal thing about this movie was that it was real. The world around Peter Parker and Spiderman was our world. Raimi did not ""Comic Book-ize"" the world like they did for Batman or Superman movies. It was our world, it was like looking right out our front windows. Tobey Maquire was the ideal choice for the run of the mill kid, who is picked on and misunderstood and pining for the beautiful popular girl. The popular girl is played by Kirsten Dunst who we know can look like a goddess or in this case, truly, actually look like the girl next door. Raimi is brilliant...this movie was filmed in what I call real-life. He took a fantasy about a kid bit by a spider and brought Spiderman into the real world. Maguire and Dunst both look like the average kid and I don't think a lot of make up was used to cover their imperfections and blemishes. Instead Raimi allowed them to look like human beings. The story for Spiderman follows true to the comics. Peter Parker, while on a school trip is bit by a genetically altered Spider and wakes up the next morning, stronger, faster, healthier, with enhanced...well everything. Immediately thinking of his own personal gain, Parker uses his powers to take on a wrestler and when he's cheated by the wrestling promoter he gets even by allowing a crook to rob the Promoter. Moments later Parker discovers that by letting that crook get away his beloved Uncle Ben (who is like Peter's father) is murdered by that crook. From that moment on Peter Parker vows to fight injustice with the words of Uncle Ben ringing in his ears...""with great power, comes great responsibility."" This movie spans the course of several years in Peter's life and Raimi covers that whole time without making us feel rushed or crammed together...instead it flows together, and leaves us riveted to the screen. Franco and Dafoe play Father and Son, and Dafoe during a experiment loses his mind and his personality is split into the Green Goblin who uses top secret Military technology to destroy the city. Dafoe is just brilliant as the evil Green Goblin and his alter ego, the suave Dr. Osbourn. Franco who plays Harry Osbourn, Peter Parker's best friend looks and acts so much like Dafoe that they are the most believable father and son in movies in years. The story is so depthy and full of emotion and action. The computer generated effects at times are almost cartoonish which I always HATE but Raimi uses enough effects mixed with live action that it flows well and you don't notice the computerized Spiderman nearly as much. Spiderman himself is also amazing as he should be. The costume and Maquire playing him make him the greatest hero on screen in years. This movie is so fantastic because it is so SIMPLISTIC!! It's like you're watching right down town Hometown. I honestly don't know if Raimi could pull off a sequel with the same quite subtlty and simplicity but I would love to see him try. I would pay the 10 bucks to not only see a sequel but I would even love to see Spiderman again. The running time was the better part of two hours and it was the perfect length. Everything about this movie was just enough of everything. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! This is the great Blockbuster for the summer!!! 9/10","

"Spider-Man","IonicBreezeMachine","31 December 2021","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy and meek high schooler who is often the object of casual abuse and teasing by most of the school. Peter has a crush on ""girl next door"" Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but doesn't act on it out of fear of rejection leaving his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), to develop a relationship with her instead. On a field trip to Columbia University Peter is bitten by a genetically engineered Spider and gradually manifests physical changes such as enhanced strength, heightened alertness, ability to cling to walls and ceilings, and shooting webbing from his wrists. Peter initially uses these powers for personal gain, but following the death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) that Peter feels indirectly responsible for, Peter becomes the masked hero Spider-Man while also attending classes and working part time taking pictures of his Spider-Man persona to sell to abrasive tabloid newspaper owner/editor J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) to help alleviate the financial strain on his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). Meanwhile, Harry's father, scientist/CEO Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) under intense pressure from imminent loss of a lucrative military contract to a rival company decides to test a dangerous enhancement formula on himself which works but unleashes a dangerous split personality in the Green Goblin.One of Marvel Comics most iconic and beloved characters, Spider-Man has seen various incarnations in other media since the 60s with notable animated and live action adaptations on TV. Attempts had been made at bringing the character to feature film since the 80s with attempts by Roger Corman, Cannon Films, Carolco, James Cameron and even MGM being stalled for various reasons be they creative or financial until the rights were eventually obtained by Sony following an agreement with MGM regarding disputed rights to the James Bond novels Casino Royale and Thunderball (long story there). A number of directors were considered including Tim Burton, David Fincher, Michael Bay and many others until Amy Pascal's championed pick of Sam Raimi was hired primarily from his enthusiasm for the character stemming from the directors childhood fandom having read the early Stan Lee and Steve Ditko era comics of the Silver Age. When the movie was released in May of 2002, Spider-Man became the first film to have a $100 million opening weekend and made over $800 million worldwide becoming the third highest grossing film of 2002 with only Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets beating it. The movie is seen as one of the first major events that ushered in most what defined the early 2000s take on the Superhero genre (along with the X-Men movies) and while the film has definitely aged, it's a charming film in its own right that shows a real love for the character.Tobey Maguire is really good playing Peter Parker with his nerd mannerisms being reminiscent of Rick Moranis' take on Seymour from Little Shop of Horrors in terms of delivery. While it's admittedly a broad performance it works well for the type of world and tone the movie strives towards (more on that). Kirsten Dunst is also good as Peter's friend/love interest Mary Jane Watson as is James Franco as Peter's best friend harry Osborn and the three play off each other quite nicely giving a strong sense of camaraderie to their interactions. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are also good as Uncle Ben and Aunt May respectively with some really good moments between Maguire and Robertson and Harris giving us that warm familial dynamic that resonates strongly with us. Willem Dafoe is also quite good as Norman Osborn and is quite chilling in his normal guise as a shrewd and aggressive businessman but is also bursting with scenery chewing enthusiasm when adopting the Green Goblin persona. But by far the best part bar none is J. K. Simmons as Daily Bugle editor/owner J. Jonah Jameson whose fast talking tightly wound delivery and persona make him one of the most endearing and entertaining staples of the movie.Because the technology used for Spider-Man swinging through the city and performing elaborate acrobatics was still in its infancy, the movie's effects have not aged gracefully and there's a number of scenes that are often rubbery or lacking in weight. The visual effects for the movie were handled by industry veteran John Dykstra who helped bring the space battles of Star Wars to life so he's a quality talent to have on a project likes this, but the technology and effects were very rough around this time with Raimi mostly used to practical effects rather than digital ones and the effects for Spider-Man were a level above what had been attempted with CGI especially regarding superhero movies. There's also some noticeable gaffes in editing that make flow confusing or make a scene feel sloppy but these are mostly forgivable. But the biggest sticking point will be the movie's tone and delivery which has a goofiness to it because the movie maybe adheres a little too closely to the comics it bases itself upon. While the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era of Spider-Man comics are regarded as classics for good reason, they were also written in the 1960s during the Silver Age of comics wherein storytelling was very compressed and dialogue was overly blunt and direct lacking in polish or nuance. The story structure of Spider-Man is perfect with the pacing well done with everything established efficiently and effectively while telling a satisfying story with a strong emotional core. However the dialogue is filled with little ""quirks"" that feel like they're taking that Silver Age style of writing that comes off as a little eye brow raising especially in modern day and live action.Spider-Man may be a little dated in some aspects, but it's a film that exudes passion and love for the characters and the comic with clear effort made by people who believed in the core of Spider-Man. The movie served as the template for many superhero films of the early 2000s and its influence can still be felt on later superhero movies thanks to the foundations established by Sam Raimi and Spider-Man.","

"Spider-Man","leplatypus","1 January 2005","Reviewing Spiderman makes me learn about a few simple rules about critics: # 1. Critics are subjective, because it is the result between The story and Our story. So Spiderman being my first big moment of entertainment in my childhood, its movie could only be viewed with tolerant eyes.# 2. Adaptation is a success if the Â«spiritÂ» of the work has been understands. Thus, the pleasure for the fan is to live again this spirit, in front of a lot of little differences from the original work. In Spiderman, the spirit is indeed there: a loyal nephew and friend, a torn soul between his dreams and his duties. And the cast embodies perfectly the characters.# 3. The key to evaluate an adaptation is that not only the fans loves it but also the new comers. And I have got 2 friends who likes Spiderman whereas they didn't even read comics !!!! So, if the Xmen is too complicated for the non-initiated, if Superman is too perfect, if Batman is too dark, Spidey is really the Number one of the super heroes in comics and in movies!!!","

"Spider-Man","vengeance20","9 December 2022","Saw this one VHS back when I was a boy & remember how ace it was seeing this!The film sees Peter Parker, a nerdy student who on a field trip to Oscorp Industries, gets bitten by a venomous genetically enhanced spider & develops spider like powers to which he fights evil, in New York & a vengeful enemy named The Green Goblin!I found this film to be pretty good! It's a to the point action super hero film that is done right, which sadly can't be said for similar films now which have to be too long, too convoluted, too sci-fi & just passionless!The story is pretty good & straight forward & the villain is also a great too! The pacing is good for a nearly 2 hour film which does what it sets out to be! Tobey McGuire knocks it pout the park as Peter Parker & is by far my favourite spider man to date!The film has some sad moments in it too which are balanced out by the action & romance scenes with Mary-Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst & the villain Green Goblin, played by William Dafoe! Then there's the comedy sequences with J. Jonah Jameson played by J. K Simmons! Then of course you have Cliff Robertson & Rosemary Harris playing Ben Parker & Aunt May along with Peters' best mate Harry Osborn being played by James Franco!Overall, it's a truly classic early 00's super hero action film which beats all others in this day & age 20 years on! Honestly, this raised the bar & couldn't be matched since!8/10.","

"Spider-Man","Quinoa1984","25 May 2002","Sam Raimi to me didn't seem like not the wrong choice to direct Spiderman but the un-needed choice- at least at first. The screenplay would've fit any director whose a fan of Spiderman since it entails most of the clichÃ©s and knowledge that goes into a comic book adaptation. But after repeat viewings, and seeing Spider-Man 2 more as well, I've grown some more respect for a picture that I thought of at first as being as nothing more than something of Raimi going 'mega Hollywood' in telling the origin of Peter Parker. In this first installment, he fights the Green Goblin played by Willem Dafoe in a dual personality type role with Norman Osborne. Watching the movie, I liked the set up parts and the connection between Maguire and Dunst is there, but on the outset when I saw it early on I was not so much a fan of the action sequences, which compared to Raimi's grittier (and funnier to be sure) Evil Dead movies, are so fabricated they might as well have credited Pixar as one of the production companies. The work though shows a little better once settled further into the Parker saga, and the real skills come through better. And compared to others that have come out in more recent years, it is exciting in ways other action set pieces from other comic book movies aren't. I even dig the performances more too, especially Willem Dafoe as Osbourne/Green Goblin, who puts as much gnarly relish into his performance that it ranks up there with his best work. Maybe part of it too is accepting Maguire as Parker/Spiderman, as he has an awkwardness early on that's uncanny. But it fits, and it perhaps grows in the sequel(s), and seeing it again I appreciate what he's doing in the character. In short, it's fun, and that's all we can really ask for. B+","

"Spider-Man","moonspinner55","27 August 2002","I know popcorn-epics like ""Spider-Man"" can't dwell over every little detail, but director Sam Raimi is so hectic and insistent on pushing this thing along, he loses the narrative punch in the F/X muddle. The movie is a big, loud, dumb entertainment, colorful on a certain level and lots of fun at the beginning--revealing a sneaky sense of humor--yet it becomes more staid and familiar as it progresses. Yes, Spider-Man is a super-hero and we need to see him using his powers for the good of the nation, but Raimi loses the beguiling magic inherent at the beginning while constantly pushing forward with 'bigger and better' ideas. The obligatory hammy performances are here, but Tobey Maguire is curiously low-keyed and oddly charming in the lead. **1/2 from ****","

"Spider-Man","MinorityReporter","12 August 2005","Being an avid fan of the comic book I really looked forward to this movie and for a long time I convinced myself that I liked the film. However, after a long time of self denial I bought the Spider-Man DVD and I saw the film for what it truly was. A disappointment. The magic from the comic books had evaporated.The acting in the film is a mixed bag. Tobey Maguire is well cast but his overall acting and presence isn't very good. He does the nerd part very well but when it comes to being a super hero he falls short. Spider-Man was always a complex character with great internal struggles but the film medium doesn't convey this very well because we don't get the inner monologue that Spider-Man is so well known for. He therefore has to act with facial expressions and body language. Tobey has a pretty well defined body language but his facial expressions are somewhat lacking. Also the fact that he is wearing the Spider-Man suit in many scenes prevent us from clearly reading what is going on in his head at the moment. Kirsten Dunst is just miscast. She is a horrible actress with zero talent and no resemblance with the character she plays making her performance utterly unbelievable. Willem Dafoe is usually a brilliant actor but in Spider-Man he seems to have dumbed down quite a bit and although his schizophrenic scenes are pretty interesting they do not cover for the fact that this is Dafoe's most mediocre performance in years. James Franco who plays Harry Osborn is remarkably boring in his performance. His voice never seems to change making him a young Keanu Reeves. The most interesting and well cast actor is J.K. Simmons who plays J. Jonah Jameson and if there was ever a guy who looked like the character he is meant to play it is Simmons. This is in both looks, voice and presence.The overall effects in the movie are undoubtedly very good and this makes the action sequences seem more believable. Spider-Man was nominated for an Oscar in the effects department but deservedly the Oscar went to The Fellowship of the Ring because while the effects are good they are far from brilliant. I will even go as far as to say that the only really good effects scene is the one at the very end where Spider-Man swings through the city. This scene, however, almost saves the film because it is brilliant and it is the only scene I can watch again and again.Danny Elfman's score is very good and it really suiting for a super hero movie. It really shows that Elfman has done a super hero movie score before. I am of course referring to Batman which is undoubtedly one of the best scores ever and you can certainly feel that Elfman used some of the experiences from that film in Spider-Man. The score has an epic feel to it that suits the film very well. The music is beyond reproach.Where the film fails is in the fact that it is too proper and it feels too much like it was adapted for kids which is in my opinion a mistake because the film had tremendous potential but it seems wasted because it never really becomes an adult film. Also the ending on the bridge is based on a well known story in the Spider-Man mythology where Spider-Man's first love Gwen Stacy dies in Spider-Man's battle with Green Goblin. I think they should have brought on Gwen Stacy for the first film and then introduced Mary Jan in the second movie. because it would have given Spider-Man a greater sense of loss and a better reason to hate Green Goblin if his first love had died at his hands but instead Raimi plays it safe and has Spider-Man save both the children in the lift and Mary Jane. It just seems too stupid.All in all Spider-Man was not the movie I was hoping for. I expected the best film ever and it certainly didn't deliver. Having said that and having seen the film a couple of times on DVD now I have grown to appreciate it a bit more. My primary issue with the film is that seems that the film wasn't directed for the fans of the character who expected a better adaptation but instead the film becomes a main stream Blockbuster with a wide range which isn't necessarily a bad thing but being a hardcore Spider-Man fan I would have liked to see a more adult film. Spider-Man is a good effort though and the effects alone deserve to be watched.7/10","

"Spider-Man","richard.fuller1","2 June 2002","My brothers and I never could figure out why so much was changed for the Spiderman tv show back in the seventies. Why does it seem to take a good forty years before an at least honest, faithful version to the original tale can be accomplished?Yes, some things were changed from the comic book, such as Mary Jane Watson and Flash did not go to the science exhibit (Mary Jane wasn't even in the origin back in '62) and Peter didn't create his web shooters, but now shot them straight from his hands. The wrestling match, crook at the elevator and Uncle Ben's death were all incredibly condensed together. As my brother put it, it was 200 comic book issues in one movie. But changes do take place for movies (it will be very amusing for adults to explain why Billy Dee Williams turns into Tommy Lee Jones in the Batman movies).A movie is only capable of showing so much before it becomes too long. Aunt May and J. Jonah Jameson had both been terrorized by villians, so naturally they were each attacked by the Goblin, staying true to the comic books in that regard. Major kudos to the man, J. K. Simmons, for his depiction of J. JOnah Jameson. Peter Parker became Spiderman in high school, so I had no problem with him being young again. If he aged naturally in the comic book, he would be ready for retirement now. Already the Green Goblin's arrival at the banquet is being compared to the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz. And keep an eye out for an elderly gentleman with a white moustache and glasses in crowd shots with a small girl. It's none other than Stan ""the Man"" Lee himself.The movie itself made for a nice teen hero flick, the ending as to what Peter was exactly trying to say was vague (I got the impression it was striving for a Bill Bixby/HUlk bit), but this was a good flick. As long as the upcoming Daredevil and Hulk movies remain true to the origins too, there should be no problem there, but I don't see how Dr. Banner is gonna have his nuclear testing go awry when Rick Jones shows up on the field.","

There is so much to love: action, drama and romance, topped off by great special effects and above-average acting.The casting of Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst was inspired. Their chemistry as Peter Parker and Mary-Jane Watson jumps off the screen it's that good. Their kiss in the rain surely has to be one of the most iconic kisses in film history?Maguire is a great Spider-Man, and his performance is matched by that of Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin. I feel sorry for Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland having to follow in Maguire's footsteps.James Franco's scenes were good, but he was sparingly used as Harry Osborn in this instalment, though the final scene suggests this will change. And how great is Rosemary Harris as Aunt May? Also loved J. K. Simmons' handful of scenes as the irascible almost madcap Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson.Fantastic movie all around.

"Spider-Man","alexanderdavies-99382","1 July 2017","This was the film that proved an adaptation of a ""Marvel Comic"" superhero could be made. This first ""Spiderman"" film was the first of its kind and set the course for all future superhero movies. There is a story that actually holds the film together and backed by some good dialogue, good directing and pretty good acting. Where better than to begin with the origins of Spiderman? As has been depicted many times, high school student Peter Parker is bitten by a spider that just happens to be radioactive during a guided tour of a New York science museum. Initially overcome by his newly acquired superpowers, Parker attempts to cash in by appearing as a wrestler and on prime time television. After all this is met with failure, disaster strikes as Parkers Uncle Ben is murdered in cold blood by a thief. Cliff Robertson was brilliantly cast as the uncle. The story doesn't just revolve around Spiderman/Peter Parker though. Elsewhere in the film, business tycoon and inventor Norman Osborn (well played by Willam Defoe), suffers from an accident in his own laboratory after an experiment goes wrong. Thus the Green Goblin is unleashed. I was a bit disappointed with the costume for the Green Goblin, it held none of the appeal or chilling factor that the comic books had. Peter Parker struggles with his growing feelings for the girl that he has liked since childhood - Mary Jane Watson. The task of expressing his feelings has been rendered even more difficult on account of his crime- fighting alter ego. Toby Maguire is pretty good in the main role but I wouldn't exactly call him a heavyweight actor. He can't project the rugged look that action men need. Even so, he fits the bill. The scenes that show Spiderman web-slinging his way around New York look great and the CGI serves its purpose without compromising the story. A great film and its box office success is well deserved.","

I've been thinking they should make it for YEARS. It compliments the comic very nicely, without the darkness some other comic-to-movie films have had in the past(Batman sequels -I thought the first Batman with M. Keaton had the perfect dark tough of Gotham City, so I do like the darkness in Bman 1). Tobey Maguire, I had my doubts about as Spider Man at first, but now I realize it great for the role. As was everyone else(hats off to Willem Defoe, perfectly portryaying the ever creepy Green Goblin). Although sometimes the graphics were a bit corny, and at a few scenes, I got a Power Rangers feeling when they weren't using graphics in a scene between G-goblin and Spiderman, just looking at them in the cheesy suits looked like something out of Power Rangers. However, this happened noly around 2 times in the film, and it wasn't a biggy. I loved Spider-Man and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can snatch it in my web.4/5 stars-MovieCritc2003","

"Spider-Man","PCC0921","22 July 2022","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), like Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000), owes a lot to Tim Burton's Batman (1989). Those reasons are obvious and don't even need to be pointed out, but also for music composer Danny Elfman. Danny Elfman revolutionized the comic book soundtrack when he did Batman (1989). At the same time, the Simpsons (1989-present), started airing on FOX, with his legendary theme song, thus sealing his style of music into the pop-culture conscience. It doesn't stop there. In the 13 years between the two movies, Elfman would eventually do Edward Scissorhands (1990), Mission Impossible (1996) and Men in Black (1997), just to name a few. It is Elfman's music that catapults this film right out of the gate with the beginning credits, totally channeling, but not copying, the music from Batman (1989).From there, Sam Raimi finally gives web-head his cinematic due, by showing the world, that a man can walk on walls. With a huge budget, an excellent cast and the best special effects available for 2002, this film became part of the new millennium's superhero, comic book, film momentum, that paved the way to the MCU of today. This film appealed to the general public, as well as the comic book fans. Sam Raimi had captured a spark, which would spread even more in the sequel, Spider-Man 2 (2004), which is even better than this one. This film should still be viewed first, always, before watching the sequel. It needs to be, because of its importance to film. Not just for its importance to the comic-book film, but it also played a huge part in film history as well. You can skip Spider-Man 3 (2007), if you want to.8.7 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.","

Except the superhero and scifi part everything is so real. The love, the science, the friendship, the family, the business.

"Spider-Man","ivo-cobra8","19 October 2015","Spider-Man (2002) it is an epic Sam Raimi Action superhero flick! This first Spider-Man film become my favorite film of superheroes. I remember when this film come out in 2002 and become a huge hit that year. I kept watching and listening video spot Hero - by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott. I wanted to see so badly that film that I bag my neighbor to get me that film and he did I watch it on Computer the same year that this film come out. And I love this film I love it not as much as I love Spider-Man 2 (2004) and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) but I still love it. I am glad they made this film in 2002 and Sam Raimi directed this film. I love it and it is my favorite best Spider-Man movie yet. I watch it in 2003 my mom bought me VHS when she was still alive, she isn't anymore it remind on my teenage years in high school. I watch it yesterday and I still can't get bored with it. Green Goblin was the best villain ever in Spider-Man I love him. The Amazing Spider-Man was really awesome I love it so much. I love them all Spider-Man movies.I still find the original enjoyable, but I'm not nearly as forgiving of its flaws as some are. I think Spider-Man 2 was great, but the first one really is... crappy. I get it that it appeals to people by ""capturing that exciting comic book feeling"", but that isn't enough for me to say it's a good movie. The new movie has stronger emotion and had more weight to it, and I was RELIEVED that the ending was different. Yeah, it was a selfish thing on the new Peter's part, but I forgive him for it. A marvel movie shouldn't really go to much into the origin unless it relates to the story of the rest of the movie, if the origin is connected to the actual plot, then it's appropriate to show it, if not, then it's something you can get done and over with in the first 10 minutes or so, this movie is a prime example, the goblin wasn't related to the origin, so it went by quickly.I love The Amazing Spider-Man a lot, but my favorite movie will always be Spider-Man 2002 I grow up with that movie. Spider-Man 2002 is much much better for me then The Amazing Spider-Man is. Fans who compare TASM over SM are just kids and maybe they watch TASM before they even hear about SM or who knows why they do that, everyone has their own opinion. I love Spider-Man 2002 equal the way I love The Amazing Spider-Man:P That is my opinion .Average teenager Peter Parker is transformed into an extraordinary super hero after he is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. When his beloved uncle is savagely murdered during a robbery, young Peter vows to use his powers to avenge his death. Deeming himself ""Spider-Man,"" he sets about ridding the streets of crime, bringing him into conflict with malevolent super-villain ""Green Goblin."" The action, acting and pacing are excellent and the movie manages to action, romance, drama and comedy all into one great package! Spidey has always been one of my favorites. I was surprised that Raimi was given the role of director with this film, considering his only real claim to fame is the Evil Dead series before this, but his direction here is very well done. The acting is very good. Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Everyone fits into their role well -- great cast. The special-effects are okay. Raimi can't seem to decide what scene should be CGI or which should be wires when it comes to the antics of Spidey saving the day or duking it out with a villain ""Green Goblin"".The musical score was only part of the success for this movie thanks to Danny Elfman. The special effects were mind blowing for me to see Spiderman swing from high buildings to catch the bad guys. This movie is worth every penny and it is worth owning. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson did a wonderful performance of her role. I seriously love the actress, I am a huge fan of her and I always was. She did played the character well, like the role of Mary Jane Watson was written on her skin.""With great power comes great responsibility."" Bottom of line I love this film and the fighting scenes between Spidey and The Green Goblin was awesome. CGI in this film wasn't bad It was great. The whole film was huge Entertainment.Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi.

"Spider-Man","alindsayal","23 December 2021","With Spider-Man: No Way Home set to come to cinemas in a couple of weeks and the reveal that characters from previous Spider-Man films will be a part of it, I thought I should go back and watch previous Spider-Man films and here is my review for the first Spider-Man film.Main Character
Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man here and he just fits the role really well and is really fun to watch. You see him grow from this really uncomfortable nervous nerd to this confident super hero and it is executed really well. Maguire, brings emotion and humour to the role to really create this interesting and sympathetic hero that you can really care about.Supporting Characters
Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin and he was literally born to play this role. He nails the duplicity of the role and the insanity that comes across from the Goblin, the costume isn't great but he is a very memorable villain for sure. Kirsten Dunst plays MJ and she does her job to the best of her abilities. The character isn't written very well and is basically a damsel in distress but I thought she had good chemistry with Maguire and it just about worked in this film. Similar with James Franco as Harry Osbourne, he isn't given that much to do but he is decent when on screen despite some of the plotting for the character not being that great in this film. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are both very good as Uncle Ben and Aunt May and you see the impact they have on Peter's life and how it moulds him as a superhero. Onto the show stealer which is JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson, when people ask what is the greatest casting in a comic book film he is the answer I give. He hasn't got a huge role in the film but when he is on screen he knocks it out of the park and is literally the only person who could ever play this role in live action.Story
The story is good, I think it is a really effective origin story for Spider-Man and really gets us invested in the character and moves at a quick enough pace that it never feels dull or slow. But this film does suffer a bit in their handling of some of the subplots, like the whole romance story. The characters of MJ and Harry are really underdeveloped and made to come across as bad people which doesn't make sense when the performers are really trying their best.Script
The script is effective, it is funny at times and the drama mostly works. You care about the main conflict and Spider-Man which is the most important part of the film. But there is no denying that some of the writing is incredibly cheesy and feels dated, making me cringe. Plus as I said some of the story elements just don't work.Style
The style of the film still holds up. The action scenes are very exciting and cinematic, I may have complained about the Goblin costume but the Spider-Man costume is amazing and so iconic. The film is paced really well and kept me interested and enjoyed throughout.Overall
Overall, Spider-Man is a great film. It is one of the superhero films that started the craze of these type of films and it still holds up really well.Rating - 8/10.","

"Spider-Man","dk777","12 February 2024","One of those films that managed to faithfully convey the characters from the comics.The casting is excellent, the characters resemble their counterparts from the comics, not only physically, but also in personality.Of course, it is never possible to transfer comics to film exactly the same, but this is an example of how it is possible to transfer characters from comics to the big screen almost identically.We follow Peter Parker and how he transformed from a scared boy into Spiderman. Tobey Maguire is excellent in the role of Peter Parker, but the rest of the actors are also great.The casting was excellent, the actors fit their roles and managed to portray the characters. Willem Dafoe is great as the Green Goblin, but J. K. Simmons stole the show with his unforgettable interpretation of J. Jonah Jameson. The direction is excellent.The film is really fun, with several good action sequences and does not burden the viewer with unimportant things, but wants to entertain him.Sam Raimi is a great director and he proves it here once again.This is a movie that wants to entertain us and succeeds in doing so.","

"Spider-Man","SkullScreamerReturns","27 September 2021","I liked this movie in the early 2000s and was surprised it's still very good this day. Especially, when the Avengers-related MCU movies have become a pain for me to watch it surprised me even more that Marvel movies used to be this good.There is of course action in this kind of movie, but the strength lies in the characters. It's a very good drama and love story. Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Mary Jane, Willem Dafoe is an excellent villain, the newspaper guy Jameson looks like just from a comic book, and, well, the whole movie with its beautifully framed shots and vibrant colors looks what a comic book movie should look like. Tobey Maguire is a good Peter Parker and makes a good dynamic with Dunst (though I also like Andrew Garfield's version of Parker a lot).Special effects are quite good. There is some cgi but it's not overused, and generally the movie looks good.One of the best superhero films? See it!","

It became a great classic of the superhero subgenre and is still a great movie today. Some things are dated and don't work as much as they used to and others weren't as good at the time, like the Green Goblin costume. However, this does not hinder anything, because the characters and the story are incredible and charming. Every frame of the film looks like it's been ripped from a comic book page. This film deserves to be forever a great classic.","

Let us, together, take a trip back in time 17 years ago, to when this gem hit the theaters. I have long been a Spider-man fan, from as far back as I can remember. He was my favorite part of the Electric Company when I was a kid. This was the best adaptation of the source material to have come out. They expertly captured the spirit that the hero embodies, including his quick whit. This movie fires on all cylinders, and the only reason it got a 9 is because I have see what the future holds for my man Peter Parker.","

Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man is everybody's favourite no matter what people say. And the second thing that I wanna say is The Green Goblin. If it wasn't for Green Goblin then this movie is just be average if it didn't have the powerful villain. Acting of all the actors are amazing specially the villain nailed it. Don't wanna say just relieve the era...","

"Spider-Man","Col-3","27 May 2002","Rarely do I feel as misanthropic as I do when I get home from a movie as bad as this one, and as popular as this one. Sure, it will fade by morning, but until then my dreams will be haunted be the ludicrous villainy, predictable action and motherhood-and-apple-pie cheese of Spider-Man. While Tobey MacGuire was an excellent choice, the whole movie was just lurching through the motions; there were no surprises, the whole thing felt paper-thin. Many cliches were strung together to lengthen the otherwise trivially simple plot - geek getting his own back against high-school bully, agonizing death scenes, and much puppy-dog romance which everyone else seems to have found adorable. I found it simply tedious. While the movie had some nice effects, it is, as one might expect, just another entry in a sad list of superhero flicks that are more or less indistinguishable from one another. Let me give you a hint: the good guy wins.","

"Spider-Man","bob the moo","27 June 2002","Peter Parker is a dorky kid going through adolescent changes.  However in his case they are changes brought on by a bite from a genetically enhanced spider.  In a difficult lesson Peter learns that his gifts bring him responsibility.  Meanwhile the father of Peter's friend, Norman Osborn is developing a hover platform and strength enhancers for the military.  When he faces losing the contract he takes the treatment himself Â– creating the Green Goblin, who wrecks havoc on the city Â– with only Spiderman able to stop him.With some comic adaptations the end results have been disappointing (The Punisher, most of the Batman films etc), however here this is one of recent successes including X-Men.  It may well make changes to the original legend but it's really only things that'll annoy geeks who spend too much time on the internet arguing over whether Iron Man could beat Batman in a fight! The plot has enough to it to distract.  The creation of both Spiderman and the Green Goblin are enjoyable over the first half.  Peter's `experimentations' in his bedroom can be taken any way you want it!  However when the Goblin and Spiderman being to battle it is nice and simple Â– there's no plot to take over the city, no plan to freeze the world or any silliness like that, it's a simple battle between a good guy and a baddie.In many bits the effects are surprisingly poor Â– not as bad as I thought they might be, but still bad.  There are many bits where the computer characters don't look real Â– not just in terms of their movement but more in terms of their looks, in places it doesn't even look as good as the computer game.  Having said that, for most they blend effects and live action together well.  The Goblin's suit doesn't match the comic and it looks a bit like something out of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, but they use it well although one scene with him does look like something out of Godzilla!The cast are actually what makes the film.  Maguire makes a good Spiderman Â– he's a goofy looking kid and a good actor.  He doesn't have Spiderman's one-liners but he makes a good character, even when he's behind the mask he manages to bring a certain amount of humanity to the role.  Dafoe ran the risk of losing credibility by being a serious actor who goes for the money and get dressed up in a monster suit for a FX movie!  However he is actually really good Â– you almost forget how silly it could have been.  There are some really good scenes where he's facing his alter ego and it could have been daft but he carries it off Â– shows what a good actor he is.  Dunst is good Â– she really isn't much more than a Louis Lane character but she is good and her character has a good background.  My favourite character is J. Jonah Jameson Â– he's exactly like he's meant to be and is very funny in a hyper sort of way!  The actor who plays him (J.K. Simmons) is probably best known for his role in Oz, the HBO series.  If you know him in that, then it's weird to see the actor who plays, well, basically the Devil, playing this type of thing Â– but hats off, he's really good and looks just like the comic book.  The support cast has some famous faces Â– like Bill Nunn, Ted Rami and a few others, and it's nice to see Rami's favourite actor Bruce Campbell in a small role.Overall I must admit I expected to be let down but, apart from dodgy effects this is a good summer movie.  Plenty of good action and fun but also good performances all round.  The only problem I see is that half this film was filled up with creating the characters Â– what will part 2 do to fill that time?","

Now coming back and watching it for my review and I have to say it's still good.Fine story with good pacing and really takes it's time introducing the plot and building up the atmosphere. The characters were pretty good and they went around in a circle showcasing them in unique and proper ways. They had good music composition and sound choices. The dialogue was not bad or good it felt standard. The visuals werent that bad or good it was alright though not impressed.Memorable: Yes . Rewatchable: No","

"Spider-Man","TechnicallyTwisted","7 May 2002","This is not the best comic book movie ever.  That honor still belongs to the first Superman.  I enjoyed the Peter Parker scenes, but felt let down by the action, and Danny Elfman's terrible score.  I didn't hate the film, there were moments that were quite good.  Like when Peter is first discovering his Spidey abilities.  But it didn't have that same mythic quality that the first Superman had.  The actors did there best with the script.  J.J Jameson was real good, but the story felt pedestrian.  The rivalry between the Goblin and Spider-Man wasn't developed enough.  I give the film a 7 because it was better than most of the summer blockbusters last year.  (Planet of the Apes anyone?)  But it was missing certain qualities that would have elevated it to classic status.  Go see it and decide for yourself though.","

"Spider-Man","NightmareOnElmStreetFan","8 February 2019","One of the most decent electrifying essential superhero's, the best origin story about a superhero Spider-Man - my personal favorite comic book superhero action movie. Spider-Man (2002) become a blockbuster hit in 2002 when it come out. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. I known Spider-Man character superhero from animated TV series of the 90's. As a teeneger I saw music video Hero by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott and I rushed to see this movie right away. A neighbor friend got me the movie on his comp and it was an adrenaline rush. This movie become my favorite superhero film of all time it still is. It defines my childhood. I watch this movie the first time as a teenager in a high school, it is a teenager dream.Spider-Man takes cues from Superman: The Movie (1978) which deals about superhero Clark Kent how he become Superman. Here is the origin story of how Peter Parker become from a shy nerdy teenager later photographer to a ultimate superhero of all time his alter ego Spider-Man. Just like Richard Donner directed the first Superman the excitement is here from MARVEL screenplay David Koepp created by Stan Lee R.I.P and Steve Ditko. I used to had VHS tape my mom bought me a present this movie, when I was a teen for my gradation day. I used too had the poster, but I don't know where that poster went too. I love this film to death my number 1 favorite Spider-Man film is Spider-Man: Homecoming but this Spider-Man the first in the trilogy is my second personal favorite Spidey film. I enjoy beautiful music score for Spider-Man from Danny Elfman, who also worked on a 1989 Batman music score. I love that music score to death.Directed was by Sam Raimi from ""The Evil Dead"" trilogy and stars: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco.The first film has humor, fast pacing, a lot of action, good sci-fi effects beautiful cast, good likable leads and good FX special effects. I love the CGI effects and custom for Spider-Man and Green Goblin. I heard that thieves stole Spider-Man suits on the production set that the crew make them for this movie. Mostly I understand the character Peter Parker it has deep sense meaning to the character. The first half deals more about how Peter is learning about his super ability when he gets bit by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". First he wants to impressed his neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the eternity love of his life by buying a car and he goes in to wrestling match to earn money. First half he was more selfish, shy and geek and he lost by a car jacking his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and when he didn't safe that carjacker who killed his uncle he was selfish. But he got redemption later in the movie and he learns that is not what he does. Spider-Man saved more kids than The Amazing Spider-Man Andrew Garfield did. Spider-Man saves Marry Jane. He saves a baby from a burning building. Spider-Man saves a trolley car on the Roosevelt Bridge witch are kids in it. On a parade in which Green Goblin starts attacking Spider-Man saves a kid when a balloon is falling at him, almost crushing him.You have action sequences in which Green Goblin on jet glider fires on Spider-Man rockets, and bullets, slugs at him but misses. He throws pumpkin bombs on the Board of Directors killing them, he throws razor bats on Spider-Man and cuts him. I love the fight sequence between Spider-Man and Green Goblin I love that on the end.Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man did a good excellent job playing his character. I like the actor he was excellent I really love his performance. Spider-Man was really the first film in the trilogy I saw. Kirsten Dunst was the best of the film as Mary Jane Watson. I love Kirsten she was my teen crush I loved her in Bring It On, The Crow: Salvation, Get Over It and The Virgin Suicides. I really, really miss the actress I grew up watching in Jumanji the actress, she was part of me growing up. James Franco as Harry Osborn was good I like the actor in a comedy Whatever It Takes he was good as Harry Osburn and a friend of Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn is a kick-ass actor he plays so many good roles that I enjoy. I love him in Platoon as Sergeant Elias, White Sands and John Wick he played John Wick's friend Marcus. So I love the guy I love his portrayal.Some Spider-Man fanboy told me that Spider-Man was stalking Mary Jane, it wasn't true. He saw Mary Jane running on the dark streets alone and he saw a muggers following her, so he went after her to help her out and rescuing her, he wasn't stalking her. She was his crush but he wasn't stalking her.In my opinion it is a decent electrifying essential action film of one of the best origin story's of a superhero becoming a Spider-Man. But I am hug fan of Tom Holland's Spider-Man: Homecoming so this Spider-Man is my second personal favorite film in the ""Spider-Man"" franchise that come out of all five films.","

"Spider-Man","cinephile-27690","6 April 2020","I like some superhero movies, but it's hard for me to love them. I have a few favorites(Spider Man 2 is my favorite thanks to Roger Ebert), but I have a tendency to not be thrilled by them.I like Tim Burton's Batman movies and Spider Man: Homecoming for instance, but I feel that overall are rather empty. By that, I mean they are good but I don't leave ""satisfied"", if that makes sense.Either the story is undermined and the action is overdone or I don't feel that the action is done right. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, for example, has many flaws and too much action in the last half hour.Because of this, I have only seen a handful of superhero movies. This was actually the first PG-13 movie I ever saw(At about 7 or 8), but I left it for many years and re-visited it when I was 19, nearly 2 years ago.As I got older, I could actually appreciate what Sam Raimi did with Spider Man's origin story. It takes about half the movie for Spider Man to show up, and until then we get to know Peter Parker as a human: a bullied nerd, close to his aunt and uncle, in love with his next door neighbor, etc. Even with spider powers, he is still a kid.That's one thing I enjoy about this movie, and especially the 2nd one. Sam Raimi takes a cartoony character and fleshes him out to make him relate-able.The action is exciting as well, since it comes in when it is necessary and it's not over-blown.There's nothing about the acting I can't complain about as well. Tobey Maguire is a great Spider-Man. He's fine in Sea biscuit and The Great Gatsby, but he's great in this. Willem Defoe is fantastic as The Green Goblin, a Mr. Hyde type character that becomes Spider Man's nemesis. That's his best role since Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ.Of course there are also the actresses Rosemary Harris and Kristen Dunst, and a young James Franco as well.What Spider Man therefore delivers is a fun plot, good action scenes and great acting performances, all balanced very well. The sequel is better, but this is still an excellent origin story that was very much worth telling.Note: This review was originally written on 4/16/19, and has been re-edited and re-posted. I intend to review Spider Man 2 and 3 next.","

"Spider-Man","kaden_lewis","23 December 2021","Before watching Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), I decided to re watch all the previous Spider-Man movies. However, I wanted to wait to review all the Spider-Man's until after I saw No Way Home so I could get a true rating. Every single Spider-Man movie was amazing, but this one was actually closer to the bottom. Don't get me wrong, this was an amazing movie. It was the original Spider-Man, the one that started it all, and was one of the movies that helped the super hero genre become popular. It was also the first super hero movie I ever watched. The first time I saw it, I was around 7 years old. My dad recommended it as a family movie night choice, and I loved it. I wanted to watch it over and over again. This is the movie I credit with starting my love for super hero movies.All aspects of the movie were also great. I thought they showed the origin story of Peter Parker very well with the spider bite, to his transformation, and the killing of uncle Ben. They just did a great job. I also liked how they decided on a very well known villain to start. Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin was the perfect story. I love him as a villain and I feel it played very well with the story. The transformation into the Green Goblin was also well done.The acting and casting decisions were also perfect. Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was great, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were great as MJ and Harry, uncle Ben and aunt May were portrayed great, J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious, and Willem Dafoe was unbelievable. I honestly believe he is one of the best super hero movie villains of all time. He was great.Lastly, I couldn't believe how good the graphics and effects were for 2002. They were great. I definitely recommend watching this movie. It was very well done, and it you are going to see No Way Home, watch all the Spider-Man movies if you have time. Trust me, I am glad I did.","

My other half has always been a fan and periodically has had me watch some of the MCU offerings. A couple were decent but most of what I've been shown made me wonder why anyone would support such no other word but crap. This early 2000's film on the other hand was very entertaining. I think everyone was well cast, the pacing of the film was good as I find during MCU films I watch the clock more, but this kept my interest. Willem Defoe was marvelous as green goblin as is Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. J. K Simmons added a special touch to the character of Jamison. Look forward to seeing part two.","

"Spider-Man","EddyTheMartian007","21 December 2018","Spiderman is one of the first CBMs I ever watched, and it was the movie which introduced me to Spiderman. After this movie I started to really like Spiderman. Anyways This Movie has surprisingly aged pretty well. There are some very goofy parts(like the bomb which turns people into skeletons), especially near the beginning, but for the most part this is a pretty solid movie.I think the beginning of the movie is probably the weakest, but as it progresses it does get much better. In the beginning of the movie we get the origins of both Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Norman Osborn (Willem Defoe) with both of them being a goofy in their own way. Peter being in a museum where one of 14 genetically modified spiders escapes and bites Peter, and possibly bites other people?! Also the Spider gives peter abs. Also peter doesn't tell anyone about getting bitten by a radioactive spider? I mean you'd probably die. We also get Green Goblin yelling like a madman when he very stupidly tests out the serum on himself. I thought the motivations were told well enough, but it was shown way to quick. The school bits with peter weren't very convincing, they didn't feel like an actual school, and when he figures out his powers it didn't really make sense logically, especially when he's jumping off of Buildings with some very outdated CGI. I do think Norman's descend into insanity was done very well.Once we get to Peter's relationship with Aunt May(Rosemary Harris), and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) (which are both great) the movie really picks up and gets much better. The dialogue between Uncle Ben and Peter is really good, and they feel like a family, and when the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" line is dropped it has a huge impact. The relationship is relatable to people who've lost someone. When Uncle Ben dies because of Peter ""revenge"" against the Wrestling Promoter, it's handled extremely well. Peter in some way caused his Uncle's death and Peter feels responsible. When Uncle Ben dies it's emotional and you feel the impact and dread it brings peter. He's once again filled with revenge trying to kill his supposed killer. Once again when he ""accidentally"" cause the killer to die peter realized what he has done, and then it hits him. ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"". Peter now realizes he should use he's powers for good, and thus Spiderman is born! Also he made his own suit somehow...Peter's Arc in the movie is one of the best parts of this film. Another great relationship is Harry (James Franco) and Norman Osborn. Harry is really good in this movie, Peter and Harry's friendship is established since the beginning and it's done well. There's a great Juxtaposition done with Peter and Uncle Ben's connection, compared to Harry's and Norman's connection. Uncle Ben was always kind and close to Peter while Norman is always cold and distant to Harry. It brews a good rivalry between Harry and Peter when Norman wants a son like Peter. The other character and one of the weaker ones, but still good enough is Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst). She unfortunately is the average Damsel in Distress. They try to give her some more character with having abusive parents, but it's never expanded on. Peter's and Her relations ship is kinda weird, it works better when it was Spiderman and MJ, but Peter feels kinda weird around her.I think Norman Osborn was a pretty good villain, his motivations make some sense, and he's insane so it's a bit more excusable. Willem Dafoe's performance was very enjoyable, and I think he brought some good character. The only real problem I have with him is the motivations against Spiderman aren't exactly too clear. Despite this I thought he was a pretty solid villain, and the 3rd act with him making Peter choose MJ or children was very good. The ending of Norman accidentally killing himself, and Peter revealing to Harry that he ""killed"" his father brings more rivalry for the future.
Overall I think this was a very good movie. I do have a few problems, like the beginning of the film. That really brought this movie down for me. Also it's kinda goofy in some areas, but when it's serious it hits. The rest of the movie is really good though, and to me this is the perfect example of a CBM origin movie.7/10","

"Spider-Man","Shmaden","12 December 2021","In preparation for Spider-Man No Way Home I decided to rewatch all the old Spider-Man movies starting with this one and ending with TASM 2. So let's get straight into the meat of this review and break this movie's plot down!Plot breakdown:The movie starts with what I can only describe as one of the best movie intros of all time. Not only the visuals are great and awesome at foreshadowing the characters in the movie mainly Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, it also has one of the best superhero movie themes of all time! It sets up perfectly the tone of this movie giving you the feeling of awe, drama, action, suspence and maturity above all. The latter is probably the thing most superhero movies today lack. But more on that later. The first scene perfectly establishes the character of Peter Parker having him run after a bus and barely getting on it courtesy of MJ. In about 5 minutes we learn more about this character than we found out about Tom Holland's Peter in maybe the first movie alltogether. We see Peter as slob, nerdy and socially incapable of having interactions with other people. And above all we see that even before he gets his superpowers his life sucked. That's a great way to build up your character by having him squashed again and again. We barely get to the Spider laboratory scene and we yet again see a moment in which Peter gets humiliated by both the movie and the characters in it. MJ starts looking at him and waves her hand towards him only to see that in fact she was waving her hand towards some of her friends coming from behind Peter. Than Harry Osborn gets introduced in another great introductory scene with his dad who seems not only very totalitarian towards him but also very cold and distant. Then Harry introduces Peter to Norman and after that we get the spider laboratory scene where Peter gets bullied again and at the end he gets bit by a spider. Simultaneously we see Norman getting a visit from the military general who gives him an ultimatum for human trial of his human enhancement serum. This sets him on his path to becoming the Green Goblin by having him test the serum on himself and going nuts. All the while Peter comes home and starts to transform into Spider-Man. He wakes up having big muscles and having no problem with his eye sight. There is also great humor in this scene as Peter slowly realises that a change has happened to him. No humor in this movie seems or feels forced or too much like in the MCU movies to the point in which half of it lands and the other half not. Anyway, Peter goes to school and starts talking with MJ from a distance while she can't hear a word he says only to lose the bus and see that his hands are becoming more sticky. Than at school he fires his first web and gets into a fight with Flash whom he totally beats down. Everyone gets away then from him and he runs in a dark alley where he climbs the walls for the first time. After that he tests his web slinging capabilities only to end up badly as he misses his appointment with his uncle to paint the kitchen. Then he takes out the trash and has a nice little talk with MJ which ends with Flash coming to get her in his new cool car. So, Peter decides to try get some money to buy a car to impress MJ. He designs his suit to go into a wrestling competition where if he could hang on 3 minutes in the ring with a pro wrestler he would win 3000$. The next day Norman is found passed out in his office by Harry and then one of his secretaries or whatever tells him that they found the scientist that helped him in his test last night dead and the equipment stolen. Back to Peter, uncle Ben drives him to the library where he said he was going. Then they have a nice talk about responsability which ends badly as Peter shouts he is not his father. Then he goes to the wrestling competition, beats up the fighter in a cage and gets only 100$. The boss then gets robbed and Peter lets the thief get away with the money. Then he finds his uncle shot down and doesn't even gets to say a proper goodbye to him. After finding out which way the robber is going he goes after him, does the web slinging thing for the first time which is so wonderful to see. He actually starts off slow and cautious to then get used to it and get better at it. The thief then has an accident while inside an old building with Peter questioning him about Ben's death and he falls off and dies. Then we see Quest aerospace's test thwarted by the Green Goblin and the scene switches marvelously to Peter's graduation. He then goes home and cries about uncle Ben who he would have liked to have arround at his graduation. He then takes up his painting of Spider-Man and we get the amazingly and also funny montage of Spider-Man encounters. Then we get introduced to one of the greatest legends in cinema of all time. It's JJ Jameson who tries to shine a bad light on Spider-Man. We then see MJ and Pete meet outside a restaurant or shop where we find out that MJ is in the pursuit of acting on stage and also now dating Harry. Speaking of him, Harry offers to help Pete find a job through his dad, to which Peter refuses and instead opts for becoming Spider-Man's photographer. It's so nice to see daily events like living together in an apartment and searching for a job being integrated so well into the story and tying into Spider-Man as a superhero. We never make a detour in this movie, even the slower paced moments are realistic and done in order to progress the story forwards. The movie flows so well as a result. We then see Peter getting a freelance with Daily Bugle and Norman getting the boot. Afterwards is the World Unity Festival which gets attacked by the Green Goblin. Everything ends in Spider-Man stopping him and saving MJ. Norman then talks to the Green Goblin and we dig deeper into his and Goblin's character. Afterwards JJ Jameson gets a visit from the Goblin and Spider-Man who gets sedated by some vapor Goblin releases in his face. Then they have a chat on rooftop in which Goblin proposes that Spidey joins him and become the most powerful people in the world. Then Pete runs into MJ again and then saves her from some thugs to have then the awesome reversed kiss. Then Spider-Man saves a baby from the fire and goes into it again to save an apparent women who is in fact the Goblin in disguise. Spider-Man gets hurt in the process which gives him up in front of Norman at the tanksgiving dinner which ends in a disaster. So, now the stage is set for the finale, and what a finale it is. The Goblin traumatises aunt May, and then kidnapps MJ and a bunch of kids. He then releases them both forcing Spidey to choose. Again emphasising the idea that with a responsibility we can't have and do everything we want. Such a great message. The movie ends with a battle between Spidey and Goblin. And I really love this fight because it really shows the lack of experience Spider-Man has at the beginning of his career of fighting crime. He barely wins through a combination of resilience and an accident which has the glider kill Norman. The movie ends with Norman's funeral and Peter refusing to be with MJ even though she just confessed her love for him. Again, stregthening the idea that with great power comes great responsibility and hence you can't have it all.End of plot Breakdown!What a wonderful and full of web slinging fun movie! I think the thing that impressed me the most in this viewing was the realism of these characters who are so well developed and flashed out that you end up caring just as much for the man under the mask as for the man with the mask. The humor is restrained and I would say more than 80% of it works and lands, unlike the newer MCU movies which insist with so much humor that at times it's hard to figure it out if the movie is an action/drama/adventure or a straight out comedy. This movie uses humor sparingly and with finese so that almost everytime it works. The action scenes are fantastically choreographed not to overly exagerated but rather more grounded and impactful giving the movie even more of a realism feeling. The music is another hit in this movie. The original score for this movie and the whole trilogy is quite simply legendary. So many awesome cues and themes that just enchance the movies experience. The acting is another winner in this movie. Everyone delivers at least a competent performance if not brilliant (Willem Defoe). Him as Norman Osborne and Green Goblin is simply mesmerizing. I couldn't take my eys of him in every scene he was in. He really gives Alfred Molina a run for his money. The next guy I wanna talk about is JJ Jameson (played brilliantly by J. K. Simmons). I mean it doesn't get any better than this. Wait, it actually does in Spider-Man 2. But as superhero movies are concerned before this movie came out I haven't seen a more charismatic performance from an actor ever in a superhero movie. What an absolute and complete legend this guy is! He was so legendary that MCU decided to recast him in the new Holland movies. It wouldn't be fair to point out only the great things this movie does and not pin point some flaws: like the chessy ending to the first fight between Goblin and Spidey or the Goblin's suit which at this point, 20 years later seems a bit goofy given that we saw more realistic superhero costumes in the MCU. Not to forget the cringy dialogue at some points which took me out of the scene a little. Having said that Spider-Man's costume is one of the most legendary superhero costumes in a superhero movie. All in all, a great movie, very realistic in its depiction of an actual superhero dealing with his double life in the real world and with a lot of heart and fun put into it. Not to forget the maturity showed by the characters in it, which so many new MCU movies lack for the sake of humor. Not to forget we owe it to movies like this one and Spider-Man 2 and 3 that MCU now exists. This movie paved the way for them. 10/10.","

"Spider-Man","bradykitchen-33648","29 August 2021","Acting in this was extremely well done in huge part because of the castings. Every actor looked like they were born into that role especially Tobey and Willam. Tobey is great as Peter and fits that role very well. Dafoe is nothing short of a menace.Action was great and surprisingly brutal at times which added a sense of realism. Sam Rami is great at creating tho sense of darkness while also keeping that sense of hope in the each scene.It took a little too long for the goblin and Spider-Man stories to intertwine not a huge issue but something to note.The goblins suit was very cheesy, took a little bit away from Willams performance.Overall great 8/10.","

"Spider-Man","DavidSim240183","4 April 2006","Although a huge Spider-Man fan, I must confess I've never read a single Spider-Man comic. Everything I know about the character comes from the cartoons. First the classic one with that song. Then the updated one from the 90's which took a more adult stance, and allowed us to get behind the masks and see the people inside. And now finally, Spider-Man gets the big budget treatment, given a distinctly absurdist spin by one of my favourite directors, Sam Raimi.Sam Raimi is a self-professed Spidey fan, and his enthusiasm for the character shines through warm and bright. Raimi has taken care to ensure the emotional core that always drew people to Spidey in the first place is still intact.The story begins on the day Peter Parker is changed into Spider-Man. Parker is a gawky teenager who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. He pines for the girl next door, Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He's friends with super rich Harry Osborn, the son of industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe).When Parker goes on a field trip to Columbia State University, he gets bitten by a radioactive spider, and is thus transformed. He can now shoot webbing from his wrists, he has superhuman strength and agility, and he can stick to walls.At the same time, Norman Osborn goes through a transformation of his own. Pressured by his superiors to perfect a new type of super suit, the experiment goes wrong (the film is admittedly a bit vague on this point) and Osborn is driven insane. With the new suit and a hi-tech glider, he becomes the Green Goblin, and sets out to grab power.Meanwhile, Peter's new-found abilities go to his head. He beats up the school bully, and gets off on the adrenaline rush. He feels he can now win the heart of Mary-Jane, but first he needs cash. He goes into wrestling, and there's a great scene where we see Peter try out new designs for an outfit. I got a genuine feeling of exhilaration when I saw the final Spider-Man suit.But Peter's odd behaviour hasn't gone unnoticed by Aunt May and Uncle Ben. In a very poignant scene, Ben tries to teach Peter about the dangers of power. Thankfully we still get the classic line ""With great power, comes great responsibility."" But Peter doesn't want to listen.When Peter goes into the wrestling ring, he comes out a winner. The wrestling promoter doesn't give him the money he wants, and is then robbed. But Peter makes no effort to stop him. Just for the sake of revenge. Peter's power trip has sent him sky high.And comes crashing down to Earth. Uncle Ben is killed, and in a fit of rage, Peter wants vengeance. Only to find the murderer is the same man who robbed the promoter. The man Peter let go. A man who ends up dead after going through a window. A man Peter doesn't try to save.Filled with remorse, Peter takes Ben's words of wisdom to heart, and puts his powers to good use. As the amazing Spider-Man.One thing that struck me about Spider-Man was how aptly cast it was. Tobey Maguire is pitch perfect as Peter Parker, finding the right amount of shy awkwardness and balancing it with teenage angst. But unfortunately, he seems a little lost in the Spidey suit. He never really comes alive.Kirsten Dunst is a fine actress most of the time, but spends half of it screaming as Mary-Jane. When she's not though, she makes an impression, displaying a touching vulnerability when her acting career goes nowhere.Willem Dafoe is suitably manic, but we never really get behind the Green Goblin's mask. Sam Raimi explored this territory to far greater effect in his earlier effort Darkman. Dafoe goes rather over the top, and his performance falls into clichÃ©. Still, there are some scenes involving the Green Goblin's psychosis I liked, such as the supremely eerie scene when Norman argues with himself in a mirror.James Franco is an insipid Harry Osborn. He walks around the film with a tortured puppy dog look that is very irritating. He is definitely the most shallow character in the film, and if truth be told, contributes nothing.Cliff Roberts and Rosemary Harris are great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. There is a lot of warmth to their characters, and they're utterly believable. But who could forget J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. He is 100% spot on in the part. Capturing everything. The mannerisms. Gruff voice. Temper tantrums. You perk up every time he's on the scene. It's just a pity he doesn't get more to do.Honestly though, Spider-Man is a little disappointing. It doesn't quite fire on all cylinders. The components for a great film are all there, but somehow it doesn't add up to a satisfying whole.The first half is effective as Peter comes to terms with what he's become, but as the special effects take over, the human element gets lost in the crowd. Some of the action scenes are unimpressive, and the latter half is not as compelling as it should be.When I first saw Spider-Man, I loved it because it was gratifying to see things following the path of the cartoons. But after watching it several times, I now realise it is a rather flawed film, marred by a disappointing climax.Personally, I prefer Spider-Man 2. It is a far superior film, because it is much more well rounded, and makes better use of it's characters. It also irons out the flaws the original had. Spider-Man is perfectly watchable, but it's not up there with Superman or Batman.A good film, but not a great one. Although the classic song on the end credits was a nice touch!","

"Spider-Man","frankiesilver-91836","24 June 2022","This is a very campy typical superhero movie but it does everything it sets out to do. A simple first theatrical depiction of the story of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man that explains just as much as it needs to.People complain he's too awkward but I think Tobey Maguire was cast perfectly. In fact, the entire cast was great: MJ, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, Jameson, and especially Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Willem Dafoe does a truly amazing job. He is the star of the movie especially with that iconic laugh.The comedy is pretty decent too. It got a few chuckles out of me.The fight scenes leave a bit to be desired with how far we've come in the 19 years since this movie released, but they're perfectly fine albeit aged.The ending with Peter denying MJ was super sad and genuinely makes you wonder if he'll ever get with her.In conclusion this is a pretty damn good superhero movie.","

Tobey Maguire was great playing the role of Spider-Man. Willem Dafoe was brilliant and scary playing the Green Goblin. I liked his evil laugh. The Green Goblin is my favorite villain in Marvel. Kristen Dunst is beautiful as Mary Jane Watson. The film had dark moments and I liked them. Danny Elfman's composing is beyond incredible. There were some scenes that made me emotionally sad. I still liked the action. When I watched the film it was like watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series from 1994.I saw Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. The last two films were dark with Doctor Octopus and Venom. All 3 of them are my favorite trilogy by Sam Raimi. He and his brother Ted are still geniuses.","

"Spider-Man","ryanward-45039","4 January 2023","These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas; Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look. Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. Run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's (Toby Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn (James Franco); add Harry's father Norman (Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation. But of course we can't forget Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and J. Johan Jameson (J. K. Simmons).The plot is where a New York City teenager, Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider during a field trip and feels incredibly nauseous. He wakes up the next day and notices he feels stronger and better than ever, and had the ability to climb walls, shoot webs and fight full power. After his Uncle Ben gets gunned down, he finds his killer and sees this as a perfect opportunity to become to become a hero of New York. He then forms a costume, and is now known as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a scientist, Norman Osborn, does an experiment where he tests out an enhancing chemical on himself, and it gives him the power to go insane and create havoc. Soon, his company, Oscorp, gets sold out by his board members. Norman than suits up as the Green Goblin, and creates terror in New York. Peter Park/Spider-Man must save the city from the Green Goblin, and protect the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson from being killed.Spider-Man is a pretty good, well made, and straightforward movie. The origin story of Spider-Man becoming who he is was made and had a great pace for 2 hours. The cast did a great job. Tobey Maguire, in my opinion, has always been my favorite Spider-Man. He knows how to act normal and tough, and had chemistry with Kristen Dunst. Tom Holland is great as Spidey and Andrew Garfield, not so much.While this film is very cheesy, it's the classic origin of our favorite wall-crawler. I absolutely adore the storytelling of this film, with Sam Raimi's charm all over this film. From the incredibly relatable character of Peter Parker, and how he transforms into a superhero. As we see both the origins of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin happen at the same time in the beginning of the movie.Every moment of this film is so fun to watch. The action, while dated, is very entertaining. The character interactions, are very entertaining. This was a childhood classic for me, and part of the reason I love it so much, is because it's very entertaining.I also enjoy the visual style of the film. It's so energetic in it's look. Just by looking at the film, you can tell Sam Raimi made it. It is drenched in his unique style of visuals. It uses CGI very well, and while the effects don't hold up, I think it helps the visual flare of this film. The city looks like it's out of a comic book, with the bright colors and vibrant locations.But, the best part of the film, are the characters. Toby McGuire is still my favorite Spider-Man. And James Franco plays my favorite Harry Osborn. And William Dafoe plays the seriously over the top Green Goblin, and I love the performance. The other actors, like James Franco (as Harry Osborn), Rosemary Harris (as Aunt May), Cliff Roberson, and of course, J. K Simmons (as J. Jonah Jameson) did a phenomenal job.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.9/10.","

"Spider-Man","dbdumonteil","22 December 2004","Adaptations of comics for the screen have become one of Hollywood's main specialties. So far, most of super-heroes for their transition to the screen were entitled to a reliable film-maker and not to a director of musical video clips. Thus, Tim Burton shot ""Batman"" in 1989 while Bryan Singer amazed with his movie ""X-Men"" (2000). Here, it is Sam Raimi who decided to adapt the adventures of Spider-Man; a plan he surely undertook with joy. Indeed, this iconoclastic film-maker is an avid fan of the comic strip. So, he seemed to be cut out more than anyone else for the film. A surprise: his work doesn't disappoint and maintains itself high above the expectations and is incredibly exhilarating. The movie has been a (largely deserved) triumphant success and for Sam Raimi it was his long-awaited commercial breakthrough. Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing for him to have moved in the Hollywood mainstream.Why is ""Spider-Man"" so successful? Simply because Raimi hired a winning team at all levels. First, Raimi's making reflects the enthusiasm he felt to shot his movie. Full of energy, liveliness, it doesn't leave a minute's rest to the spectator. We are carried away by the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man with a lot of frenzy and happiness. It is useful to note down that at the end of the projection, you feel so happy that you ask for more! To come back to Raimi's making, there's a perfect marriage between impressive action sequences and the interesting psychological portrait Raimi makes of his main character. On another hand, the indispensable amounts of humor and emotion haven't been forgotten.Congratulations to the scriptwriter David Koepp. Why didn't he get an Oscar for his work? He has written a watertight screenplay which is flawless. It does everything to remain faithful to the original comic strip. More important, Koepp conceived his script, mainly as a kind of apprenticeship. Peter Parker will test the extent of his powers (first against one of his rivals in his high school, then during a wrestling fight) before putting his red and blue suit on and facing violence in New York and eventually the Green Buffoon (Im not sure if it's the right name).A brilliant screenplay wouldn't be anything without a suitable cast. It is of an impeccable quality. Thanks to ""Spider-Man"" Tobey McGuire probably finds the role of his life. At last a role at the extent of his talent. Beside him, Kirsten Dunst has such an appealing charm that it is difficult to resist her. Willem Dafoe is just amazing in his role of wicked. As for JK Simmons, he may have a short role but each of his apparitions is a delight so much that he nearly steals the show to the other actors.But special effects aren't always subtle or sometimes a little too intrusive and David Koepp has forgotten to remove a few clichÃ©s about his main character, notably at the beginning of the film. But fortunately, they are tiny details and if we ignore them, ""Spider-Man"" appears as a blockbuster whose homogeneity is impressive. It satisfies both the fans of the comic strip but also movie lovers. Raimi's masterpiece lasts about two hours. Not a minute is too much in it. You can't refuse such an exciting show like this one. The second part of the adventures of Spider-Man was launched in the summer 2004 with the same crew and was equally successful as the first one. As we say: we don't change a winning team.Well done Mr Raimi!","

"Spider-Man","ShootingShark","13 November 2005","Peter Parker is a high-school kid about to graduate when he is bitten by a genetically-enhanced super-spider. He develops extraordinary powers; great strength, heightened awareness, lightning reflexes and spiderlike abilities to climb and spin webs. At a crossroads in his life, he resolves to become Spiderman, a crime-fighting superhero ...This is a great action blockbuster version of one of the most famous and beloved comic-books of all time - Stan Lee's Spiderman. It had been done before in the seventies as an animated TV show and a pretty good TV-movie, but this is the treatment it really deserves - a big-budget extravaganza with a first-rate cast, terrific sets and special effects and a brilliant visual stylist at the helm. David Koepp's script wisely invests lots of time in the characters - despite the title, this is really a movie about who Peter Parker is, what happens to him, and why he does what he does. Maguire gives an assured but atypical superhero performance, quiet and affable and completely lacking in pretension. Dunst is a great all-American girl, Dafoe is terrific as the schizophrenic villain, alternating between ambitious-but-cowardly scientist Norman Osborn and his depraved alterego, the Green Goblin, and don't miss a funny cameo by Raimi's old pal Campbell as a wrestling emcee. The one duff note is Franco, whose performance is okay but has too much screen-time and whose role seems a bit unnecessary. There are some terrific gags and set-pieces, like the spider-sense sequence in the school and the big parade the Green Goblin attacks, all accompanied by a great Danny Elfman score. This movie was a richly-deserved success both critically and commercially, for one of American's most original and talented directors, but whilst it is very good I'm afraid I have to say that not only is it not Raimi's best movie, it's not even his best comic-book movie (for that, check out Darkman, which is much wilder visually). It's hard to find any fault in such a fabulous fun flick though, which entertains throughout with laughs, scares, romance and thrills.","

"Spider-Man","KeremUlucay","17 July 2019","""With great power, comes great responsibility."" This is a film about how Peter Parker learned that lesson. Because of that and some scenes, this movie is so comic accurate. In the very first Spider-Man comic book, everything was about that lesson too. Also, in opening sequence of movie Peter says it is all about a girl. That's so true too! But about love, there are some stuff which is so cheesy in that film. Actually it has some more creepy stuff but in the great tempo and editing of the film they are not necessary to think about. Sam Raimi and writers did an amazing job on storytelling and introducing characters. Everything characters do have some reasons; we see what they do, why they do and connection between previous and next acts of characters. Cast is fantastic. I love Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, he is still my best hero because of my childhood. Also, there is someone who steals the show every time: J.K. Simmons. He is fabulous! On the other hand, there is something this movie have which newest Spidey movies don't: Iconic scenes. Remarkable things are happening in that story. Some of them lovely, some of them brutal and some of them exciting. Finally, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movie is a good origin story which this character deserves.","

"Spider-Man","Toph-22","22 December 2020","'With great power comes great responsibility'. This quote stands like no other for this movie adaption of Spider-Man.Even before the hype around Marvel and the MCU went off, Sam Raimi managed to make Spider-Man suitable for the masses. It's a comic book adaption and that's exactly what it's supposed to be.The way Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man is legendarily staged. Always brilliant how Peter is called into the wrestling ring as the human spider in his costume he sewed together himself. Or how he tries to figure out how to use his net.First parts face the problem of introducing characters and their motives. Spider-Man manages that really well.Tobey Maguire as Spider-man is cult for me. He fits like a glove and embodies the human spider like no other. He is my favorite Spider-Man.J.K. Simmons is convincing as chief editor as usual. The few scenes with him are just fun.The fight between Peter and Green Goblin is also magnificently staged.Very successful prelude to the Spider-Man trilogy. I'm already looking forward to the next part.","

The acting all around is great, but Willem Dafoe is superb as the Green Goblin! Sam Raimi also deserves his share of the credit for portraying Osborn's decent into madness. Lastly, the score from Danny Elfman somehow manages to outshine every other great thing about this movie!

"Spider-Man","dee.reid","4 May 2002","Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is lonely, insecure, and is in love with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst), a girl he has had a crush on since he was six. One day, while on a field trip to a laboratory where they are studying arachnids, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically altered spider that had accidentally gotten out of its cage. Peter goes home in a daze over what has just happened. The next day, he finds himself mysteriously buffed up and no longer needs to wear glasses. So off he goes to school to endure another day of torment by his peers. Just as he is about to start eating lunch, a weird feeling comes to Peter, just as Mary Jane is about to slip in a puddle. Peter catches Mary Jane and her lunch just in the nick of time. After he continues eating, Peter accidentally shoots a string of web from his wrist. While trying to hide the webbing, he accidentally pulls a lunch tray and it hits one of his tormentors in the back. Peter then hauls a** out of the cafeteria. The guy he hit in the back follows Peter, looking for a fight. Peter is able to miraculously overcome his opponent with the use of his new found ""spider-sense"". On the way home, he begins running and running and finally leaping from building to building and then spinning and spinning. Peter decides to keep his new abilities secret, but when a thief that he could have stopped kills his beloved Uncle Ben, he then decides that he is going to use his abilities to fight crime. It seems that his abilities could not have come at a better time, as he now has to square off against the mysterious and deadly Green Goblin/Norman Osborn(Willem Dafoe).""Spider-Man"" definitely is the movie to see this year. The hype surrounding this movie is unbelievable. When I went to see this movie yesterday, the theater was packed. Everybody cheered when Peter beat up that one guy and when he tracked down the man who killed his uncle. It seems to me that this movie affected everyone in the theater the same way. There is a very wide range of emotions to be experienced when watching this movie. Some of the emotions I'm talking about like happiness, loss, grief, and good triumphing over evil to name a few. Sam Raimi of ""The Evil Dead"" fame is the perfect director for this film. Some of the comic elements that he uses in some of his earlier films are highly present in this film. You should also be on the lookout for Raimi favorite Bruce Campbell in a small cameo as a ring announcer. This movie succeeds because of two key things: smart casting choices and epic storytelling. First off, Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man! I must admit, that I followed some of my friends when they said that Tobey Maguire could not play Peter Parker. I found out yesterday that is not true. He is Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man. He owns that role. Much as Christopher Reeve played the part of Superman and Michael Keaton was Batman before him, Tobey Maguire will take his place in superhero history as Spider-Man. He is a very good actor in this movie. The scene where he visits Aunt May in the hospital or the ending scene in the cemetery where he talks to Mary Jane about their relationship all go to show how good he can act. Although I have not payed that much attention to Kirsten Dunst, I must admit that she was perfectly cast as Mary Jane Watson. She really has that girl-next-door kind of charisma that is required for a role like hers. Willem Dafoe easily plays one of the best comic book villains of all time as Green Goblin. He's basically torn by grief from loosing his company and from pursuing a life of crime as Green Goblin. The scene where he talks to the Green Goblin mask is one of his best scenes.The costumes for Spider-Man and Green Goblin are some of the most fantastic costume designs and make up effects I've seen since ""Dick Tracy"". This movie deserves to get an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up.The action sequences are some of the best I've ever seen for a superhero movie. The web-slinging scenes, whilst being computer animated, are extremely convincing, largely because they look so real. The scene at the party where Spider-Man and Green Goblin meet for the first time is probably the best action scene in the movie.""Spider-Man"" deserves all the praise that it is going to receive, no doubt. I love this movie. I really want to go see it again, but I know that I probably won't be able to. This movie will blow you away, it'll make you want to cheer and it'll make you want to cry. I give ""Spider-Man"" a big 10.","

"Spider-Man","adamsmith-51004","14 April 2021","""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable film. This film tells the origin story of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J. K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. I can watch this film over and over again, and it's still great to watch and it never disappoints to entertain.","

"Spider-Man","GuyCC","30 June 2002","I meant to review this months ago when I had (by great luck) managed to attend the premiere in Los Angeles.  Regardless, with a ""better late than never"" attitude, this has turned out to be one of Summer 2002's bright spots in an incredibly busy movie season.As it stands, ""Spider-Man"" has all the right elements: A real comic book ""feel"" to it, an excellent Danny Elfman score, Tobey Maguire as a totally believable Peter Parker (with just the right amounts of shyness and the ""old Parker luck""), an appropriately sinister Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, and a scene-stealing performance by J. K. Simmons as the cigar-chomping J. Jonah Jameson.  That's a character that should have been used more in the movie, as he was a lot of fun to see in action.  Here's hoping for more screen time in the next one.There wasn't a lot that I didn't like about this movie.  I still didn't like the Green Goblin costume as much as I tried to, the organic web-shooters didn't bother me half as much as I had figured (perhaps as they weren't overplayed as being so), and while Kirsten Dunst didn't do a bad job as Mary Jane, she just never really captured the ""look"" of what I though the character should be.As for the ""goods"" of the film, the battles were perfectly set up as comic-cook style brawls, with plenty of exaggerated movements and situations.  When Spider-Man web-swung through the streets of New York (love the costume), I couldn't help but get a chilled sense of awe that I originally felt after seeing the first trailer last year.  And the character relationships were great.  ""Spider-Man"" the comic has always been as much about the man behind the mask as it is about the hero.  I'm so relieved that Sam Raimi took noticeable attempts to balance the two.Despite its comic-book origins, the last battle is pretty intense, comparably so to the Tim Burton ""Batman"" films.  And the Green Goblin's scare tactics even made myself jump a few times.  So parents with very little ones may want to check out the film first to see if the kids can handle it.  But in that regard, I'm glad Raimi took the film seriously enough to not let it delve into the lame campiness that was ""Batman & Robin"".  And I'm really glad that they didn't take too many liberties with the Spider-Man origin to remove the emotional impact that it carried throughout the film.As a movie, it retained all of the wonder, excitement and fun that has endeared me to Spider-Man since I was a kid.  As a super-hero film, I can compare it to the orignal ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" films in its high-quality treatment.  I will wait impatiently for the feature-packed (I hope) DVD, and will have faith that the next installment of the series will be as rewarding as this one was.  A must see.  A fun movie.","

I love Toby McGuire in this film because he is so expressive. The visual effects were incredible when he fights and he walks in the air. There are such beautiful sound effects. The costumes are fabulous. the screenplay is very interesting : there are sad moments and there are the collet fightings. For me Spiderman is a big classic of Marvel's films because Spiderman is the super hero of our childhood. For me he is the best super hero because I love his suit and his super powers. The only negative point is that it is not really a funny movie. If you like action and superhero movies, you need to watch Spiderman.","

"Spider-Man","The Spectacular Spider-Man","13 January 2003","The whole point of Spider-Man is what would happen if a real person was a superhero? What if a superhero really existed? In real life? What if there was a superhero, not a Kryptonian in fictional Metropolis, but a real kid in New York?
The suit used in the movie just emphasised the fact that the film was a typical superhero movie. It's a given that superheroes in films have cool costumes; Batman, Spawn, the X-Men, etc. So Spidey followed this, as the audience expected. But the whole point is that Peter can't make a cool, high-tech costume because he doesn't have the resources or the means. He's just a kid, doing what he can. 
If Spider-Man actually existed, he would look like the Nicolas Hammond 1970's TV version. A cheap, garish and silly costume (in the comics, Spidey's costume was often criticised) is exactly what Spidey originally wore in the comics and so wore in the TV show, and would wear in real life.
The cheap costume is endearing. It shows this average guy is doing his best to be a superhero, trying his hardest with the little he has. We can all relate to it, as it's about as good as the average person could do, no better. I feel if the director Sam Raimi and co had been brave enough to make a film of the Spidey concept (a superhero in real life, cheap costume and all) and not try and animate comicbook panels, then we'd really be onto something.","

"Spider-Man","bregund","4 May 2003","There are spoilers in this review.First of all, the casting of Tobey Maguire for the lead role is the film's biggest mistake.  With his pointy lip, jumbo ears, big nose, and squeaky voice, he resembles Screech from Saved By The Bell (I take it Dustin Diamond wasn't available).  Much like Michael Keaton in Batman, Maguire doesn't even remotely resemble the title character.  Since we're talking about miscast superheroes, thank god they didn't make that Superman movie starring Nicholas Cage.  Maguire isn't the only miscast actor in this dud.  Aunt May is annoying, Kirsten Dunst is a terrible actress and Willem Dafoe as the squeaky-voiced Green GoblinÂ…well, let's just say that boy aint right.  They emasculated the J. Jonah Jameson character; in the comic book he's a huge, scary, angry editor who resembles a wrestling character, but in the film he's a meek, squeaky-voiced, accountant-looking guy with all the screen presence of Droopy the dog.  What is it with the squeaky voices?  About the only actor who resembles one of the characters is Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, who doesn't die of a heart attack as he did in the comic book.  Couldn't they keep anything authentic?You know all those really cool special effects showing Spiderman looping through the city between the buildings?  Well, about ninety-seven percent of the film contains scenes that are not that.  Which is to say that three percent of the film doesn't contain scenes that are boring and stretched out endlessly until you want to gouge out your eyeballs with a rusty spike.  The chemistry between Maguire and Dunst is ice-cold.  There are long stretches of boring, pointless scenes that do nothing for the film, such as the wrestling scene.  Parker wants money to buy a car so he can impress MJ.  What was the point of all this?  Spiderman should be out saving people's lives and stopping crime, not worrying about getting money for a car.  This film is laced with continuity and character problems.  The Green Goblin has absolutely no reservations about destroying a balcony full of people, including his own son, and yet when the people on the bridge throw trash at him how does he react?  By letting them throw trash at him.  Why didn't he just blow them away?  And just because Osborne kills the board of directors does not make their decision non-binding.  If Osborne was thrown out for being inept, it's almost assured that the new board of directors would do the same thing.  And the ending is a real problem:  Harry blames Spiderman for his father's death, but how would Harry know that?  Spiderman would have to tell Harry that he killed his father, in which case he would have to tell him thata)  it was an accidentb)  his father was really the Green GoblinThis dry, pointless, barren film has singlehandedly sucked all the fun and joy out of Spiderman forever.","

"Spider-Man","eti55","13 January 2013","Spiderman took me back to when I was 11, when I read the Spidey comics. More than any other comic-based movie, this is the comic book come to life, and it's better than any super hero movie I've seen before or since.I know, I know, a lot of Dark Knight enthusiasts will poo-poo this assessment. Fine (I'd rank The Dark Knight at #2). The thing is, I like movies that balance the serious stuff with a sense of humor (the Spidey comics did this), which is where the Dark Knight franchise falls short. For example, the man-on-the-street stuff leading up to Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson's initial rant had me absolutely rolling. The ill-tempered and insufferable Jameson was done to a T by J K Simmons (""We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong, we can certainly get a picture of THIS weirdo!""). He actually did the comic book character one better; his performance definitely was the straw that stirred the drink mid-film. This is a good thing, as Spidey isn't quite the wise-ass in the movie that he is in the comic (my only complaint, and it's minor).That said, Tobey McGuire does a fine job of balancing Peter Parker, the nerdy science whiz kid, with his genetically-mutated Spiderman alter-ego, creating a bona-fide hero that the audience can root for. It seems every super hero has something that drives them to be a crusader for justice, and in Parker's case it was the guilt over failing to use his new spider powers to stop a thief who would go on to murder his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson in one of his many reliably good performances), who was also his only real father figure. As Parker's love interest Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst is sweet and likable, with just the right amount of sex appeal tossed in. James Franco is good as Parker's spoiled best buddy Harry Osbourne. This leads us to..wait for it..Willem Dafoe, whose portrayal of Harry's father Norman, the arrogant scientist and CEO of Oscorp who puts his own personal ambition ahead of safety for himself and his test subjects, leading to his transformation (via ingesting/inhaling an experimental ""performance enhancing"" drug) into the thoroughly evil, wildly insane and megalomaniacal Green Goblin, is frighteningly convincing, so much so that you can easily look past the cheesy exo- skeleton outfit he wears. Again, I felt like I was seeing the comic book come to life.As for the effects/action sequences, I know, they've been panned by some (notably Roger Ebert), but they looked good to me. I actually liked the fact that they weren't overdone. Ebert in particular criticized the CGI in this movie, but to me, ALL CGI looks phony and cartoonish. I thought the effects looked just fine as CGI goes, and the action sequences were first rate. One scene in particular where Spiderman is hanging by his web while holding onto a train car full of kids, and at the same time trying to save Mary Jane, is exceptionally gripping. It all leads up to a nice payoff at the end, with the final confrontation between Spidey and the Goblin.The fact that this movie came out within a week of the disappointing Attack of the Clones served as a reminder to this former fan of the Star Wars franchise exactly why I like these kinds of movies. It's not about the special effects; it's the people and the story (pity George Lucas forgot about that. Unfortunately so had Sam Raimi by the time he made Spidey 3). What makes Spiderman such a great movie comes down to a good story (lifted from the comic but adjusted to fit the times), along with fun, likable characters you can root for, compelling villains to root against, and good peripheral characters to stir things up (aside from Simmons, Bruce Campbell makes the most of his screen time as a wrestling ring announcer (Ann: what's your name kid? Parker: The Human Spider. Ann: The Human Spider, that's it? That's the best you've got? Parker: Yeah. Ann: Aaaahh, that sucks!) See this again, and don't bother with the reboot.","

"Spider-Man","cherold","15 December 2012","I just watched 2012's Amazing Spider-Man, and it reminded me of how hugely disappointed I was by this 2002 movie. And I just feel like ranting about it, because ten years later, it still really bugs me.It's funny what I remember from this movie. For example, I remember Peter practicing with his web by shooting it at a soda can. I remember that because I remember how the can was placed to perfectly display the brand name in a way that shouted out THIS IS PRODUCT PLACEMENT! If they had set the can down so the brand name was slightly off center I probably wouldn't remember that now.But that wasn't the problem with the movie. That was fine. I recall it being a cute scene. The problem with the movie was the script seemed to have been written by a bunch of people who weren't reading each other's contributions. The best example of this involved Peter and Mary Jane. Early in the film, Peter is either practicing saying something to MJ or writing something to her - I don't recall which - along the lines of, ""you don't really know me even though we live next door blah blah blah."" At the end of the movie, MJ makes this speech to Peter about how she realizes he was always there for her. It really aggravated me, because those two tiny segments are opposites that don't belong in the same movie. How can you make a huge, big-budget film and not catch that contradiction?The real problem with this movie, though, is the bad guy. I don't really remember the story, I just remember there really wasn't much of one. The bad guy was lame and it all went nowhere.Overall, this was a terrible series, with only Spider-Man 2 worth watching (and that one was not as good as The Amazing Spider-Man). But what bugs me most of all is how so few people seemed to have noticed what a terrible script this movie had. What's up with that?","

"Spider-Man","s10ace37","1 May 2002","While I do like the film versions of X-Men, and the first of both the Batman and Superman films, I have to say that Spider-Man stands out above all the other comic based movies.  I caught a sneak preview of what I believe will be the biggest film of the year, and it delivered. Tons of fast paced explosive action, and the story is timeless, and teaches many an important lesson as well.  Tobey McGuire was a perfect choice for Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and now I can't picture anyone else in the role.  And while not as memorable as Jack Nicholson's Joker, Willem Defoe is a great Green Goblin (just wait till you hear him laugh...it'll freak you out). Sam Raimi has just made his best picture, which is hard to believe seeing as Evil Dead 2 is genius.  This is a great film that many will see over and over again, and it is DEFINETLY going to give Episode 2 a run for its money. 9 out of 10.","

"Spider-Man","Netscape_Navigator","3 January 2009","What an odd way to describe a Spider-Man movie of all things huh? Well, let me explain.After I saw Spider-Man 3 in 2007, the disgusting display of incompetent film making and lazy attempts to make money and simply get by on the name alone, left me with nothing but a raging hatred in my core for everyone involved in that abomination of a movie. Watching part 1 again reminded me of how magnificent this franchise used to be. I can't believe these characters that I fell in love with- Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Harry, J. Jonah Jameson, are people that I actually wanted to commit felony acts of violence against in part 3 (particularly Mary Jane and Harry). It was so bad and personal, that I even said that if they continue making more Spider-Man movies in the future, that I would like nothing more than Kirsten Dunst NOT to return (a complete contrast to my views of her in parts 1 and 2, where I loved her). Seeing part 3 even made me second guess myself as to whether the first two actually deserved perfect 10s as I originally scored them. Well, seeing them again reminded me that they ABSOLUTELY deserve 10s, and that's why I'm writing this review. I'll stick to talking about part 1 here.**Great job adapting the comic to the big screen. They captured the campy humor of the comics perfectly, with lovable corny one-liners done just well enough to be corny, but not excessively that it becomes a joke.**At it's core, this movie is basically a love story about a nerd awkwardly trying to win over the girl he loves, with things getting a tad bit complicated having to deal with the fact that he's got superhuman powers. This is a romance story story running parallel to a superhero movie, and it's interwoven with expert craftsmanship, it completely engrosses you.**I've gotta give it to Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, they did some great acting here. All of their scenes feel so genuine. Who can't relate to those little moments that they had together? Like every time they happen to meet up by chance, they would say ""Oh hey!!!"" with a genuine look of surprise as their faces light up with happiness, followed by awkward, nervous conversation masked by their smiles, with Peter consciously making sure to minimize dead air in the conversation. Again, the most authentic thing in all of this is the ""oh hey!!!"" part. Not sure about everyone else, but in my experience, this is THE default greeting between a male and a female that are moderately close, upon unexpectedly meeting each other (less close could result in a simple, less upbeat, ""hey what's up,"" and more close could be running up and giving them a hug).**There's a certain *simplistic nature to this movie that you become fond of. There's a very dense, linear approach that pretty much forces you to love the characters, and want to see the nerd win the girl, and save the day.**If I had to do one thing differently, I would change the Green Goblin's costume. It was too over the top and cartoonish, they should've modernized the look, make it look like something that would be issued by the military for combat. They wouldn't wear a mask that looked like that..Parts 1 and 2 compared to part 3 are like day and knight. Regardless of The Dark cloud which is part 3 hanging over this franchise, these first two installments are the best superhero movies made in terms of pure enjoyment.","

"Spider-Man","hereuser","29 July 2022","Let's start there!For It's time this movie has great effects and green screen working! You can't expect something perfect like nowadays.The scenario is so involving and twisting, but not confusing. It makes you watch it with pure happiness and calmness. We have the typical ""superhero priorities"", but he is also the first superhero who had personal problems(I mean in the comics and now we see it on screen). We have the main characters that have always been involved with the crimes and fights (Harry Osborn, Uncle Ben,etc.). Nobody is missing!We have the one and only Peter Parker with organic web shooters, which actually makes more sense into the name of ""super powers"", and not just high tech web shooter and your only privilege of powers to be climbing. It is so much more heroic and going on with the whole radioactivity spider story than just doing everything with high tech. It gives him character, actual story and actual powers.The acting is one of the best things here. You can forget Tobey Maguaire and call him Spider-man from now on, 'cause he gave out the best perspective of what your friendly neighbor should be!","

This movie didn't let me down.Tobey Maguire fit the part very well. He just had the look. I am in love with Kirsten Dunst, so there was no doubt in my mind that she was going to do great. Willem Defoe even made Speed 2 exciting, so again, there were no doubts.Danny Elfman may have ripped himself off for the soundtrack, but it still wasn't bad.Spider-man is one of our most recent classics. 10/10.

"Spider-Man","ccthemovieman-1","2 August 2006","I enjoyed watching this on DVD a lot more than seeing it at the theater. I also enjoyed the sequel a lot more than this movie, although this has its moments if you can get past the stupid teen romance. The latter is especially unneeded and overdone at the end of the movie.Willem Dafoe is an interesting villain and a decent choice for the role since his resume is dotted with strange characters over the years. One wonders if he - like Johnny Depp - ever plays a ""normal"" person.This film is very good in the sound effects department if you have a surround system. That was one reason I enjoyed it more at home. Big screens make you lose sharpness in a film, too. Tobey Maguire plays a likable ""Peter Potter"" (Spiderman) while Kristen Dunst is annoying as girlfriend ""Mary Jane Watson."" It was kind of interesting to see '60s movie-TV star Cliff Robertson again, as Peter's ""Uncle Ben."" This is not up to Superman or Batman standards, but it will do for a diversionary two hours of super-hero fun. It still entertains, which is the whole idea of it in the first place.","

"Spider-Man","huntermartin-75875","5 December 2018","The time before the era of superheroes. Big Blockbusters were still trying to find a successful formula. Even Star Wars wasn't as successful as it used to be. Sure, movies like Blade and The Punisher came out but those were more aimed at Adults and still gained a bit at the box office but they weren't massive hits. Then in they May of 2002, Average moviegoers would finally see the worlds most amazing, spectacular superhero hit the big screen, spawning a new era of movie's to bust the box office. Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as the titular character, Spider-man follows the origin and first real challenge of Peter Parker and his web-slinging alter-ego as he deals with using his powers in normal life, and fighting his first super-villain: the cruel and dastardly villain of ""The Green Goblin!""
Spider-Man is one of my favorite superhero movies, mainly because it shows the right way to do an origin story. The first time we meet Peter is when he's about to get his powers, putting the viewer into the inciting action right away. After this beginning scene we see Peter's home life and eventually we understand his motivation and his decision to be a good hero when part of that home life is taken away. Despite his age at the time Tobey gives an accurate performance of Peter Parker, and a stellar one as The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
The best part of this movie though is that it accepts its campiness and silliness as a comic book movie and uses that too it's advantage. This is most definitely best portrayed by Willem Dafoe's performance as Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin, staying a serious, worried, sympathetic businessman and Norman and entirely transforming into a cruel campy disastrous villain as the Goblin. While the characters seem entirely different, Dafoe does a great job linking them together and even makes the Goblin seem like part of who Norman really is.
The two of these characters hit their peak at the end of this movie, where we see Norman grieve and regret everything as the Goblin but he realizes it was his fault for it happening in the first place, and Peter learns that you can't save everyone, no matter how hard you try from (of all people) his nemesis.
I still believe that while Spider-Man may not be the objective best Superhero movie out there, it is the best at showing what a comic should be in a live action scenario and has a solid lesson to learn. While sure it may not be as Great as Spider-Man 2 or as ridiculous as Spider-man 3, it finds a good balance in it's characters, truly personifies the Amazing, Ultimate, Spectacular Spider-Man, and its influence can still be seen in Superhero movies- and really lots of movies- today, 15 years later.","

A lot of people say that it was a little cheesy because it was made in the 00s a pretty long while ago, but even then, movies weren't like this, I think it was done on purpose and I think it works great, it makes it feel a lot like a comic book movie.The music fits, the characters are great, Toby Maguire does a nice job at being a nerdy Peter. The movie has some flaws but overall is just a pretty simple superhero action movie that has an ok villain as well, played by the great William Dafoe.The movie isn't the biggest movie but it's just one of those movies that isn't to big, but is just a fun superhero movie.","

"Spider-Man","charchuk","21 August 2006","While spectacular when first seen, this movie does not age well at all. Even now, only four years after its opening, the special effects look dated and cartoony, and the story seems shallow and underdeveloped. It could be because of the release of much superior comic book films in that time span, or simply because the film dazzles at first and then begins to fade. Still, this is a very entertaining movie, albeit a bit cheezy and campy, which works at times, but not for the whole movie.Though the origin story is done very well - one of the best of its kind - the main plot of the movie is weak and pales in comparison. Part of this is the poorly done villain - not nearly developed enough, with a horrible costume to boot. Had the Jekyll-and-Hyde aspect been done better, the Goblin would have been much scarier, but now it just seems laughable. Speaking of laughable, the romance in this film is terrible - some of the lines are cringe-worthy, and it doesn't help that the actors are mostly wooden. Maguire is decent, but better and more believable as the nerdy Peter Parker than the amazing Spider-Man. Dunst is terrible, and unfortunately began the tradition of younger female leads in superhero movies. Dafoe is way over-the-top, but still enjoyable, and Franco is moody and unremarkable. Only J.K Simmons as the newspaper boss Jameson stands out, as he is both funny and true to his character.That's not to say this is a terrible movie. As mentioned previously, the origin story is very strong, from the original spider bite all the way until his superhero status. Though some of the drama is poorly developed, the comedic aspect of it is perfect, and suits the story perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, and the poor CGI is only really noticeable during the close-ups. And the film is never boring, and tells its (somewhat weak) story well. So, overall, an entertaining superhero flick, but nowhere near the best comic book flick ever.","

And of course Spiderman is very true to the comics providing his cheeky gags and punchlines which are intrinsic to the Spiderman character.A must watch and second best Spiderman movie out there second only to it's sequel.","

"Spider-Man","elshikh4","28 August 2008","There is something genuinely SILLY about this movie. So let's review it to discover how it's not ""something"" inasmuch as ""some things"":_(Tobey Maguire) is not Spiderman, Superhero, or good actor, or charismatic star!_How he became Mr. web in my hand? OHH.. He had been bitten by a super spider. So let's have that naughty advanced spider to bite a lot of young boys and girls to have lots of Spidermen, Spidergirls, Spiderdogs. Surely one of them could be less provocative then you know who!_(Willem Dafoe) is kidding with us? Right? Because he is a fine actor, not just a bad joke wearing some kid's stupid green toy. He was having a rare schizophrenia to be a businessman at day, then some MacDonald's plastic doll at night!_Spiderman looks cool and athletic when he is in the suit, but (Tobey) looks just boyish. Another reason to believe that HE'S NOT THE MAN IN THE SUIT!_That script can be the cheesiest script ever. Actually, making a comic book movie does not mean writing it dully. It could've been more suitable to make it like it takes place in the 1940s. To tell you the bitter truth, it looked more like it had been produced in the 1940s!_The CGI was obvious, adolescent, and guess what? Silly._At the scene of (Spiderman) and (Green Hornet), in which they were talking over some building, why I felt like I'm watching a lousy puppet show? Even the kid in me vetoed: ""What kind of nonsense you're watching pal, get a life!""._Why all the characters, the situations, the events, the dialogues, the actors, even the action looked like old bad TV episode with primitive performance from everybody, and campy sense all over everything? A mystery indeed._Spiderman has an idiot alter ego, works at a newspaper, with nervous yet nice editor-in-chief who wants to know everything about the hero from that young journalist! Hallooo!! I hear echoes from Superman here, so why to make it again? As the old comics or not, they didn't find other solutions. Therefore, I got the deja-vu syndromes._ I didn't like (Kirsten Dunst) acting here; it was overdone._(Kirsten Dunst) and her last scene. I can't hold my laughs. At the first time I watched it, I laughed like a drain. Her performance was so awful, and (Tobey) was like a child at a school's play who forgot his lines to gaze smiling with idiot look on his face (I think it's natural), then he refused simply the ""sudden weepy"" love of her and left. I thought: ""You're such a fool! How dare you refuse her love?!, it was a miracle to find someone to love you in the first place!!"". That was illogical, and was acted badly, to a real funny degree!_The last shot, when Spidey is jumping all over the fake skyscrapers, and making a lot of fatuous CGI around, he is just unexpectedly jumping at us??!! Aside from being scary for some, I felt it was extremely funny and so impressive as a good example for this movie's unique silliness._2 sequels?? That's unbearable. Tells you a lot about a generation who wants more psychedelic SuperAnything even it was SuperMaguire!The year of 2008 witnessed the release of part 3, and after a while, there was the release of the parody (Superhero Movie). Although I didn't watch the spoof yet, but nothing could be sillier than the original itself!","

"Spider-Man","NuclearNinja","16 March 2023","I recently rewatched this film as an adult. As a child it felt like an obvious transition from the 90s cartoons to the big screen and I loved every second of it, the action and storytelling all true to what I knew and loved about Spiderman.As an adult I have been able to fully appreciate just how weird and whacky this film is. Sam Raimi really managed to capture a comic book feel in all aspects of the film. The dialogue and delivery is melodramatic without feeling silly. The action was punchy and over the top without feeling unrealistic. The costume and set design feels fantastical without looking odd. I don't think we have seen this level of subtle surrealism in a Marvel film since. Not even the sequels in this trilogy get it right.Even though the casting and acting is great all-round, Willem Dafoe steals the show, with a perfect performance for both Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin. Special mention J. K. Simmons for his famous J. J. Jameson.I'm sure I will come back to this film time and again.","

They talk, she leaves and is then chased down an alley by four randoms. Parker saves her and she doesn't even recognize his voice after having just spoke with him.

"Spider-Man","preppy-3","13 May 2002","You probably know the story, so I'll skip a synopsis.The movie was fun--it moved quickly and had great special effects. I was almost always interested...but there are two big problems with this film:1) Tobey Maguire--a horrible choice for Spider-Man. He's a good actor but he's so quiet and laid-back. Peter Parker/Spider-Man should be played by somebody with a lot of energy and more of a screen presence. I didn't believe him for one second.2) The final battle between Spidey and the Green Goblin--WAY too violent for a PG-13 movie. I was disturbed by it--there was no need to get so graphic.However, I liked everything else. Kristen Dunst was pretty good as Mary Jane Watson and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin) and drop-dead handsome James Franco (as Harry Osborn) are excellent in their roles. There's a LOUD pounding score too and some excellent special effects (which work better on a big screen than on TV). Basically a good summer movie--if only they had cut down the violence and replaced Maguire.","

"Spider-Man","general-melchett","8 November 2006","Spiderman is a really good comic book adaptation - it is well-written, powerful and intelligent. Instead of just being action and no substance, this film is made great by the fact that it focuses on adolescent problems - girlfriends, exams, that banter, and also builds on the character of Peter Parker - there are times when you really feel sorry from him. The opening scene on the bus is a good one - it captures the humiliation and shyness of being the last one on the bus, and also makes you think about Peter Parker, ""God, he's not a popular kid, I feel sorry for him."" Uncle Ben's death was hugely powerful and effective - nearly as moving as things in Schindler's List and other tear-jerkers. I have to admit, that bit did upset me a bit. (But I shed no tears.) So you feel glad when Spiderman murders his killer. The bit when Peter Parker and Aunt May arrived home from Peter's graduation celebration made me feel slightly strange - it felt pretty empty and solemn without Uncle Ben. This only makes Spiderman better - it also has a soul, rather than being just plain action with no emotional side (like the sort of rubbish we get in cinemas nowadays). And that is what makes Spiderman a spiffing film.There is no denying that Spiderman delivers on the action front - it does have a slight terrorist theme, which is pretty daring so close after the 9/11 atrocities. But Spiderman is mostly a tale of revenge, and this is brought to the screen in huge epic battle sequences that you enjoy watching - after all, it is what this film was made for. Comic book adaptations should all aspire to this. My only criticism of this movie was that there should have been a bit more action in it, but apart from that, it was absolutely flawless - there were many stories going on during the film, and we cared about all of them. Well, I did for sure.This film should be in the Top 250 - it should have beat out that awful trash V For Vendetta easily. Many films these days are trying to mix adolescence into their stories - this is one in which it is done successfully. Whenever there was a death in this film, I felt really moved - they couldn't have been done better. On the whole, Spiderman is an absolutely spiffing comic-book adaptation - one that tackles many areas, and one that sticks in the mind for ages after. A stunning job - I solemnly believe that this was better than the sequel. A film that must be watched multiple times before it really hammers itself home. 10/10","

It had some good action scenes, and good performances by both Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire, but I think it could've been better for a couple reasons.One reason is the special effects. I mean Spiderman looks like a bouncing ball as he jumps around and soars through the sky on his web. It just looked corny to me, and you could tell it was all CGI, except for one scene at night where he protects Mary Jane.The other part was the Green Goblin character. William Dafoe is a good actor, and he has a couple scenes here that were all right, but there were also some scenes where he appeared just as corny as the special effects.Also what about Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson. They appeared in the movie but had very little to do. That of course was improved in the second film, which is much better than this one.I'm not trashing the movie. I liked it enough to give it a 7 out of 10, but so much more could've been done to make it better. With the second one it was.","

"Spider-Man","Michael_Elliott","4 May 2012","Spider-Man (2002) *** (out of 4) The first film in the trilogy features Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker, a dorky whiz who gains superhuman powers after being bitten by a generically engineered spider. With his new power he tries to work up the courage to talk to the girl he loves (Kirsten Dunst) but then a family tragedy forces him into crime fighting and battling the Green Goblin (William Dafoe) who just happens to be the father of his best friend (James Franco). SPIDER-MAN is a very good comic adaptation that benefits from some great direction by Sam Raimi, a wonderful screenplay with real characters and actors that bring those characters to life. There's no question that there are some flaws in the movie but none of them are so drastic that they take away from the quality of the film. In fact, I'd argue that the film has actually gotten better with time because of how well-written all the characters and situations are. This here is especially true of the Peter Parker character because he's just not a dork turned superhero. The screenplay really gives him a lot of emotions to play with and I think you really start to feel for the character and then feel for the problems that come along with his powers. The romance with Mary Jane works extremely well as does his friendship with the Franco character and the problems that eventually happen in not only the love triangle but the issues dealing with the villain. Raimi does a very good job at juggling all of this stuff and he manages to make sure that the action scenes live up to the expectation of fans but at the same time they never outdo the story and characters. It certainly doesn't hurt that the casting was so perfect. Maguire has no problems playing both the dork as well as the action hero and that laid back style of his perfectly comes to life in the film. Dunst makes for a good love interest as she just has a certain charm that she brings out of the character. Dafoe is wonderful, as usual, and he never has a hard time playing emotions or anger. Franco also does a very nice job as does the rest of the supporting players. SPIDER-MAN contains some very good action scenes and mixed in with all the human drama going on you're left with a strong entertainment.","

"Spider-Man","Grimbleton","5 January 2022","I love Spiderman along with millions of others, and I was just as thrilled when I first heard there was going to be a movie about my favourite web-crawler. Years later, after having watched it multiple times, I can honestly say this is a fantastic movie worth watching.Spider-Man is such a well-put-together film, despite the many forks and loops in the comic universe from where the source material comes from. Sam Raimi expertly covers an ample amount of Peter's life, his origin and paints an emotional picture of an average kid who's life begins to change. The computer graphics still hold up very well and the thrill of Peter putting on the suit and swinging from building to building is always as exciting as the first time watching. Additionally, Raimi made a smart choice to use the Green Goblin as the antagonist - using Osborn to weave Peter's personal and superhero lives together was Raimi's trick in proving that a comic book movie can be just as heartbreaking as a drama. And of course, I can't forget Danny Elfman's fantastic score, the theme something we all still hum every now and then to ourselves.I loved Raimi's take on Spiderman and loved Tobey Maguire's portrayal of the web-slinger, and now that we've gotten to see three versions of Peter's origin and life, I can genuinely say Raimi hit the nail on the head perfectly. Is this the best Spiderman movie? Not quite - but it's a part of the best trilogy for certain.","

Maguire isn't satisfactory in my opinion, as either part of the role, though he is not as bad as he could be. Mary Jane is OK. The Osborns are fairly accurate. Dafoe's performance does bring up something important about this film, however; there's a lot of ham and camp in this. Perhaps not enough to turn a meat-eater vegan, or make you call your parents and beg to come pick you up, but it still gets to be *painful* at times. Also, the comedy... is it meant to be funny? It almost invariably isn't. The effects are generally nice-looking, although that whole thing about the actual costume of Spidey looking just like the CGI version... yes, and that's because it always looks fake, so it appears, in spite of that not being the case, as if every time we see the hero, he's animated. Plot is fine, and as an origin story, this certainly gets the job done. Pacing is reasonable. The action is cool enough, and the cinematography and editing are inventive and creative. Overall, this ought to please most of the audience, casual viewer and fan alike. There is a little potentially disturbing content. The DVD has TV spots, trailers, music videos, a comic/feature comparison, four special tracks for the movie, one with webisodes, a pop-up factoid one and two commentary tracks, one with Raimi and producers, and the other with VFX people, and finally the option to record one of your own. I recommend this to those it appeals to. 7/10","

"Spider-Man","anaconda-40658","8 June 2015","Spider-Man (2002): Dir: Sam Raimi / Cast: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Cliff Robertson: Spider-Man is a superhero of enormous ability yet viewed in the wrong perspective. Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker who secretly loves fellow student Mary-Jane. On a class trip he is bitten by an unusual breed of spider. Now he can scale buildings and spin webs. His nemesis is the Green Goblin who arrives, as most villains do, by freak accident. Exciting climax where Spider-Man is forced to choose between two factors with the stakes being extreme either way. It is directed by Sam Raimi as a departure from his Evil Dead films. Only Maguire brings a real emotion giving off bewilderment and a sense of awe as he struggles to perfect this new ability. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane basically plays a damsel and kiss Spider-Man upside down. Willem Dafoe as nemesis Green Goblin falters with little concentration on his personality glitch. This results in a lack of emotion where it should be in the conclusion. And it is no surprise that James Franco as the Goblin's son will grow apart from his best friend Parker with Mary-Jane presented as a wedge. Cliff Robertson provides the pivotal yet somewhat cardboard role of Ben Parker, Peter's uncle. Entertaining visual wonder about abilities and the web of pain that can occur if we misuse our gifts. Score: 8 Â½ / 10","

"Spider-Man","AaronCapenBanner","25 August 2013","Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-man with a sense of wonder and fun that he became the perfect choice for the role, though Willem Dafoe as his mentor turned nemesis Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin is equally good. James Franco as Harry Osbourne and Kirsten Dunst as love interest Mary Jane Watson round out a fine cast.Witty script captures the knowing self-awareness of superheroes and villains, and their place in a society that may accept, then later reject them. Director Sam Raimi clearly loves this character, and brings this material to life in grand fashion, with a memorable climax and final scene that sets up the franchise beautifully.One of the best comic book films ever made was a big hit, and became a trilogy.","

"Spider-Man","zetes","5 May 2002","Frankly, a serious, realistic film version of Spider-Man is an impossibility. How, pray tell, does one make a movie with a character like The Green Goblin or Dr. Octopus without making the audience laugh? That's why Sam Raimi was the absolute perfect director for the Spider-Man movie. He's got the most uncanny ability to entertain the heck out of the audience while they are laughing at how tremendously silly the whole thing is. This comes from the Evil Dead section of his career.Now, from the more recent side of his career, like The Gift and A Simple Plan, Raimi brings the ability to people Spider-Man with good characters. Some of them are straight from the comic book, sure. Rosemary Harris' Aunt May is a perfect version of that character. And Willem Defoe's Osbourne/Green Goblin. He's so cartoonish, well, let me reserve a special place later on to talk about Defoe's performance.Now, Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry Osbourne (Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco respectively) are amazingly well realized. I did the same double take that everyone else did when they heard that Tobey Maguire was cast as Spiderman. Huh? That kid from The Ice Storm? Well, he's been very good in several movies (he was also poorly cast in a few movies, too, especially The Cider House Rules), and Raimi obviously cast him because of his acting skills. He could have went for the kid from Dawson's Creek or something, but he was right to get someone who could actually act. Kirsten Dunst may be the most underrated actress out there right now. She's been in some for-the-money projects, surely, and this is another one that'll pay her big. But in the meantime she lands some great roles, things like The Virgin Suicides and Crazy/Beautiful. Even the weak stuff she improves simply by her presence. Spider-Man isn't one of her best performances, but she's good. I like the early stuff, her problems with her terrible parents. It's actually kind of disappointing that they leave that character baggage almost completely behind Mary Jane after they graduate and move into the city. She is more or less relegated into the role of damsel in distress at that point. James Franco, who plays Harry Osbourne, is exceptional. I believe that his character becomes a super villain in the comic book, and that suggestion is left with us at the end of this film. He projects a lot of personality, more than his character actually has in the script.Now for Willem Defoe. No, he's not bad. Exactly the opposite. This is where the film goes way over-the-top, deliciously so. The Green Goblin is a great villain. He's nearly at the same level as Jack Nicholson's The Joker. Willem Defoe has a ton of great scenes, both as Osbourne and as The Green Goblin. I love the seen where he has a conversation with his evil mirror reflection. Critics are kind of complaining about Defoe's performance, but I think it's perfect for the film.Another great comic-book performance comes from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper publisher with whom Peter Parker sells his Spider-Man photographs. His scenes are the best in the film. Hope he has even more next time!My only real complaints about the film are the generous steals from the first Tim Burton Batman film (the balloon parade attack) and The Matrix (the fire sequence). There are so many inventive sequences that it's unfortunate that they couldn't come up with two more original ones.Spider-Man, despite its small flaws, is the perfect example of summer entertainment. I am seriously considering seeing it again in the theater, something I never do for this kind of film. It's probably the only time that I walked out of the theater wondering why the sequel was taking so long to make!Word to Raimi fans: both Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi. They both have hilarious cameos.","

"Spider-Man","TheEtherWalk","18 November 2002","I liked this movie. It is extremely accurate with respect to the comics and tv shows. But there is something about it that I just can't put my finger on. Perhaps it is Tobey Maguire, who was good as Spiderman but awful as Peter Parker. He needed to show more emotion. Or maybe it is the suits which looked WAY too cgi for some reason. Green Goblin's suit was messed up looking. Or perhaps it was Spiderman's webshooters that just appeared on his arms instead of him having to build them. Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. I just think it is a little bit overrated. It needs some tweaking, so I'll give it 7/10.","

"Spider-Man","mymtproject","10 November 2016","2002's SPIDER-MAN is a marvelous telling of my favorite comic book character. When I first heard that Spidey was getting his own movie back in the early 2000's, I was skeptical that the feat could be pulled off. Thanks to the wonders of CGI, strong character casting and good directing from Sam Rami (a guy familiar with the source material), SPIDER-MAN was everything I dreamed it could be! Tobey MaGuire and William Dafoe feel perfect in their roles of Spider-man and his arch-enemy, Green Goblin. JK Simmons as J.J. Jameson is one of the more entertaining characters from comic book movies this past decade. He captures the cigar-chomping, sarcastic Daily Bugle editor in grand fashion! Other supporting casts are good as well, with James Franco as Harry Osborne, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and Cliff Roberson as Uncle Ben. You feel like you're swinging between buildings and dodging pumpkin bombs lobbed at you from Goblin's glider in the action sequences. The story line is easy to follow, has heart and is just plain fun! This one is in my DVD collection. It's not perfect but certainly close; a definite 9 out of 10 stars!","

"Spider-Man","thesar-2","15 November 2009","I should really give 2009's 'Avatar' a chance. When I watched the recent trailers, the blue fish people look really fake in the trailer and it makes me either not want to see it or go for a good laugh. In 2002, I said the same thing about 'Spider-Man.' Spidey looked so fake in the trailer and the action/swinging was so slowed down, I almost didn't see it. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance opening weekend and waited a long time in line. Man, I was not disappointed. Somewhere in translation, they sped up the action sequences and you truly believed Spider-Man was swinging from building to building, fighting, etc. But, there was more to this movie, much more.Director Raimi and writer Koepp added so much depth to the characters, setting and took Stan Lee's age-old teenage comic book hero to new heights, literally. I've always loved the talent of Maguire (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) but you really felt every blow, physical or mental, he went through. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) and Harris (Aunt May) were absolutely perfect from the comic books I grew up on. Oh, and I always love Bruce Campbell (aside from 'My Name is Bruce') so I am glad Raimi loves to continue to use him. Unfortunately, not everyone was pitch-perfect.Dunst (Mary Jane ""MJ"" Watson) was just ""okay"" though she did seem to act her heart out in each scene. (Strangely, I always envisioned her with rich red and curly hair â€“ of which neither were true, though she did have just barely a red-tint.) And what was with the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Dafoe)? Sure, in the 'strip he's either literally green or in a costume â€“ I can't remember him much, he was always my least favorite of Spidey's villains. I guess they needed to upgrade to make him more believable with a horrid mask (again, I'm guess, that's the best they could come up with) which didn't make much scene, since supposedly they made the suit/mask before Osborn went wacko, and it just happened to look sadistic? At any rate, they did a fantastic job, making you truly believe in Spider-Man/Parker and all of his troubles and triumphs while keeping to the core of the always-broke, always-bantered teen who's trying to do good and always vying for the girl (MJ.) Here we have the origin story of Spider-Man, but, like 'Superman: The Movie,' you won't see the super-hero in red/blue tights until about half-way through. You'll be fully introduced to this nerd, his girl-next-door crush, his living arrangement with Aunt/Uncle and the infamous bite that spawned the teen web-slinger.Meanwhile, in the movie's weakest story, Pete's best friend's Dad experiments on himself with some green smoke that, well, uh, makes him stronger and angry. Not Hulk angry â€“ though he's got the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde thing going on, but just upset at those that are against the green smoke in the first place and eventually, of course, Spider-Man. This is one of the same problems I had with 'Daredevil's completely underdeveloped super-villain ""Bullseye."" You're simply asked to believe these two bad-guys have some kind of super-power and that they want to rid the city of the hero because, well, it said so in the comic books.The only other flaw I could tell (and Raimi never seemed to correct this in the following two sequels) was the length. All three movies (so far) are way too long with scenes that could've obviously been trimmed. Granted, this one is the best paced one, but standing alone, it still could've been cut easily down 20-25 minutes.Nevertheless, the movie, as a whole, is highly recommended. The fantastic score (one of Elfman's best,) graphics, dialogue, comedy, romance & longing and the setup were all great. It was a perfect introduction to the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. It can easily be viewed by all audiences, and they did a great job of making it almost virtually timeless so it can be enjoyed by generations to follow.So, thanks Spidey, you not only saved the city and the girl (oops, spoiler), but you might've persuaded me to buy a ticket to help probably the most expensive movie ever, 'Avatar,' make back at least one ticket's worth.","

And it still is one of my favourites.The CGI forms a major part of the movie but it still has so much human element in it. The dialogues are great and the action is top-notch.The whole story on paper looks too simple with the basic structure of hero-villain-beautiful woman-happy ending type, and predictable too, but it is so well done and beautifully shot that you are interested to watch it till the end.Maybe it is not in the same league as The Dark Knight trilogy but this franchise was the one that drove me towards the fascinating superhero fictionalized world.","

"Spider-Man","OllieSuave-007","29 January 2014","I have not read the Spider-Man comics and don't know the character's story or origin, so this movie was the first introduction for me to the superhero. After watching it, even to somebody completely new to the comic book character, it was a pretty good and entertaining movie. Tobey Maguire stars as the nerdy and shy high schooler Peter Parker, who was bitten by a genetically modified spider, turning him into a more muscular and confident man with spider-like abilities that he must use to fight evil and the villainous Green Goblin, all while experiencing a tragedy in his family. Along the way, he attempts to court his high school crush, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).The acting was descent, albeit a little wooden at times, but I think it helped enhance the steady-going plot story. The special effects were neat and there are plenty of action to keep the story entertaining and exciting. I like the movie's motto, ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!"" I think that message couldn't have resonate with a better character like Peter Parker since has to rise to the occasion after experiencing the rough side of high school, tragedy and competition with his more popular and well-off friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).Overall, an entertaining movie which I think is the best of the three made starring Maguire.Grade B+","

"Spider-Man","CinemaClown","9 September 2015","One of the first movies to pave the groundwork for modern superhero flicks, Spider-Man is an incredibly fun & endlessly entertaining action-adventure that brings its web-slinging hero to life on the silver screen in a truly fascinating manner after spending nearly a quarter of a century in development hell and, with its record-breaking box office performance, acts as a precursor to an era when superheroes would dominate the summer box-office.Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the story of Spider-Man follows Peter Parker; a high-school kid who after being bitten by a radioactive spider at a genetic laboratory begins to develop spider-like abilities and puts his new powers to good use by turning to crimefighting. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn experiments a power-enhancing drug on himself as a desperate attempt to preserve a military contract critical for his company's survival.Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man has all the ingredients of a summer blockbuster plus it benefits a lot from Raimi's dynamic filmmaking style that doesn't dwell on a single moment for far too long, keeps the story fresh, light-hearted & action-packed for the most part, plus never loses its initially-gained momentum. David Koepp's screenplay is no slouch either for it packs in a compelling plot & few interesting characters and the whole story is splendidly humoured.The technical aspects are all brilliantly executed. Camera-work is excellent for the most part for the chosen angles, swift movements, slow-mo shots & warm colour palette are correctly employed. Editing provides a frenetic pace to its narrative, each moment has a role to play, and its 121 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Visual effects team makes use of both CGI & practical stuntwork and it's amazing just how well it has dated when compared to other effects-laden movies released back then.Coming to the performances, Spider-Man packs in a very interesting cast in Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Willem Dafoe, J.K. Simmons & others, and many of them are pretty convincing in their given roles. Maguire does a terrific job under Raimi's supervision, Dafoe plays Norman Osborn with finesse but that Green Goblin suit is extremely off-putting, Simmons is a near-perfect rendition of J. Jonah Jameson from the comics while both Dunst & Franco do a fine job as Mary Jane Watson & Harry Osborn, respectively.Also worthy of admiration is Danny Elfman's outstanding score that captures just the right tone & feel of your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man's universe and brims with tracks that seamlessly integrate into the story. On an overall scale, Spider-Man may not seem as impressive today as it did back when it made its debut on the silver screen but it still remains one of the best offerings of its category and delivers a roller-coasted ride that's enjoyable, entertaining & highly satisfying. Far better than its decade later reboot, Spider-Man is summer popcorn extravaganza right on the money.","

Sure, Some of the graphics with spidey hopping around on the balloons looked fake, but get over it. That doesn't take away from the story. And this movie made me laugh. It isn't even a comedy and I laughed more in this film than a bunch of other films. The scenes when Peter is at school getting into the fight with Flash were hilarious as well as when he tries to shoot the web.(END of SPOILERS)    Can't wait for the sequel.

"Spider-Man","joelgodinho","14 October 2020","Spider-Man is a 2002 film directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst.Spidey has always been my favourite superhero, I loved the TV cartoon from the 90's and to this day I think that The Spectacular Spider Man is Marvel's best animated show (or at least tied with Earth's Mightiest Heroes for that spot) and the fact that it only had 2 seasons was a crime against humanity.I also really liked the first 2 films in the Sam Raimi trilogy, in fact the original one might have been my favourite. This is my first time watching that first film since I was a kid and it's still really fun but I don't like it nearly as much.The cast is in my opinion the best part, Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker, Willem Dafoe is fantastic as Norman Osborn who is also the villain Green Goblin, I know that he's a fantastic actor and has been in countless great films including The Florida Project that I adore but I think he will always be Norman Osborne to me, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Rosemary Harris are also really good and so is Cliff Robertson whose character's death is really impactfull and obviously though his part is very small in this film J.K. Simmons is awesome as J. Jonah Jameson.The story is interesting and full of fun moments however I honestly thought that the action sequences are a bit underwhelming though I did like the one when the Green Goblin forces Pete to choose between Mary Jane and a cable car car full of children.Also the way Peter reacts to his powers is really weird, for example he learns he can shoot webs and climb buildings and suddenly he starts jumping from building to building and even swings on a web, how would he know the web could sustain his body? We the audience know his resistance has increased and he would survive the fall and that the webs can sustain his body because we are familiar with the character but Peter wouldn't know that.7.5/10","

"Spider-Man","slightlymad22","15 January 2015","Sam Riami's ""Spiderman"" is a fun comic book movie, but it is not a great onePlot In A Paragraph: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who lives with his Auntie May and Uncle Ben, he hangs about with his best friend (and seemingly only friend) Harry Osborne (James Franco) and lusts after the girl next door Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst) Peter's life is changed for ever when he's bitten by a radio active spider on a school field trip. Once bitten he developed an amazing powers and transforms himself into the superhero Spiderman. Unfortunately Harry's dad Norman Osborne (Willem Defo) has also developed some superpowers and he has transformed himself into the deadly Green Goblin.I had a few problems with this, the first being the menacing Green Goblin looked like a bad guy from the ""Power Rangers"" TV show and at times you could see his mouth was not moving when dialogue was coming out!! The wisecracking, sarcastic Spidey from the comics is nowhere to be seen. The ending borrowed heavily from the comic book ""The Night Gwen Stacey Died"" but didn't have the courage to actually go through with killing off a main character. Another problem for me was, I didn't find Maguire's Peter Parker/Spiderman or Dunst's Mary Jane that interesting. Willem Defo and James Franco were much more interesting as the deranged Father and neglected son.Now on to the good parts. Defo and Franco were both very good. The action scenes were well done, and for the most part the CGI is not that obvious. Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and in particular JK Simmons are very good in their supporting roles. Maguire does well enough in both roles, and Dunst is attractive enough for us to understand Parkers obsession, and she plays a fine damsel in distress. I enjoyed Bruce Campbell, Octavia Spencer and Elizabeth Banks in their small roles. Overall not as good as it could have been, but still enjoyable enough.","

Still, you cannot deny the influence Raimi's Spider-Man had on millions of people around the globe. It had set the trends and inspired generations (especially those who grew up in the '90s and '00s), and that is something only a selected few could accomplish in their lifetime.And you know what was the reason behind this huge success? Although there were many, in my opinion, it was the simple story narrated in a simplistic fashion that did the wonder. There were no complexities, no grey shades to be found, and I honestly believe that made it more accessible and accentuated its already wider appeal.I am in no way implying that having multidimensional characters is a waste; they could turn out to be vital and almost always happen to be critics' darlings, but considering the fact the narrative demanded a basic approach, making it relatively more straightforward was clearly the right decision.","

"Spider-Man","Reviews_of_the_Dead","13 June 2022","This is a movie that I saw in theaters and I loved it. Growing up I had collected some Spider-Man comics, watched the cartoon that came out in the 1990s and he was just a character that I loved. He was tied with Venom as my favorite. When this movie came out, I was excited. I've seen this movie quite a bit throughout the years. Jaime and I watched this in prep for Spider-Man: No Way Home.We get the origin story here by first meeting Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). He is bullied at school, but he's a smart kid. He lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) and he is in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). One day on a field trip, he gets bit by a radioactive spider that ends up giving him his superpowers. After tragedy and graduation, he moves into the city with Harry.Now I should point out that Harry's father is Norman (Willem Dafoe). He is a scientist at OSCORP and they're trying to create super soldiers. With the threat of losing their funding, Norman experiments on himself and becomes the Green Goblin.What I'll say is that this movie hasn't aged all that well, especially with the CGI we get now. Despite that, I think this is still a fun movie. Maguire does a good Peter Parker and I love the whimsical nature he brings to Spider-Man. There's a good cast around him with Dafoe as a great villain. I love that the Green Goblin bleeds over into Norman as he goes on. Outside of them, we have a young Franco, Dunst, Robertson, Harris, J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and even Joe Manganiello as Flash Thompson. This movie isn't as serious as it could be, but I think Sam Raimi shows how great of a director he is with this movie. The cinematography is probably the best part to be honest.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.","

""Spider-Man"" showed that costumed crime-fighters have a multi-generational influence and a mass appeal if kept under one condition: they are about the people behind the mask. What makes ""Spider-Man"" a film that transformed a genre and a whole decade (so far) is that at its heart it is a story about Peter Parker, a normal, geeky kid who comes across great power (that he learns comes with great responsibility). It is an origin story, not obsessed with the action and what the hero does as much as why he does it. Director Sam Raimi clearly connects with Peter Parker and knows exactly how to portray him. Tobey Maguire is an actor that gets at that. There is nothing hunky or masculine about him, yet he is beloved in the role, because through him the audience connects to Peter Parker more than Spider-Man. That connection being so strong then allows for everything Spider-Man does do to become more interesting, exciting and moving. You are with him and Raimi every step of the way.The very reason ""with great power comes great responsibility"" has become such a heavily quoted line is because when the script hits you with it, you're totally ready. After some great action and an interesting story with a compelling villain in the Green Goblin (Defoe) and strong character relationships, ""Spider-Man"" becomes a hit with its final scene. More important than the movie itself, however, is the way this film altered the course of Hollywood for the next decade, a decade that will be remembered that way forever.","

"Spider-Man","funkyfry","15 February 2003","An extraordinary example of the superhero genre of action films -- it manages to create in the audience a sympathy with Peter Parker (Maguire), the high school student turned ""Spider-Man"", as well as a sense of shared, vicarious joy as spidey discovers his tremendous powers.  The movie is fun and funny, Raimi providing a fast-moving arena for the excellently realized CGI spidey to do his tricks (just watching it made me want to go buy the game for X-box, but I haven't gotten around to it yet).  He must face the Green Goblin, his classic foe, played to a 2-sided malicious tee by Dafoe, whose character doubles as a big-time weapons manufacturer.  Dunst and Franco are merely adequate.  That rare kind of superhero film that left me itching for the sequel -- bring it on, Marvel!","

"Spider-Man","thinker1691","28 April 2006","Having grown up in the 60's, I, like so many millions of young teens were introduced to Spiderman through the medium of Marvel comics. Now through the magic of Hollywood Cinima, American audiences are further introduced to ""Spiderman"" the movie. The imaginative comic writer, Stan Lee is credited with bringing his web-swing character to life and does a 'marvelous' job of transferring the lonely, troubled teen to the big screen. His original concept is that of a young, book-worm, nerdy teenager who is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. Nearly dying, Peter Parker, (admirably played by Tobey Maguire) awakens the following day and discovers that instead of killing him, he has been transformed into a super hero with astonishing powers. Everything from his spider senses to his incredible spider strength, Parker is at first convinced he can make some easy money, by exhibiting his abilities in an arena. Unfortunely, his perception of why he was chosen is changed when his seeming ambivalence turns to tragedy with the death of his favorite uncle. The film is imaginative and laced with action scenes which enhance the comic-book-hero's' exploits. With the additional talents of Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the film proves it is slated to become a classic. ****","

There were A lot of slow scenes in this movie, with some really good action sequences I do like some of story that taken away from this movie that wasn't in the re-boot. I didn't find this movie as dark as new one, Which I still do prefer Maguire as man. I felt like we connected a lot more in this story and cared about him (I can't say the same thing new spider-man) The Actions scenes in this movie was really good and very decent not over the top and don't drag for too long.The acting was really good from the whole cast. 7 out 10 really good movie","

"Spider-Man","Fluke_Skywalker","21 March 2015","Sam Raimi's genre re-invigorating blockbuster holds up reasonably well. Maguire makes for an earnest and likable Peter Parker. He's not quite as comfortable with the wisecracking stuff as Spidey, but Raimi doesn't really focus on that very much here. Dafoe's a little hammy, but his performance fits in well with the tone of the movie. I found my self swooning over the sweetly vulnerable Kirsten Dunst, so mission accomplished there. And J.K. Simmons... Let me just say 'Whiplash' should've been his second Oscar (mild exaggeration, but he owns).The action scenes are a bit lacking in the thrills department, but the F/X work holds up pretty well save for a few noticeably dodgy sequences. And Danny Elfman delivers one of his least annoying scores. But what ultimately makes it work is its heart. Raimi gets the crux of Peter's journey--that with great power comes great responsibility--right (it's one of the many things I felt the reboot botched). As a result, the story and the characters all resonate emotionally","

"Spider-Man","Chris_Docker","10 June 2002","Spider-Man, the movie, knew what it needed to do and got on with it. As a sci-fi comic-strip action adventure adaptation this is one of the best. I am reminded of the tagline ""With great power comes great responsibility"" when I see how vintage director has handled the special effects. They are colourful, emphasise the story rather than their own technical mastery and have a beauty to them that is almost choreographed in its appropriateness. Tobey Maguire, irresistibly cast as the young lad who grows up to discover he is ""Spider-Man"" takes to the skies with all the joy of an adolescent with a new toy. Kirsten Dunst is melt-in-the-mouth as MJ. The transition from comic book to celluloid is effortless and an achievement within the genre, with the assistance of veteran writer David Koepp (Panic Room, Stir of Echoes, Mission Impossible, Jurassic Park to name just a few). Of course, Spider-Man, no matter how well done, is not everyone's cup of tea. Nevertheless, it leaves Batman, Superman and even X-Men standing.","

"Spider-Man","aliceboy","29 October 2006","I should preface anything I'm about to say by saying I don't like superheroes. These men (and women) in tights are holdovers from when comics were aimed strictly at kids, but now are being read by adults. They cast the world in tones of black and white (or, in the case of this movie, red-and-blue and green...) and oversimplify morality in a way only the real-life comic logic of organised religion does better. This said, I have to admit that I liked this movie. I worked in a comic shop for 10 years, and during that time witnessed the beginning of the recent boom in comic-book movies. Customers would get completely worked up over the latest spandex thriller to hit the big screen, but I'm only catching these movies years later on the small screen. Originally, I hadn't planned to give any synopsis on this story, thinking that if you were going to see this and didn't already know the story behind the spider I had no sympathy for you. However, I then found my own wife had no idea how Peter Parker got his superpowers, so here goes... Mild-mannered ubergeek Peter Parker lives with his elderly Aunt May and uncle Ben, next door to his longtime crush Mary-Jane Watson(who doesn't have any interest in him, of course). On a field trip, he's bitten by a scientifically altered spider, and finds himself endowed with special spidery powers...and a buff new physique! Naturally, being a much-downtrodden teenager, his first instinct is to use these powers to impress girls. Or, more specifically, one girl: Mary-Jane. However, through a series of events, his own actions lead to his beloved uncle's death, and he realises what his late uncle said was true: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' He thereafter commits himself to fighting crime with his newfound abilities. Wackiness ensues...I mean, ADVENTURE ENSUES! The story, at its roots, is pretty true to the source material, for better or worse. On the plus side, the movie maintains the childish charm of a comic book; on the minus, the movie doesn't really surpass the childish charm of a comic book. My only real beef with this movie was probably just a technical limitation of the time (only a few short years ago) when digital effects were STILL not up to bringing this particular character to the screen. While Tobey Maguire pulls some great physical acting out of his performance, it becomes all too clear when the switch is made to a computer-generated 'person' clumsily climbing the side of a building or swinging through the city. I can only imagine such effects looking much, much worse twenty feet high on the big screen. Sam Raimi, who brought us the much-beloved 'Evil Dead' trilogy (and countless other truly crappy movies), is a good choice to helm this flick. His work in 'Army of Darkness,' 'Darkman' and others show he has both an understanding of what makes these stories appealing as well as an appreciation for faithful adaptation of the superhero ethos. The downside of this, is that Parker, arch-nemesis Norman Osborn, Aunt May and the others end up consigned to the otherworldly realm of comics. They never at all approach believable real-life characters, and this removes the viewer from the 'reality' of their world (both the viewer's AND the characters' worlds). Compare this to Bryan Singer's work on 'X-Men.' He managed to take the equally ridiculous other Marvel/Stan Lee icons and mold them into acceptable members of the world we live in. Sure, they have superpowers/mutations, but they also have believable personalities and interactions with reality. I suppose the difference lies in what you want from your superhero: for a reasonable adaptation of the superhero into our world, see the 'X-Men' movies; for pure escapist fantasy, see 'Spider-Man.' Either way, you're not liable to be disappointed as both pack thrills and visual excitement into their brightly coloured packages.","

"Spider-Man","Agent10","3 May 2002","-contains spoilers-Wow! What a waste of money, talent and film stock. Many elements have to fall into place for me to completely hate a movie to the point where I feel like setting the movie theater on fire. Where to begin.Before the bashing begins, I will say Tobey Maguire was very believable as Peter Parker. Hhmm, that seems to be the only thing I can say that isn't snide or cutting. First off, Hollywood should now realize this whole ""replace-the-human-with-CGI-effects"" idea just doesn't work. It didn't work in Blade 2, and it certainly did not work in this film. Maybe imagination or blue screen acting would be more appropriate than trying to replace the human form with fake and awkward images of light and bit maps. It was like a bad video game. The dialogue also felt forced in many areas, especially when Parker tried to reveal his true feelings for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). They did it twice, and it still didn't work! David Koepp went from writing Panic Room to this slop! I haven't seen a dive like that since a Don King promoted fight.Typically, I rarely put down music, but then again, I think its time for Danny Elfman to go on some reunion tour with Kajagoogoo or whatever the heck the name of that band was he played for. Its obvious he has lost his touch. In fact, this entire movie wreaks of Batman, which was a far superior movie.The music was a blatant rip-off of Batman, and the movie even tried to rehash certain elements and moments. Let's see here: a chemical turns Willem Dafoe into a maniac, Dafoe's character trying to be nice to the superhero at the end before trying to kill the hero, the scene where the editor calls all of Parker's photos ""crap"" (which was exactly the same way Batman did it), the Green Goblin killing a group of people who want to rub him out of the picture (like the Joker and the other mobsters), etc. The similarities are far too numerous to number, the only difference is that Batman actually had some flair and magistry. This was nothing but a high, gloss picture with pretty images and mind-numbing editing techniques.I should have stayed away considering Sam Raimi had directed this film, but for some odd reason, I decided to follow the crowd. The lesson: be yourself and watch something else.","

It's hard for me to tell you specifically why. When he and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) kissed, I got all warm and tingly inside. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed ride that you'll want to see over and over again to all Tobey Maguire or Kirsten Dunst fans who haven't seen it.

"Spider-Man","SP-10","4 May 2002","I don't know where to begin with the mess I saw on the screen last night. I'll start with the acting. Tobey Maguire is a so-so Spiderman sometimes right-on, others just too goofy. Some really bad one-liners in this film. It looks like he's about to laugh when really he's trying to cry- bad acting in my opinion. Dafoe as the Green Goblin was good but the Goblin looked like a Power Ranger character. Dunst is the typical girl role. Kind of average looking but my does she have some assets. I could not believe what I saw during the rain-fight sequence. My lord, the theatre was filled with 8 year olds!! Still my favorite scene in the movie.The storyline & flow is what really puts this movie in the dumpster. Basically there are none. There's no build-up, the end battle just happens. Overall, a bad script & a bland story with bland acting. The special effects are great sometimes but horribly computer generated the next. Note to Hollywood: Please stop adding Matrix style scenes to every freakin action movie. Also, please stop with the ""we love New York, we love America themes"". We get it OK. We're dealing with post-Sept stuff enough. It's only placed into movies that are so awful they need it for dramatic overtures.",NA

"Spider-Man","Spleen","12 November 2002","At first it looks as though the title sequence lets us know what we're in for: the kind of hyperkinetic visual display you'd expect from a fourteen-year-old boy who'd just been handed a cheap (but nonetheless overpriced) computer animation program and who was determined to use every misbegotten one of its features at once. I thought I was watching the end result of an arms race in which studios vied to combine maximum glossiness with minimum creativity.Not at all, as it turns out. ""Spider-Man"" is the kind of fantasy we haven't seen since the 1980s: sweet, sincere, straightforward, and thrilling Â– or at least, if and when it fails to be thrilling, it at least makes an honest attempt.The movie works even though Raimi gets more wrong than he gets right. The main problem is that there's little real zing. But in addition: the dialogue is often awful, too many characters (the aunt in particular) are under-written, under-described clichÃ©s, and the montage Raimi throws at us as Peter Parker comes up with his spider suit design is just too goofy for words. What's more, when we get within fifteen minutes of the end it becomes clear that everyone stopped paying attention to the movie they were making and started thinking about the money to be made from a sequel. I won't say what happensÂ… Okay, I WILL say what happens, so stop reading if you must. Peter gives up Mary Jane Â– fails to tell her identity even though the entire narrative is structured around, is crying out for the moment in which she finds out - for no better reason than to facilitate a sequel. (Thus the most likable character in the film, on whom so much time had been spent, is given nothing to do, no real role to play in the story.) The misunderstanding over the identity of Norman Osborn's killer has been crudely pasted into the film for much the same reason. Is there any reason why Harry had to happen to see Spider-Man standing over his father's body, and then jump to an obviously wrong conclusion? None whatever, but it DOES provide him with a sudden overpowering ""motivation"" which will, alas, result in all manner of tedious plot complications in the sequel, perhaps even Â– who knows? Â– the sequel's sequel.The final image, by the way, is every bit as bad as the opening ones. It just goes to show that nobody has ever made a movie better by including a shot of the American flag, in any context whatever.But don't forget what I said earlier, about this being a sweet, sincere, simple Â– and for the most part competent Â– fantasy. Kirsten Dunst is charming.",NA

"Spider-Man","Spidey1975","6 August 2022","""With great power comes great responsibility"". These words, spoken by Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) during his last conversation with his nephew and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi faced when asked to bring one of America's most beloved superheroes to the big screen. And yet, despite the challenges faced by the team behind it, the 2002 Spider-Man movie became one of the most cherished and successful superhero movies of all time. It's quite possibly the most influential superhero film of all time, as many of the Marvel movies that came out afterwards used it as a foundation, and even the MCU has taken some inspiration from it.Our Hero Peter Parker gets bitten by a genetically-enhanced radioactive spider while on a school field trip. As a result, overnight, Parker acquires spider-like abilities: superhuman vision, a grip which enables him to climb buildings, the ability to create strong spider-webs (an undeniably useful skill in combat), and godly strength (as well a more muscular physique). Parker initially uses his newfound powers to try to earn money and impress Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but is admonished by his uncle who later dies due to a selfish act on behalf of Peter. It's due to this tragic event that he truly realizes what the words of his wise uncle meant. He's been given unimaginable power, and with that power comes the responsibility to help those who can't help themselves. Not just because it's the right thing to do, but also because of how one misdeed can lead to a million others.Tobey Maguire is simply fantastic in the lead Peter Parker/Spider-Man role. Even as a 26 year old he manages to play the part of an 18 year old nerd perfectly. He brings such a great level of complexity and emotion to the role, and it helps really flesh out Spider-Man from it's 2D cartoon life onto the big screen. And while it was of course impressive seeing how truly *amazing* he is as the nerdy high-schooler with a secret superhero identity, I was quite honestly impressed with Dafoe, who brought a similar level of complexity to his character that Tobey Maguire did with Spider-Man. And the relationship between the two really does serve to drive the film forward.There's no doubt in my mind that Kirsten Dunst has gotten an impressive amount of attention for her role in Spider-Man. Raimi seems to be as fond of her as Peter Parker is, and she manages to take that attention and really light up the screen. Kirsten Dunst has been on camera since before she was 8 and it shows. She seems like a natural playing Mary Jane and shows she's really made it as an actress. The energy she generates during the movie with Tobey Maguire is fantastic and this is beautifully displayed in a brief kiss with an upside-down Spider-Man, undeniably the most iconic scene in the movie.It's hard to imagine anyone else but Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. You simply can't bring back Norman Osborn without bringing back Dafoe. His portrayal of the Green Goblin is the definitive version. He provides some of the film's most dynamic scenes. However, the Goblin is only half as scary as Dafoe without the mask. One of the best things in the film is the casting of J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who has produced the best version of Spider-Man's biggest critic, so much so to the point where most people hear his voice when reading his lines in the comics. Simmons's performance is absolute perfection. It's why so many of us were thrilled by his cameo appearance at the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home. Rosemary Harris is sweet and rock-solid as Peter's indispensable Aunt May. And Cliff Robertson turns in a lovely performance as her husband, whose brief time on screen provides the film's moral centre.Up until this point, most comic book movies went for practical effects over computer effects. With John Dykstra in charge of visual effects, the film would prove to be a game changer. When we're talking about a character who swings from building to building, you are effectively forced to do this on a computer. Technology is more advanced today but the film is still an achievement for its era.And of course Danny Elfman's contributions to the score cannot be understated. This film's music is quite frankly incredible. It's main theme is up there with the other most cherished songs from any movie, show or video game, including One Final Effort from Halo 3, My Heart Will Go On from Titanic, or even any of Dave Porter's contributions to the soundtracks of Vince Gilligan's best works.While this movie is by no means perfect, it managed to kick-off the golden age of superhero films. It really feels like the most genuine attempt at a superhero film and personally I think that's worth something.",NA

"Spider-Man","brando647","1 September 2008","In 2002, the world was treated to the second big budget treatment of a Marvel comic book in the form of Spider-Man. Bryan Singer had opened the doors for major comic book adaptations two years prior with his adaptation of the X-Men, and he proved such movies could make major earnings in the box office. Well, along came a spider and proved just how true that was when Spider-Man grossed $403.7 million in the United States alone. The film introduces audiences to the origins of the hero, when Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically-altered spider and is given extraordinary abilities (i.e. web-slinging, wall-crawling, his ""spider-sense""). After the death of his uncle at the hands of a car-jacker, Peter becomes determined to prevent crime and evil forces from ruining the lives of others and his first real test arrives in the form of the Green Goblin.My favorite aspect of Sam Raimi's film is that it FELT like a true Spider-Man movie. While I did enjoy Singer's X-Men, it didn't have the same feel as the comics/cartoons. It was the X-Men, but it was Bryan Singer's X-Men. Watching Raimi's film, it feels as if it's ripped straight from the pages of the comics. It faithfully depicted all of it's characters with a couple exceptions; some liberties had to be taken to fit 40 years of comic book history into a 2 hour movie. Just as in the comics, Peter is troubled by having to juggle his life as a super-hero with his life as a normal person, and one of the lessons our hero learns over the course of the film is that he can't have both. Raimi also gives us some great character development on the part of the villain, Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin. He takes the time to build up the father/son relationship between Norman and his son, Peter's best friend Harry, which builds up for further stories in the future.In addition to having a fantastic filmmaker at the helm, the movie benefits from near perfect casting. Tobey Maguire is more than capable of pulling off the meek, nerdy Peter Parker as well as his web/one-liner slinging alter ego. Kirsten Dunst, while not overwhelming in her performance, was a great Mary Jane Watson and James Franco was a solid Harry Osborn. As I said, the casting was pretty much perfect across the board, right down to Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Peter's aunt and uncle. The best (and I know of many who agree with me) was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn. Seriously, I can't think of another actor who pull off such eccentric, insane roles like this man. He WAS the Green Goblin and I couldn't see any other actor having stepped into that role.The movie contains plenty of action with seamless CGI inter-mixed into real-time stunts, and the story also contains a strong plot with more than enough heart to make this more than just an action flick. Aside from a few slow moments, there really isn't much to complain about with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and I think he was the first to set the standards for what the comic fans should expect from big screen adaptations of their favorite heroes.",NA

The plot is a bit fuzzy.  The editing work is rather poor.  The acting is pretty good, but the costume for Williams Dafoe is idiotic.  Alot of the CGI work is extremely fake.They didn't do much in way of production values for the dvd.  It's design in both technical and layout was created by a drunk.  With absolutely no hint on how to design a good menu system.  It does have a good share of easter eggs.  The CGI bloopers provide about a minute of laughs.  But the other 2 minutes are filler crap.  Shrek's CGI bloopers are better.The majority of my 6/10 rating comes from the last 20 minutes of the movie.A majority of plot items are left explained.  Who made his nice gettup? You don't go from a moronic costume to this awesome suit without some sort of inspiration.And the idiots at Columbia/tri star failed to respect Stan Lee (the creator of Spider Man).  Last I heard, he was suing.  But that was a couple of months ago.  I do hope that was an oversight.Alas, this is just a little better than another blockbuster flop. Independence Day.6/10

"Spider-Man","dunmore_ego","19 August 2004","From the web-woven opening credits to the last strains of the cartoon theme as the copyrights roll, Spiderman joins the pantheon of underpanted heroes whom the movie forum has portrayed as mightily as their bulging quadriceps (at this movie's release date, that being only Superman and Batman - the OG's).Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, James Franco and Kirsten Dunst's Breasts.Spiderman's new movie franchise ambassador had to win over audiences in his first 5 minutes screen time, or go the way of Leno-chinned Nicholas Hammond, the vacuous, Gilligan-hairdo nerd of the late-70s TV series, The Amazing Spiderman, which was as exciting as swallowing chalk. Tobey Maguire, running after his bus, browbeaten by schoolmates, lamenting in voice-over his teen-age problems, was a winner right outa the gate! An exhilarating feature of this film was the web-swinging (non-existent in the soporific Amazing Spiderman TV series, due to its technical difficulty). Movie technology has lent literal wings to stunts and visuals which were impossible in the days of Adam West running around with a Wile E. Coyote bomb over his head, or Reb Brown decimating the legend of Captain America throughout that whole ineffectual DOINK of a movie. Truly this is the correct era to begin making films of 'super' heroes, for only now can movie-makers convey a 'superiority' that George Reeves could never achieve by lying on a table and being chroma-keyed onto a swishing sky-scape.Aficionados may lament that there *is* a CGI jerkiness to the man-spider's swinging - but this nonhuman factor somehow only enhances the arachnoid element in this 'spider'-man. It's a letdown, yes, knowing that Tobey is not even on screen when Spiderman is barreling along, but it's better than watching 'crooks' with pencil-mustaches shooting at George Reeves with their hats on, while he poses arms-akimbo-legs-apart, then crushes their guns like the movie-clay models they are ('one-trick-pony' in the dictionary, there's a picture of George Reeves as Superman).In the 60's comics, Parker was bitten by a 'radioactive' spider Â– this was updated to 'genetically-mutated' spider, reflecting each era's fears and misunderstandings. The decision to have Spiderman internally generate his webbing seems more rational now, than his creation of web-cartridges in the 60's. It always intrigued me why Stan Lee (Spiderman's creator) balked at the webbing aspect, giving his young hero super-strength, an inexplicable 'spider-sense' and even the power to walk up walls (which should not be possible; stickiness of appendages is irrelevant, but rather volume-to-surface-area ratio allows insects this ability), yet no endemic webbing Â– a spider's trademark. (Spiders 'spin' their web via spinnerets located anally, so did Lee consider this and veto it? Â– and I suppose any superhero generating web from a butt-spinneret would lose most of the popcorn vote.) Who better to play Spiderman's greatest arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin, than Willem Dafoe? Face carved from crazy and body ripped like Jesus in crucifixion pose, Willem OWNED this role. The kiddies might have relished Norman the Goblin in his techno armor suit (a deviation from the comics, though definitely an improvement on the purple and green sexually-indecisive Halloween attire), but my favorite scenes were Willem battling the Goblin Within; when he was simply - like John Malkovich Â– Being Willem Dafoe.James Franco, as Dafoe's barely-tangible son and Peter Parker's almost-incorporeal pal, Harry Osborn, phoned in his role on a cellphone that kept cutting out. In the comic world, Harry wildly grabs the party reins when his father dies at Spiderman's hands, and becomes the second Green Goblin. By movie's end, Franco - in a valiant attempt to become three-dimensional - vows to make Spiderman pay for killing his dad, but I don't think any of us can visualize the fey Franco carrying the torch of Divine Wicked that came so rapturously naturally to Willem. Probably the biggest crime this wisp of smoke could perpetrate would be to join a boy-band and pretend to be The Hard One.Can anyone deny the integral role played by Kirsten Dunst's Breasts?; ubiquitous, delinquitous, nasty-perky, herky-jerky, firm yet forgiving, relentlessly real, cruel but fair. Remember, dears: when walking home from work, *always take the darkest alleyways and wear no bra*. Flame-red locks, sotto voce delivery, camera unable to focus on anything BUT those mounds of necessity, those pillows of slavery. Spiderperve has the advantage that most of us who wear dark glasses indoors gainfully employ: behind that mask, we KNOW what he's looking' at! After impressing her by kicking white-rapper butt, he hangs upside-down passively, allowing her to ease his mask off his mouth, in the same manner she would ease dark-nylon stocking from betwixt milky thigh, rain streaming down his roundish head, delineating her pinkish curves, as they lock lips in a tongue-roving, erotogenic, nerve-jangling, storm-driven kiss, rivaling easily the heat of Scarlett & Rhett in Gone With The Wind, or Rourke & Basinger in Nine Â½ Weeks, and even Christopher Reeve and Michael Caine in Deathtrap. The subliminal metaphor was not lost on this disciple of heady foreplay: Fear, Sweat, Violence, Surrender. And all of it Â– WET. The Human Procreation Arc.Like the movie's slipshod ending, I have to wrap this essay suddenly (I've reached my word-limit, as Raimi probably reached his budget-limit). Kirsten Dunst's Breasts suddenly profess an irrationally-deduced 'love' for Parker, which is an essay unto itself, outlining the needless 'hope' this would instill in geeks who bag their comics who are NOT secretly superheroes: perpetuating the fantasy that a Pasty-Boy can Make Good if his Love is Real Â– well, boys, you'd better pray that somewhere out there, there's a radioactive ferret with your butt-cheeks' name on his teeth.(Read this review unabridged at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/Spiderman.html)",NA
"Spider-Man","Angelus2","27 October 2009","Peter Parker is bit by a spider and in turn he receives the powers of a spider...But after living his life on the side-lines, Peter begins to enjoy the perks that come with super powers; until tragedy strikes and Peter learns that with 'Great Power Comes Great Responsibility.'.The cast all do a tremendous job in bringing the Spiderman world to life. The give the comic book characters depth, emotions and a voice that reaches out beyond the screen. What I loved more was 'Spiderman' the suit was amazing and cinematography was even greater as it brought the comic book world forth. I felt that the fight scene could have been much better, but was satisfied with Sam Raimi's take on this beloved comic book legend.",NA

"Spider-Man","classicalsteve","6 May 2015","The first time an iconic superhero flies across the big screen in his (or her) tights, cape and/or mask, the end product often has mixed results. The bar was set pretty high with the first ""Superman"" film starring Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando, and Gene Hackman, still probably the finest superhero film ever produced. The first ""Batman"" film, directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton in the title role and Jack Nicholson as the Joker had problems, some wonderful moments in between lagging scenes. (Some people have called ""Batman"" the best mediocre film ever produced! Or is it the most mediocre film among good ones?) Either way, the end result may or may not hit the mark. Luckily, especially for fans of the original comic book, the first Spider-man film, based on the character created by Stan Lee, works on a level towards the original Superman film.When you boil down the raw elements needed to create a good film, you need three things: a good premise, good actors, and a good screenplay. And let's not under-appreciate the last one. While a good screenplay still may save mediocre acting, often the opposite isn't true. In Spider-man, all three are present in spades. Let's look at them in terms of how they are portrayed in the current film.The Premise. Well, the premise must be a good one because, since its inception in the 1960's, Spider-man has become one of the most important comic heroes alongside Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. However, Lee brought a bit of a twist to the character. Like other superhero characters who have some magic-like abilities, in this case the abilities of a spider inside a human body, Spider-man's alter-ego, Peter Parker is a troubled adolescent suffering from the typical angst of all young people around that age. Unlike Superman, Parker is still finding out where he fits in. In terms of the present film, the original premise, although updated slightly for the 21st century, is still adhered to. Parker/Spider-man is an angst-ridden kid, loving a faraway female, trying to navigate school, and dealing with bullies.The Acting. The acting takes us right into the heads of the three most important characters: Spider-man/Peter Parker (Toby Maguire), the Green Goblin/Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), and Mary Jane Watson, a.k.a. MJ, (Kirsten Dunst). Maguire offers both the angst-riddled teen and the resolved superhero. I particularly appreciated the way he was portrayed in the film. Not a bad-looking kid but not a GQ cover model either. He's rather nerdy, a science wiz, like Lee had envisioned him, but not the best at getting dates. The absolute stand-out is Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin/Mr Osborne. Character actors like Dafoe, similar to Gene Hackman as Lex Luther, are the best suited to play villains. Dafoe is terrific as a kind of Marvel equivalent of Two-Face, having two sides to him. On one had he's the upper-crust businessman who's tough but confident. However, the other side, the Green Goblin side, emerges and confronts the ""waking"" self. He becomes a kind of split personality that few actors can pull off, and the scenes in which the two sides speak to one another are entirely believable. Also honorable mention to Dunst who is a very attractive high school girl but certainly not someone who will be entering teen beauty pageants. She attracts the likes of Peter Parker at a very human level.The screenplay, probably the most important ingredient, works well, and much better than the Keaton/Burton ""Batman"". Parker is a typical high school kid just trying to navigate through school, being cared for by his adoptive uncle and aunt since the death of his parents. Then a strange circumstance changes his life: he's bitten by a radioactive spider which gives him spider-like abilities. A nice series of sequences shows him testing his new-found talents. At first Parker uses them to earn money in trashy athletic events, but then he switches gears and decides to use them to combat evil. Certainly we know this will be Spider-man's calling but a conversation with his uncle puts him on track, reminiscent of Brando as Superman's father. On another front, the father of a friend of Parker's, Norman Osborne, is head of a tech company testing a machine which would improve human metabolism in soldiers, probably for the military, a bit like Captain America. Osborne built the company, but now the board of directors are selling the company out from under him. He retaliates by testing the metabolic-altering machine on himself and hence a different side emerges after the experiment. Simultaneously, there's Mary Jane, the distant love of Parker, who knows he exists but is dating a much more athletic and popular guy at school. Eventually, these three stories clash in a wonderful and believable climax. Parker becoming a crime-fighting disguised hero, Osborne becoming an adversary of Spider-man, and Dunst caught in the middle.The story is about transformations. All three characters undergo transformation during the course of the story. Not all seem to relish this transformation and none of them understand fully what it means. Some of them embrace the transformation more than others, but in the end it's unclear whether or not the characters are better for what has happened to them. Two survive the transformation while another doesn't. And that's the mark of a great story: when what seems the inevitable outcome isn't quite what the characters and the audience foresaw. Ultimately, it comes down to caring about the characters and what transpires which evolves them into something else, be they heroic or villainous. Maybe that's the problem with many superhero films, the filmmakers forget that we need to be reminded to care about them, not just be awe-struck when they fly around.",NA

"Spider-Man","Movi3DO","11 December 2021","Peter, don't tell Harry. With great power, comes great responsibility.The road to No Way Home begins with the original. I think I never watch the first two Spider-Man movies, which is a shame.This was a solid introduction to the beloved spider-man. Probably the best part was how Peter discovered and learned his power. It was funny and realistic, and I can see how later superhero movies like Shazam was inspired from this. However, I would have preferred for Peter to spend more time discovering his power, as I felt this part was a bit rushed, although it's still good.The character of Peter Parker was well done. He had a down-to-earth background and the way he tried to make money or do things to get his dream girl was both funny and somewhat relatable. His relationship with M. J. was also down-to-earth an cute, and I was rooting for Peter to get his crush.I'm not going to fault the action or the effects much since this was only 2002. The movie would definitely improve with better effects and I would have enjoyed it more.The Green Goblin was not a super stereotypical villain. Defoe was solid in the role with that iconic laugh. His interesting relationship with Peter will set up for the later films.Probably the best character was Jameson, played wonderfully by J. K. Simmons. He didn't get much screen time, but whenever he was on I was always amazed at the charisma and bluntness.Overall, a solid and enjoyable introduction. 7.5/10.",NA
"Spider-Man","buffingtondakota","1 January 2022","This was the first ""Spider-Man"" film that I saw, years ago. I rewatched it this morning (after watching the newest ""Spider-Man"" film ""No Where Home""). The casting was fantastic, the actors were great, the villain was great and fully developed. Some of the special effects didn't hold up too well to date, but honestly that's minor. The story was fully realized and held true to the comic books. The characters were given stories that made sense. Everything was good, a solid film overall. A fun film for kids, teenagers, or adults of any age.",NA
"Spider-Man","vip_ebriega","5 July 2008","My Take: A challenging comic-book summer blockbuster with all the thrills you have come to expect, and more. There's much buzz about this movie before it was released, and even if I unfortunately missed the film in its theatrical release, I managed to catch up. SPIDER-MAN is the ideal summer blockbuster, and the fact that this film was a highly-praised summer attraction is understandable. Packed with state-of-the-art special effects creations that parade in front of the screen like magic, but also powered by a great story and a sharp focus on characters, SPIDER-MAN is a web of gold.Tobey Maguire is ideally cast as Peter Parker who, after being bit by the radioactive spider, is turned from ultimate nerd into the ultimate superhero of the title, but you all know that. But the film makes everything else interesting for the audience. Instead of being just your fairly typical summer event picture, living it up with special effects alone, this one actually has a story to boot, and interesting characters ranging from Parker, his family and the villain, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who turns into the evil Green Goblin. Director Sam Raimi doesn't dumb this one down as a visually exhilarating and incompetently plot-less summer picture. What SPIDER-MAN turns up to be is a terrific roller-coaster ride of an adventure, which gives audiences have much to think about.Although the sum of the parts are often uneven, SPIDER-MAN is still a wild ride of a summer movie that'll knock your socks off. And yes, it does live up to its hype.Rating: **** out of 5.",NA

"Spider-Man","matrixmistro","2 January 2022","No Spider-Man film can touch this, easily the best Spider-Man film so far. Easily the best a to4 fo4 Spider-Man as well. Toby was just made for Spider-Man. When he stopped and the new actors replaced him, things were never the same. The acting and even the story line. The new Spiderman films gap have me bored and almost walking out of the cinema.Andrew Garfield was tithe worse Spider-Man to date. No doubt that's why in comparison it did really bad at th3 box office. Now we've got Tom Holland. He's not bad but he just doesn't do it for me. What's worse is the stories are so silly. The Spider-Man franchise is just boring now. It surprises me though that the new Spider-Man films still do so well at the box office and ratings.It could be the people watching are children and they have low expectations and just seeing a guy in a costume is enough. I have no idea.This Spider-Man has everything. Seeing Peter Parker learn he has super powers is really interesting to watch and satisfying to see him use these powers to fight the bullies and other criminals. I just wished the new movies from Marvel were a# good as the old ones.",NA
