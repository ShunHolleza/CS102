"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Gordon-11","15 December 2021","This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","gbill-74877","31 March 2022","A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it's frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.On the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I'm all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn't care for how na√Øve Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to ""fix"" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","masonsaul","15 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Neptune165","19 March 2022","Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humorless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that ""my back"" joke and Norman Osborn repeating ""I'm something of a scientist myself"". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.This movie certifies that Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility and MCU Spider-Man lacks that. He's had 6 movies and still acts like an inexperienced, immature, not independent, not smart and acts like a rookie. And the whole plot started because he couldn't think of an alternative to get him and his friends to college so he got Doctor Strange to go and make a spell so that everyone will forget that Peter is Spider-Man(also doing it without his friends consent). And of course with Peter being the doofus he is, he messes up the spell which causes the multiverse to collide. There's a reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him. One of Spider-Man's best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears). You'd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains in Far From Home but no; he does it again which caused Aunt May's death. It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be ""cured""(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It's also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you're like ""yeah this guy sucks"" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May's death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben's infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn't even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight.Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","IPyaarCinema","21 December 2021","Review By Kamal KI don't think this film was written well. It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom's Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark's mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter's whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn't experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn't leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the ""jokes"", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom's Peter? Bad writing at its finest.Yes, this whole movie could've been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU's portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland's acting is great.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","BandSAboutMovies","18 December 2021","It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","blott2319-1","24 December 2021","I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post ""Into the Spider-verse"" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was ""really, we're going there?"" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","paul_haakonsen","12 March 2022","Right, well I am by no means a fan of superhero movies, but I will watch them when given the chance. Why? Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don't they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" here in 2022.Actually, my family went to watch ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn't go, as I don't think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.Visually then ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn't it?""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of ""Spider-Man"" in general.My rating of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","16 December 2021","This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D. And once you've seen it, please don't spoil it for others, just like you won't want it spoiled for yourself.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","statuskuo","6 January 2022","It most likely Sony has to continue to soft re-boot this exhausting tedious story in order for them to maintain rights. In this case, it throws the entire kitchen sink including nods to the multiverse.In this one Peter Parker rues the day people discover he is Spiderman. And in order to allow his friends to live a normal life he goes to Dr. Strange to conjure up a spell so he would be forgotten. Seriously. The entire movie is predicated on a stupid wish. Well obviously that goes wrong and a dimension portal opens to different worlds where villains dont recognize the present casted Peter Parker. Seems clever on paper but it is a slog. The only gimmick is that we see Peter Parkers from previous flicks. What you get are momentum killing conversations between the Spideys. Which, for fans, suppose it's great to shoehorn legacy. For people who are too young to know anyone of the previous ones. Im sure theyll be confused.This entire movie moves at a snails pace and suffers from bloat. You can slash a half hour and still be fine. This culminates in the death of Aunt May. Because, if you follow the storylines Spidermans have to have a loved one die at their own stupid decisions. When will that end?I suspected this would be the typical messy CGI garbage. And it didnt disappoint. It is greenscreen heaven.There is a better story here. This one felt unnecessary.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Oh_Capital","19 April 2022","It took me a while to get around to watching No Way Home. There was so much hype, and people were declaring 'the hype is real.'I feel alone on an island thinking this movie is terrible. I get that people were psyched about all the old Spider-Man characters coming together for a big super fun time, but that does not cover up for how nonsensical everything is in this film. (Spoilers incoming)First the good. This will be a short segment. The idea to bring all the characters from the previous Spider-Man movies together through the multiverse is an awesome concept. The execution however was lazily conceived.The two constant problems in the movie are the cringey dialogue and the incomprehensible decision making. The movie starts with Peter Parker's identity being revealed. Now if your identity is revealed where is the last place you want to go? The answer is your house. It appears no one told the writers this because that is where Parker goes. Also, Parker ask's Strange to put a spell on the world so his friends can go to MIT? How is that his rationale? Yes it gives purpose for the rest of the film but it's a lazy story telling way to get there. Why would Dr. Strange agree at all to that. He is a freaking wizard.There is not a single line of dialogue that is intelligent. It's all cliches, lines that have been in previous movies, or just pop culture language with no substance. Towards the end I was cringing at the back and forth between characters, especially when Goblin says ""I'm something of a scientist myself."" Yes we know that when you said it 20 years ago. (I loathe fan service.) There were a couple jokes that landed but overall I was laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny, like when all the Peter Parkers were in the lab with their goggles and test-tubes finding cures for the villains in less than 5 minutes. Again, lazy writing.This is a movie for children who have no concept of reality or care about a well thought out story. (End rant.)","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","FixedYourEnding","20 March 2022","I feel sad to be living in a time where a movie like this can get high ratings. This movie is for low-attention-span adrenaline-immuned viewers, which unfortunately there are more and more of. Unless you are a group of teenagers looking for a night-out, I would not recommend this movie at all.I didn't expect much from this movie other to be an entertaining comic-book-like story. Boy, was I disappointed. It has been no more than a collection of random fight scenes with incoherent story and almost random dialogues in-between. Also, I think the casting of Spider-man, M. J. and Aunt May are just horrible. Tom Holland appears to have the brain of a 10-year old, and Zendaya is great in other films, but as MJ she just doesn't work, same goes for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) she looks way too young, flirty and brainless, exact opposite of what this character should be.Overall it is a slaughterhouse to everything that spider-man should stand for. It is concentrated around universes and egocentric personal problems instead of being a moral model of real-world problems. The 2.5 hours long movie seem to just be an adrenaline shot one after the other, no substance and nothing to learn from. I'm sadden by having to write this, the production quality is great but where is a plot, a moral and generally being a better person. Sony should be ashamed of themselves for dragging Stan Lee's creation through the mud like that and Marvel should consider terminating their license for this creation. Seriously.","

Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kosmasp","20 December 2021","There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many ""climactic"" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where ""magic"" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ...","

The special effects are as expected great but the rest is really a bunch of nonsense!I love Spider-man, Batman, the Hulk etc but this movie is really terrible and I wasted 148minutes precious time.Take my word for it: the best thing to do is to skip this movie and wait for something better to watch, which is not hard as there are not many movies as dumb as this one!","

I wasn't expecting something quite as amazing as this, this was two and a half hours of incredible entertainment, drama, laughs, tears and action galore, there truly was something for everyone here.This movie really has ignited my love for the franchise once again, and I am truly excited for what comes next.Nostalgia, there seems to be a real thirst for it these days, and there is a lot of it to enjoy here. There are plenty of moments throughout that will have you speechless, they really do break all of the rules here.This is one incredibly good looking movie, dazzling special effects, dizzying action scenes, two and a half hours will literally fly by.Incredible, 10/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Criticalstaff","14 March 2022","It might be the worst movie ever made. Not just because it is bad, but because of the misuse of all the resources that went into making it.I will be the first to admit that I have propensity to look for meaning when I am watching a film. Be it the straight-forward moral of the story or a higher meaning, something to make you think. That is how I enjoy cinema the most, when it gives me something to think about. Big or small. When the images on the screen are about something more than simply the images on the screen.This film is the complete opposite of it. Its meaning is inward-looking. It is not interested of looking at anything other than itself. It is complete and utter navel-gazing. That really is the crux of the film. That is the reason why this is barely watchable. Every flaw and mistake comes from this movie's own excessive self-contemplation.Where to put the blame is a different question. It has been established for some time that these MCU films are not ""directed"". There is no singular vision behind them and it boils down to an assembly line. The plot and dialogue are so bad I can't imagine anyone put any amount of thought into it. All the lines do actually feel like ad-libs the actors improvised on the day. Visually there is an absence of flair (and I am being generous) which is on par for the course for these movies by now. The soundtrack and sound design is, of course, forgettable. The editing is conventional. The set design is reminiscent of those real-estate videos where celebrities show their homes. The costume design is ok, again which is not shocking knowing the means that were allocated to this.The acting could have been the saving grace of the movie. Unfortunately, Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are the stars of the film. And while their performances are good, they usually have to share the screen with (multiple) Oscar-winners. It is jarring to see the best talent doing what is basically glorified background work. That is why this is the worst movie of all time. You have a film packed with the best actors working today, but we have to follow Tom Holland's inane struggle on how to apply to some college.I am not even sure I want to go into the plot. In truth it does not matter. I suspect that even the makers of this took that as a given. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now morphed into a never ending reference and call-backs machine. That is the core of this film: ""remember this?!"" The structure of it is one of a TV show, except in TV there is an A-plot and a B-plot. This film is all B-plot.As I am writing this, this film has been viewed by millions and is one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Please kill me now.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mhorg2018","20 December 2021","This is the best film Marvel has released this year. Shang-Chi was only ok, the Venom sequel was atrocious, Black Widow was so-so, Eternals was bland for the most part. What makes this one work is the cast, but the story really, when examined is weak. The last movie put the writers in a corner while revealing (a silly idea really) Peter's identity to the world. He goes to Doctor Strange without thinking about what he really wants, and ends up, in typical spider-man fashion, in screwing everything up. So, also in usual Spider-Man style, by trying to fix things up, he totally messes up further. In the end this costs him a lot. While this movie starts out well, the middle is dull and why should Peter care about beings from alternate realities? And by 'fixing' them, did he erase the events of those films, making the spider-men of those realities unnecessary? Peter loses everything due to his listening to Aunt May, who's advice is illogical and gets her killed. Well, I can say this was the best of Holland's trilogy, but it still isn't Spider-Man 2. A few sides: Molina, Garfield and Maguire's returns were the best part of this movie. Those three steal every single scene they're in. Dafoe was good as Norman, but I could have done without Electro and Sandman who added little to the story. While others are falling over themselves gushing over this, I think I may be suffering from Superhero fatigue.","

I was so happy to see my childhood come to life.This was a incrediblely told story about The 3 peters and how deep responsibility truly is, I'm shocked with excitement in we had the great men themselves return to their respective roles which included Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Thomas Haden church and many more. I've always been a massive fan of Tobey & Andrew so seeing them come back was the ultimate time of my life. I loved every second of it, i wanted to review this with no spoilers but that is literally impossible ao i now have +1 Spoiler review.There were so many nods and callbacks to the past which i thoight went very well & Garfield finally avenged not saving gwen!Highly Recommend!

Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.A heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.A memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.""Rating: A.","

What it does deliver is plenty of spectacle. But a great film needs more than that. The story also moves along with some pace. But emotional impact should never be sacrificed for expediency. In short, this is an enjoyable film, but there have been better Marvel films.There is one scene that stands above the rest. And it is guaranteed to bring a smile to the lips of any Marvel fan. It has so much subtext and it is so unexpected.It ends with a tee-up for the next chapter, of course. I just hope that one focuses more on the characters and less on the effects. It certainly has that possibility, given where this episode ends.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","EpicMovieCompilations","16 December 2021","When Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire enter the movie, the cinema rightfully erupts into a hail of cheers and applause. The experience of Spider-Man: No Way Home is bizarre. Not only do you spend half the runtime just waiting for the return of a familiar face, but grow weary of the current cast which've headlined the previous MCU entires. Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon cannot hope to carry a film on its own terms, therefore No Way Home relies and depends on the presence of legacy. Far From Home (2019) was borderline unwatchable. Cheap-looking, tone-deaf and accompanied by a forced, cringeworthy romance (which doesn't improve here by the way) it is surely the worst Spider-Man movie of all time. This threequel holds the unfortunate title of runner-up. It shares many of the same problems...First of all; technicalities. As with most MCU movies, the cinematography is flat and the colour palette is dulled for no apparent reason. The action set-pieces aren't very inventive and hold no iconography, always taking place on a boring, painfully obvious green-screened environment. Why does the Statue of Liberty look like that!? Why has the Lizard's design regressed from 2012, and why do they recycle and super-impose B-Roll footage of Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman, or Rhys Ifans as Curt Conners? It's so lazy.Aunt May's death barely affects me emotionally, because thus far she's been portrayed as this bubbly, whimsical character with very few scenes of actual conviction. Can you imagine if this was Rosemary Harris or Sally Fields' Aunt May? The difference in my reaction would be night and day. Moral of the story, don't cast the most gorgeous woman alive as Aunt May... Speaking of conviction, why does this film feel the need to inject a cheap gag whenever it's in proximity to a remotely serious scene? These screenwriters have to go back to basics, and refresh themselves on the fundamentals of tone. Not to mention, most of the MCU's humour so infrequently lands, and caters to the lowest common denominator audiences. That's not to say there aren't a few smart quips here or there, but for the most part, I was confused by the amount of chuckles surrounding me.No Way Home is, clinically, a bad movie. Take for instance, the First Act. Much of the world wants Spider-Man hunted down and defeated. He's interrogated once, and then freed on behalf of a pointless cameo by Daredevil himself, Matthew Murdock. Like, what? There's no ramifications. He just gets to live his life despite being an enemy of the state. Does the world think he partook in a terrorist plot or do they think he snatched a candy from a convenience store? I'm a little confused. I guess the consequence is that Ned and MJ don't get into MIT... Big deal. I don't care. These are poorly written characters. Bring on the multiverse villains!What can I say on that front..? I was grinning from ear-to-ear in seeing Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina), Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) back again. Hearing their musical cues gave me goosebumps, as did some of their dialogues... It's a testament to the actors. There's some serious talent in The Sinister Six. I love their interactions. For a second you'll think to yourself how cool it all is, how you should just be thankful a film like this is even possible... But again, why have it at all if it isn't done correctly? Take for instance, the final battle, with one of the glaring objective errors of the film... Tobey's swingin' around, pulling off epic Spidey stunts, and there's no hint of Danny Elfman's beautiful theme... Same goes for Andrew Garfield, who had the privilege of having two great themes by James Horner and Hans Zimmer respectively. What was Michael Giacchino thinking!? He already dabbled in old themes for the villains, so why not for the heroes? If the movie is dead-set on fan-service and and legacy (which it most certainly is) then why on Earth not include these terrific tunes? Instead we just get orchestral renditions of Tom Holland's theme, which utterly PALES in comparison! It's just the same progression of notes.On to the Spider-Men themselves... Andrew Garfield has probably solidified himself as my favourite after watching this, while Tobey Maguire remains legendary by default since he was my childhood Spidey. Tom Holland doesn't come close. I never liked him in the role because he's not tangible. He's too pure and honest; thereby becoming illegitimate as a realistic humanistic interpretation. For whatever reason, Tobey Maguire gets stabbed, fatally it seems, by the Green Goblin. Thing is, he survives... So why bother scaring us? The moment doesn't serve a purpose, other than to provide a sudden, stupid shock for the poor audience. Ultimately, each of the villains fade away, back to their own universes. It's totally anti-climactic, not to mention there's no rematch or even a solid dialogue exchange between the Green Goblin and Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. Malpractice from a storytelling standpoint; odd, considering that on the other hand you have a terrific scene where Andrew's Spider-Man catches MJ from falling to her death, as he failed to do so with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)... Does narrative closure not apply to all facets of these films? Or did the writers just get forgetful for Tobey? Either way, the ending leaves much to be desired and leaves you wondering: what was the point?Individually, scenes work well. But this isn't a clip show. It's a film. To conclude, No Way Home is a mess. One which nearly totally collapses prior to Andrew and Tobey's appearance. Their scenes are fantastic, and all criticisms aside for one minute, I am grateful I got to see 'em on the big screen one last time. I love it when they bond over shared losses, and Andrew and Tobey's little exchange in the lab... No Way Home is an occasional treat, however nonsensical and pointless on the whole.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","alindsayal","15 December 2021","Finally, the biggest film Spider-Man: No Way Home has hit cinemas and I had to go see it as early as possible. Now I have watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Man's secret identity revealed, he tries to get Doctor Strange's help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause problems for both of them.Main Character
Tom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see how he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world. He doesn't have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I thought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.Supporting Characters
Zendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything that goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels natural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really good, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some really interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character. Jacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character that supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is back as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce off and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in their roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.Story
The story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of a character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for me was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their characters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.Script
MCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is really handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didn't outweigh the serious and darker parts of the film.Style
The film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from the other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good, despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isn't really any filler here which is an impressive feat.Overall
Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I have just watched the film but I can't find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will find this film plenty of fun.Rating - 10/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","JohnDeSando","17 December 2021","Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Peter (Tom Holland): ""The problem is you trying to live two different lives. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it becomes!""Notwithstanding the ""home"" in the title, the exciting new Spider-Man: No Way Home is more about the existential need to create one's own identity, the Christian need to give up a life in order to gain it, and the human need for a second chance. Many super-hero movies continue to emphasize the hero's need to recover a parent or child even more than the need to sacrifice for the good of humankind.As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggles with the attention he gets because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) revealed his identity, he gets involved with Dr. Strange to erase his super-hero identity from everyone's memory. Fooling with Mother Nature never is good in these hyper-active fantasies, and it's true as Peter tries to get Dr. Strange to reverse his initial memory-erasing spell in order to remain in the minds of those he loves.Besides, what director Jon Watts and his writers are really interested in is pulling the three Spidies together (Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) to remediate former bad boys like The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Strange clears the way between parallel dimensions to let each Spidey's version of villains to come together for their cleansing.The imaginative and entertaining concept of getting these characters together proves not to be confusing but revealing of their generous natures and the benign fraternity of Spider-Men, adding the collaboration motif into their otherwise solitary lives.Although the digital gymnastics are impressive, beyond those is an attempt to flesh out character for both good and bad boys. Discoveries abound without super sentimentality or long exposition. Because the filmmakers have taken care to load meaning into most dialogue, the revealing third act takes the plot to dizzying heights while character spills out along the way.As more is found out about the heroes and the villains, the long road back to normalcy for Peter seems just about right, filled as it is with triumphs that come from working as a team (not a normal Spidey thing to do) to suffering the loss of dear ones to a better cause. It's a coming of age at any age and a satisfying display of character development that might be envied by indie films everywhere whose bread and butter is a similar attempt to show humans at their worst and best.Super holiday fare, yes; challenging, yes; amazed I am that comic-book stuff holds meaning amidst its visual splendor, yes.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","hellsbells75","2 January 2022","I watched this with no prior knowledge of the plot. I had heard rumours but not enough, so each cameo was a genuine surprise for me. Even with that element, I was left dejected.Why? Well, first of all it made no sense. It seemed a ridiculously contrived way of bringing back old villains and actors just for the nostalgia and fan nods without any real premise. It makes no sense that the all powerful all knowing Dr Strange would risk the stability of the universe to get a few kids into college. He knows far too much about actions and consequences to fall into that trap.And Peter's ridiculous idea to save the villains he doesn't know, who belong in another universe, and who have done despicable things to his own alter egos, using what...some science stuff that just happens to be in Happy's apartment? We never know quite how he builds these ""cures"", we just get blinded by movie science talk enough to understand that it's ""science"". Just like Peter trapping Dr Strange in the Mirror Dimension by using ""math"". It's like those old 80s movies where a computer whiz taps random things into a computer and it can do amazing things! How? We don't know, just shut up and eat your popcorn!The dialogue fell oddly flat too. I'm a Marvel fan and I enjoy the witty banter, one liners and emotional moments but this fell way short for me. The jokes weren't funny. The interplay between characters felt written by a kid trying to emulate Marvel wit. I just didn't feel it. The 3 Peters answering to Ned calling their name was just rubbish. It simply wasn't funny.And the sentimentality felt forced and false. They all cried so many times. Soaring music over the top. Tears and hugs and therapy. It descended into pathetic, and I didn't want to see good characters being pathetic. I get the angst and pain in previous movies but this was pointless and Peter literally destroyed everything including his last remaining family member over nothing. At least the other Peters' regrets were real. This was borne out of pure nonsensical decision making. He wanted to kill The Green Goblin. Why? He was only there because of Peter making ridiculous choices and Aunt May only died because she was as stupid and misguided as Peter. He was just doing what villains do given half a chance - a chance Peter gave him for no logical reason.The fact he saved them in the end was irrelevant and actually did a massive disservice to the previous movies. It devalues what those other Peters did and went through. You may as well cure them too by stopping them getting bitten by spiders in the first place if you're going to be that kind hearted and change history.Would those villains really want to go back to their universe a changed person anyway? They were flawed, broken and destroyed everything they loved. Now they get to go back all ""fixed""...to what? A broken destroyed world they ruined to no doubt face justice for it. Great, thanks Peter! I think their glorious deaths would have been better. Or are the other Spidermen supposed to smooth it all over when they return?And last but not least, the whole ""forget everyone knows who Spider-Man is"" thing is just crazy. As if Dr Strange hasn't learned enough from trying to do it the first time. Why forget Peter Parker completely? Why not just forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man so he keeps his friends etc? So there was Happy at Aunt May's grave not knowing this was her nephew? That makes no sense at all. What happened at the Statue of Liberty then? What did MJ and Ned remember?I came out of the theatre disappointed. It wasn't like MJ said. I actually expected not to be disappointed, which made it worse.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","akoaytao1234","12 March 2022","It would be unfair to say that I never really laud as great films BUT I always admire this ability to create quality escapism.With all that, I think Spider-Man: No Way Home might be the first film of that series that I actually hate .Firstly, this film feels so juvenile to the point that it is annoying. I guess this is a film not really made for me. I found the way Hollands tries to plays up the good boy persona exceedingly off-putting AND not needed. Zendaya and the Filipino guy are just a figment on its story. They even tried to gentrify the ""other"" versions of Spiderman film. Funnily, I love all the treatment for the Original Spiderman characters. Otherwise, its a mixed bag.Secondly, I found the cause of conflict in the film so unnecessary. It does not make sense for me why and how it happened. It feels like watching a cash grab for fans.I mean the conflict of the film is that his presence as a superhero has such a negative effects to their live that they were ultimately banned to their collegiate school BUT it is contrast with a rally showing their popularity too. It is like be consistent film. Even the spell is hinged on the fact that they did not plan. They go on as if this is a thing he does every time BUT he just goes for it without really thinking through of the whatnots. Ultimately, the choice of Holland Peter to armchair psychologist ughh. Just watch it, its like a Bob the Builder-esque plot line.Ultimately, what really sour me about the film is the Dr Strange Conundrum. Why even watch when the consequences can be reversed and played on? I mean, he did had some in the end BUT is it really not deserved. As a viewer, I hate it from since the Avenger films BUT I hate it more so this time, because it actively says it can AND it can even personalize it.Overall, this is a pure cash grab for people who are watching it for the characters but not the content. Its pretty much anchored on a very weak premise AND feels like a connective tissue for things to come. [0.5/5]","

What does this accomplish that's so special? They obviously wracked their writers brains to the point of mediocrity to settle for this very cheap excuse to combine all the different movie Spider-Mans in one movie apparently for the sake of novelty, because the story serves absolutely no purpose, AND it just resets everything for Tom Holland's Spider-Man, which makes the previous 2 films really inconsequential, on top of creating a dilemma for any future possibilities of featuring all of those villains we've now just seen, which technically Tom Holland could have had versions of in his own franchise. This film was a waste of time, and one of the very worst in the entire Marvel series. In my opinion, everyone involved in coming up with this concept should be fired.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","potipiroon","26 December 2021","I decided to go see this movie because of the 8.9 rating, which was based on more than 200,000 reviews. Honestly, I am shocked. The movie was so boring that I actually fell asleep at one point. The plot was very childish and unnecessarily long. I heard that some people actually left the theater out of boredom. I assume the high rating was only possible because of such strong a fandom. Overall, I felt like I just lost 2.5 hours of my life.","

Sure some of the comedy doesn't quite hit, there are some pacing troubles and not every character has enough screen time to flesh out their character.But despite its problems, this film excels at listening to the fans and giving a spider-man movie that will be remembered as ending an era just as endgame is remembered for the avengers.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","drqshadow-reviews","18 March 2022","Instantly loathing the publicity of being outed by the press, Spider-Man hits up the Sanctum Sanctorum to ask Dr. Strange for some mystical assistance. They cast a spell of wiped memory and screw it up, reality is torn, familiar faces invade different spaces... you know this, you've seen the trailer. It's the Sony/MCU equivalent of X-Men: Days of Future Past, with a stream of old band members coming out of retirement for a jam-packed farewell concert.One might hope that the results are a smidge better than that old X-Men reunion, and they are, but No Way Home also suffers from many of the same problems. Primarily, the overwhelming urge to stuff as much crap on the screen as possible, even when the audience is already exhausted. It tries to serve too many masters and, in the end, sufficiently serves none. There's fun to be had, especially when the oddball mix-and-match super-characters get the chance to escape the trappings of a broader storyline and simply converse as individuals. Those accessible human interactions have been a big strength for the two preceding Marvel Spider-Man flicks, and they reap great benefits here, each time the old guard mingles with the new.I wish we had more such moments, but the push to turn the MCU's most grounded franchise into another big-time tent pole attraction demands otherwise. In reaching for the next major event, they've overlooked the ""neighborhood"" part of ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man."" Actually, they might've forgotten the ""friendly"" part, too, because there's a whole bunch of angst spinning around Tom Holland's central performance. But that's more excusable: Peter Parker goes through a lot over the course of this hundred-fifty minutes, he progresses and matures as a character, and he's experienced equally dark times in the comics.No, the performances aren't the issue here, nor is the dialogue, which remains snappy and delightful. The primary culprit is the plot, bloating and careening in indeterminate (and often mindless) directions, making a lot of noise but not making a lot of sense. Dr. Strange hand-waves many explanations under the guise of mysticism, which is basically his thing, but so do the various Spider-Men. Important members of the supporting cast are marginalized and under-served. The city of New York, once an essential ingredient, is now barely a backdrop. Goalposts are moved, overshadowed, and then moved again. Rumor has it that script re-writes were still underway during filming, and it shows.This is messy. Lots of fun on certain occasions, but stifling and sludgy in others. It's a mixed bag, leaning more to the positive than the negative, but I don't know that I'm content with the way everything wraps up in the end. Where Homecoming and Far From Home both left me charged and anxious for the next step, No Way Home put me in a place of quiet acceptance. Feels like the franchise has aged, and that's not a great thing.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","akdjreview","15 December 2021","Following constant disappointment with Marvel movies, I had come to stop caring for or even watching any. But Spider-man has had a special place in my heart since a kid so I had to watch, especially after hearing rumours. To tell the truth, this exceeded my expectations with great power.With surprisingly good acting and great emotionally loaded scenes, No Way Home managed to capture something many Marvel movies fail. Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a story-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting never seen in the Marvel universe before.No Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which I think old fans will admire. Nevertheless, I believe this movie was fantastically done and little mistakes.No Way Home is a great movie I highly recommend. Especially to the Marvel fans like me that had gotten bored of the new stuff.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","lareval","15 December 2021","I do not think this is a totally perfect film: It is too damn easily to spoil it, probably the middle section is not as powerful as the start and the epic finale, some of the characters are thrown into the plot rather than enjoy a well developed evolution like Peter Parker himself and I was not exactly a fan of Holland's era due to a lackluster couple of previous solo films. But this third solo movie is his best film to date, one of the most impactful MCU & Superhero movies and one outing that redeems and answers all my complaints regarding what came before.Here, MCU's Peter Parker finally shows some cracks and faces true trauma, developing a true commitment to his own adventure even being extremely populated by plenty of beloved and nostalgic other ones. Here, Parker's Spider-Man finally gets to grown in me, being faithful to the source and ending his evolution within Avengers universe on a riprousingly high. The performances are really strong, the script covers its plotholes & weaknesses with energy, tragedy and fun so well mixed and the ending looks like a true ending to Holland's Spider-Man trilogy.An excellent entertainment and a shocking surprise. I did not buy any trailer nor stinger from this movie and I was blown away. Best Spider-Man movie tied with 'Spider-Verse' and Sam Raimi's 2004 sequel. See it now!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","evanston_dad","11 February 2022","""Spider-Man"" fans are going to have a total nerdgasm over this movie. Those of us who haven't seen all the Spider-Man movies and aren't knowledgeable about the Marvel universe may have a good time but also might be left wondering what all the hoopla is about.I only saw the first two Tobey Maguire Spider-Mans and didn't see any of the Andrew Garfield ones, but Tom Holland is definitely my favorite actor to play him. This movie is too bogged down by exposition and has a saggy middle section that tries for heart-tugging drama -- why, why do these junk food movies try to be more serious than they should? -- but I will admit that the ending gave me the feels. I'm not really chomping at the bit to see where this story goes next, but it was fun enough seeing this movie with my 10 year old son.Grade: B.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Anurag-Shetty","16 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home takes place immediately after the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home(2019). After Mysterio reveals Peter Parker's(Tom Holland) true identity, Peter's world is turned upside down. Peter goes to Doctor Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch), to make the world forget he's Spider-Man. However, the spell goes awry & villains from the multiverse show up. Now, Peter will find out what it truly means to be Spider-Man.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an awe-inspiring film. Director Jon Watts has perfectly completed his Spider-Man trilogy. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The humor & the emotional scenes are on point, just like every other Spidey movie. You will cry, laugh and cheer till your voice gets hoarse. Tom Holland is spectacular as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Tom Holland further solidifies that his portrayal of the iconic superhero, is the best. Zendaya is outstanding as MJ. Holland & Zendaya share electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Jacob Batalon is superb as Ned Leeds. Jamie Foxx is brilliant as Max Dillon/Electro. Willem Dafoe is phenomenal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Dafoe proves yet again, why he's the best Spider-Man villain in the entire franchise. Alfred Molina is excellent as Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus. Thomas Haden Church is great as Flint Marko/Sandman. Rhys Ifans is impressive as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a must watch for die-hard and casual Spider-Man fans. Go & web up a whale of a time!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","johnnyhbtvs27","16 December 2021","Went to see this opening day to avoid spoilers and boy was i pleased i did. Going in not knowing what was going to happen made the movie so much better. Seeing Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire & Tom Holland all together really is a fans dream and Marvel are giving so much fan service in all their movies lately it really is staggering.I feel most of all, the movie does well in giving Andrew Garfield some love as the Spider-Man character as he mostly gets a raw deal these days as his movies weren't as strong as Raimi's or MCU ones. Andrew Garfield was a good Peter Parker & Spider-Man, he just didn't get that film where he could really shine and this movie practically says as much.Managing to get so many villains to reprise their roles must have been a tall order (i was more surprised to see Thomas Hayden Church back than anyone).The story grips you right from the off as it takes place immediately after the second one & some of the twists and turns i found quite shocking (i should have known better about Aunt May but it still took me by surprise).The ending is really beautiful in a nice sort of way, seeing Peter interact with MJ after the fact is a real heartstring puller. It ends with a conclusion to the trilogy whilst leaving the door ajar for more Tom Holland Spider-Man movies (which if there is any justice, there will be).Tom Hardy's cameo at the end sets up Venom (or at the very least, a version of) to join the MCU, which should be a blast. The idea of Tom Hardy & Holland playing off of each other is cinematic gold.All in all, i think this is the strongest MCU Spider-Man movie and may be the ultimate one for massive Spider-Man fans. Sam Raimi could never have imagined 20 years ago whilst making Spider-Man (2002) that his characters would be still portraying themselves all these years later in the biggest cinematic universe and franchise ever, truly remarkable, just like this film.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","MrDHWong","16 December 2021","""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is the third solo Spider-Man movie to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Tom Holland once again in the lead role, it goes without saying that this is the best live action Spider-Man film ever made and probably ever will be made for that matter.In the events after ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", the secret identity of Peter Parker (Tom Holland) as Spider-Man has been exposed to the entire world after his fight with Quentin Beck/Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). No longer being able to take the onslaught of media and public backlash, Peter seeks help from Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. However, during the casting of the spell, Peter accidentally causes things to go wrong, fracturing the multiverse and leading to the emergence of many villains from realities unfamiliar to this one.Aside from Batman, the superhero that has left the most impact on me personally is Spider-Man. In fact, the very first superhero film I ever saw at the cinema was the 2002 Sam Raimi-directed ""Spider-Man"" starring Tobey Maguire. I'd probably go as far to say it is that film I credit with helping to kick-start my fondness for the genre as a whole, paving the way for many others like it. With ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" acknowledging not only the original Raimi films but the Marc Webb-directed, Andrew Garfield-led ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films as well, there was bound to be a lot of speculation surrounding whether or not it could live up to all this hype. In short, the answer is a resounding yes.Not since ""Avengers: Endgame"" has a Marvel superhero film affected me on such an emotional level and not since the 2008 ""Iron Man"" film has a solo hero story left this much of an impact. Of course, to discuss my favourite parts would give away vital spoilers so I won't go into too much detail here. I absolutely love the amount of respect paid to each of these series of films. Even the divisive ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films, which I actually liked despite their flaws, are treated with just as much love and affection as their Raimi/MCU counterparts. Moments like these go beyond simple fanservice and are clearly there as a thank you to everyone who have stuck with this iconic hero for almost twenty years now. They certainly put a big smile on the face of this responsible 30-something adult.The concept of the multiverse was first teased back in ""Avengers: Endgame"" and further elaborated on in the Disney+ series ""Loki"". However, for the most part, those ventures had a proper sense of management preventing things from spiralling out of control. Here, everything feels like fair game. The stakes are at an all time high as these villains pour out from their respective universes to seek vengeance on their particular Peter Parker, not knowing that they won't find him here at all. Anyone who knows me will remember that I love stories that involve alternate realities and history, so to see something like this combined with a film about one of my favourite superheroes was nothing short of wonderful. This film keeps you on your toes as you anticipate who Spider-Man will fight next. Again, I won't reveal which of the villain fights excited me the most due to spoilers so all I will say is that each of them had at least one moment that made the young kid inside me very happy.Tom Holland has come a long way since we first saw him don the Spider-Man suit back in ""Captain America: Civil War"". His high-spirited youthfulness has not waned over the past five years since he still has that uncanny ability to entertain us with his unique take on the beloved hero. That's not to say he is only capable of light-hearted fun, as here we see him demonstrate some of his darkest acting to date. This film definitely isn't afraid to hit us hard in the feels at the most appropriate times, frequently delving deep into Peter Parker's emotional state at such an important point in his life.Additionally, I have finally come to accept Zendaya's performance as MJ. It has taken me three films but her version of the character has finally grown on me. Originally, I found her pessimistic attitude and willingness to bring the mood down highly annoying but she has now matured into a vital ally of Peter that I enjoy seeing on screen. Naturally, her chemistry with Holland feels genuine, considering the two actors are actually dating in real life with their romantic scenes adding that much needed heart to the film.I won't speak at length about any specific villain as that will give away major spoilers so all I will say is that seeing each of them again in one place was quite overwhelming, but this time in a good way. It's both amusing and surprising to see Raimi-era villains interact with Webb-era villains who are equally as confused as to why they have been transported into this universe. Something that certain Spider-Man films have come under fire for is their cramming of too many villains into one movie, leaving the story cluttered and incomprehensible. This time around, it actually works to the film's advantage since the idea of there being multiple universes following a different timeline has already been properly established. Something like this leaves things open for other multiverse-related oddities happening in future MCU projects, which excites me greatly.Since the film has set the bar so high, I can't help but wonder how the MCU will ever be able to top it. Like ""Avengers: Endgame"" before it, ""No Way Home"" should be treated as something of a watershed moment in the entire MCU. It succeeds in entertaining both longtime fans of the Spider-Man character who have been watching him for nearly twenty years while simultaneously serving the purpose as a great continuation of the ever-expanding MCU storyline. With that said, I think all fans of Spider-Man owe it to themselves to see this film as soon as possible. And yes, I do mean ALL fans.I rate it a solid 9/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","leestoych","17 December 2021","If this movie didn't have the 3 boys joining forces it would've been a 6/10 for me. What we got was a shaky plot with Ned whipping out doctor strange moves after 0 training and peter risking the universe collapsing for the lives of a few random villains. Lazy lazy writingAnd the end fight we had maybe 10 seconds of our 3 Spider-Men fighting together. The rest was choppy scenes of each character fighting their respective villians. Where was the unity? Thats what we wanted, some combo moves between the 3 at least :(There were obviously some great moments dont get me wrong but i feel people aren't really taking the movie for what it is. Deluded by the marvel hypeThis is what happens when the hype is too big. What was MJ's line on disappointment? Yeah it applies to this film.My 4 main issues...1. Ned mastering the Doctor Strange Ring instantly (0 training)
2. Peter's decision to steal the cube from doctor strange because he wanted to ""cure"" a few villains and consequently risk his universe
3. Needed a few more scenes where the spidermen fight in unison ( we got 10 seconds of them swinging together)
4. Tobey's entrance was lame and should've been utilised during the end fight.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","thesar-2","20 December 2021","For the first time in nearly 20 years, I may have seen my favorite Spider-Man movie.And I'm not like a kid who loves the Ice Age movies and since part 17 is the newest one they've seen, it's their favorite. (Much like what they said about the 16 before it.) Nope. I sat from almost the first 10 minutes LOVING this movie and debating if this actually beat out the magnificent 2002's Spider-Man and its even better follow-up, 2004's Spider-Man 2.I will say this: This is my new 2nd favorite of ALL 27 MCU movies. Easy. And it's easily in the top three of the 10 theatrical-released Spider-Man movies. In fact, since part 2 in 2004, I have not been impressed with any of the Spider-Man movies until Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse and this third Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I barely liked Tom's Spider-Man: Homecoming and I refer to it Iron Man Jr because it was WAY more about Iron Man smarts and involvement and it clearly made Peter a complete moron who couldn't lift a finger or figure out anything on his own without big-daddy Tony helping. Tom's Spider-Man: Far From Home was better, but it still couldn't let go of Tony (EVEN after his character supposedly left the franchise.) This second rebooted version of Spider-Man of Tom Holland's made me sad, because of how dumb Peter is and how reliant he is on others, namely big-daddy Tony. This is NOT the brilliant Peter Parker I grew up with.But, FINALLY...they got it right with Tom's third movie. The trailer spoiled SO MUCH of this movie and the actors involved, as trailers are designed to be spoiler packed (usually the very last scene of the movie is in the trailer,) so I won't even go into the synopsis or what happens or who's in it. I just HIGHLY encourage you to see this ASAP and know: they FINALLY got Spider-Man right. After 5 disappointing follow-ups to Spider-Man 2, THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I laughed so hard, even though it wasn't like the traditional MCU movie where it's mostly a comedy. These were genuine jokes and not just inserted to please the audience who apparently wants more comedic MCU movies than action-packed Super-Hero movies. I cried a bit, even though it's mostly an uplifting movie. And yes, I marveled on how well acted and written this film is. Everybody gave it their 110% and no one stole scenes or out-performed anyone else. This was MY Endgame event.I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.I heard they're building a new trilogy with Tom Holland continuing his role as Spidey. To be frank, before this viewing, I almost didn't want to see them. If this turned out just slightly better than Tom's 2nd one which was just slightly better than his mediocre 1st one, I was pretty much done.Now, my Spidey-Sense is tingling to see what they have in store for us next.","

The story of the whole movie is Spiderman asks dr strange to make the world forget him. And the rest of the movie is about the villains that show up basically just joking around having fun and trying to kill Spiderman. Reacting to the story without really adding anything to it.The rest of the movie has a lot of plot holes. A whole Lot. Like for the movie to happen Spiderman has to suddenly think he can cure mental illness. And To suddenly realize that the giant lizard man was left behind in the van. Maybe we was going to go to the 7-11 and bring back a mountain dew. Who know what they were thinking. But this scene and others like it feel so forced and does not happen naturally.The spells and how they backfire make zero sense..but we could debate that all day.I feel like the most wasted opportunity was to not bring Gwen Stacy back from the dead to reunite with Garfield Spiderman. Everyone else was dead .its not a leap to say Gwen could come back too. And of Course No James Franco...a huge wasted opportunity.Overall not the best marvel movie. But not the worst.","

It's the jumping off point for Marvel movies to do what they do best, and No Way Home doesn't disappoint, thanks to that tried and true formula of good-natured banter and giddy CGI set pieces. I liked how it taps into Electro's awesome power. I kind of imagined that Electro, played by Jamie Foxx, perhaps, and this is a big perhaps, could be a crime-fighting consultant in some future movie. And Willem Dafoe gave a tortured performance as Norman Osborn, fighting hard to silence the diabolical inner voice of Green Goblin.All Marvel pictures have non-preachy messaging. No Way Home touches on grief, vengeance, and also makes a case for humanity's redemptive nature.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Prismark10","28 January 2022","Spider-Man enters the multiverse. After Peter Parker's identity is exposed by J Jonah Jameson.Peter seeks out Doctor Strange to return him back to anonymity. The spell goes wrong.Certain villains return, they seem to know Spiderman. He just does not know them.Taking off from the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home. This movie has a slower first act as Peter is pursued both by the media and law enforcement.When a blind lawyer shows up it is the first nod that this movie has a lot that will appeal to Spidey fans.The motivations of some of the villains look weak and confused. However it is all there for one thing. The return of the other Spidermen.Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield return with their Spidersuits and it is a punch the air moment.It really is a joy to see the merging of the previous incarnations of the Spiderman franchise. The older Tobey Maguire works well dressed as a trendy youth counsellor. Garfield has issues regarding loneliness and he might have found some closure in this film.This might be the best Spiderman movie since the Maguire era.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","aidanratesmovies","18 December 2021","It has some minor flaws here and there- but Spider-Man No Way Home is easily the best Spider-Man film to date- successfully capturing the energy and spirit of the franchises past with an entirely new direction. One of the few things I noticed while watching this film is how intimate it was with the audience. More than ever we begin to see things from Peter's point of view, and it sculpts a very touching and emotional narrative that is easily the best execution in a Marvel property in a while. While there are some small things I think they could have touched up a bit better, this film was massively entertaining, incredibly funny, and surprisingly very emotional in the best way possible. It blends the past characters so well into its story you hardly feel it's their first time in the universe. Even more, it's such a unique experience to finally see 3 generations of superhero fans unite for such an epic opportunity- of which seems more than well done- almost too good to be true at times. It may not be perfect, but personally- I loved nearly every minute of it, and can't wait to see what this franchise continues to offer down the road.My Rating: 9.5/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","cherold","1 April 2022","No Way Home starts with as much silliness as any Spider-Man movie in history. Peter Parker, unmasked, asks Doctor Strange to make everyone forget him, then hedges, then everything gets weird as a bunch of bad guys from previous Spider-Man movie series start wreaking havoc.The multiverse is, of course, a major component of Into the Spider-verse, but while that was brilliant and cool, here it comes across as profoundly silly.So in my head I was seeing this as the silliest of all Spider-man movies; a ludicrous romp with fun mindless action. And then, in a weird tonal shift, the movie gets really dark, and then tries to go back to the light-hearted bit with that hanging over it, and does some more really silly stuff, and some rather confused but fast-paced action, and then goes for a sad thing that I found kinda boring, and, well, what is this supposed to *be*.It doesn't make much sense, it's tonally chaotic, and as with the previous film, the action is fleetfully enjoyable but entirely forgettable.Still, a reasonable amount of the humor works, it's fun to see the way they play with the multiverse, and there's definitely fun to be had. But I find it perplexing how many people love this movie because to me it's a mess. It should have just stuck with silly all the way through.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","SAMTHEBESTEST","15 December 2021","Spider-Man : No Way Home (2021) -
Movie Review :The first trilogy of Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi, has a special place in everyone's heart. Tobey Maguire's Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers' Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014) and MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which made Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for the Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you love Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the years, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes it in style. But, he is not alone. This is Holland's first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still he is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas Present in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final product. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to forget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of time dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret by me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers' writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments whatsoever. Just one condition, you don't have to look for the logic because you're watching a Marvel/Sony's Superhero film, not Christopher Nolan's Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that intelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops the list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCU's Spider-Man No Way Home. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action, fantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but not the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of many Spidey fans but that's where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial potboiler, that's what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode at the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCU's most exhilarating entertainer post Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no matter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","cruise01","18 December 2021","5 out of 5 stars.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic, big, and one of the best Spider Man films of all time. Literally nothing is holding this film back which the script contains about everything. And director Jon Watts making the best spider man movie ever. Fans and non fans are going to love the film. The story is best to go without any spoilers. There are many surprises that will leave the crowd cheering. Story also goes into an emotional direction and making the film feeling like a conclusion to the trilogy. Characters story arcs coming to an end. While opening up more possibilities to where the direction can go.No Way Home does the third film of concluding the story right unlike Amazing Spider man movie or the original third film where they cram up so many villains and a story that can barely hold it together. No Way Home script managed to balance the story and characters out. This film does have several villains. A lot of returning villains that is a lot of fun surprises and even with a new look. Peter Parker facing each one of them and trying to stop them is awesome. The plot is great. It can try to go in a emotional direction. There is also a fun brief appearance of another character which is cool to see and hoping to see more of them in future mcu films someday.The action sequences are awesome and stylistic. Spider man fight scenes are amazing. The visual effects are brilliant. The cinematography is well done in capturing the action scenes. The music score is different by Michael Giacchino but great. The cast ensemble did a great job. Like I said earlier, the appearances making a return is a lot of fun. For a long run time, the film does feel short and very fast moving which keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The climax battle is epic and exciting. Spider Man facing multiple villains is one of the best action scenes ever. It can be a bit dark. The action scene with Spider Man and Doctor Strange chasing each other through the mirror dimension is stunning.Overall, No Way Home is one of the best Marvel films ever. And one of the best Spider man movies. It is big, epic, and the script and direction had a lot of surprises. I am hoping to see Jon Watts take on another Marvel project.There is a fun mid credit scene that hints for where the direction can go. And a post credit scene that hints of where mcu is going next.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Cirdl3","15 December 2021","I can't, I can't. The whole studio was screaming from the beginning until end of the movie, this movie was so perfect, Epic, Awesome and I can't even describe it. When Andrew was there I was screaming and that was making me shaking until now. The visual, edit, it's so so so good than the other MCU movie this year except Eternals cause their visuals are looks great, like a game. I still can't believe it's look like what fans theory said and fan made I can't.I really enjoyed the movie the credit scenes and everything in this movie, and it was so prefect. When Andrew was saved MJ I was really shocked, shacking, that's was epic, and everybody was like screaming exiting applause and me too HAHAHA. After I watch Spiderman I wanted to wanna cry so bad cause it was so good. I can't stop telling you guys this movie was super good 100/10, 10/10 I really wanna watch it again. And venom part I thought he was going to help or fight the Spiderman, but he gave a venom liquid to the MCU. This movie was one of the saddest MCU movies I feel so sad when aunt may died, and everyone forget about Peter Parker. At the end Peter Parker was made a new suit and the suit it's really looked like the other Spiderman movie or the game which is super wholesome. This is so on fire!!!!!.After I've watch this 3 times and there's some scene that don't make any sense but this movie still so so so good... like when the girl from MIT open her seatbelt and when the car want to fell down, she used the seatbelt.Edit : I've been thinking about this like a month I think no way home VFX it's not that good I mean some of theme it was really look like a fan made edits.In the end Spiderman No Way Home, it such a wholesome Christmas movie and serve fantastic fans services, with great storytelling, visual, acting, and cinematography.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","diegosays","16 December 2021","This film... it's going to be the topic of every conversation for the years to come.Obviously, we all kinda expected what was going to happen in this movie.Yet, we all wanted to see it with our own eyes.And it did happen:
THREE SPIDER-MAN'S! That were brought together in the same universe after Dr. Strange erroneously cast a dangerous spell.(We needed an excuse for this to happen, of course)
My personal review here:
I'll be honest, I never was much of a fan of Holland's Spider-Man. The reason I went to see this film was because my inner child needed to see with his own eyes, the possibility of Tobey and Andrew coming back.And, yes. I cried like a baby the moment I watched the Spider-Man from my childhood meeting the Spider-Man from my adolescence.This was VERY beautiful to watch.For a second I even sobbed.But then... something was left.It felt as if the writers did not know what to do with the three ""Spider-Men"" after putting them all together.After that huge moment, that made us all scream and clap, it didn't take long till the dialogue started to feel dumb, with fan service jokes or even about their own movies as Spider-Man.Like, ""yeah, you are the second one"".The moment I saw Tobey, Andrew and Tom together, I thought:
""Oh my god, this is going to be epic af""
""This will probably be the most important film of our generation"".But, by the end of the third act, I realized:
They did it again...
They took the characters we've loved since we were kids to put them in a millionaire project with a really bad script.Repeating Raimi's mistake. They put so many villains that they didn't know what to do with them, not even with three Spider-Man's.The movie started to feel rushed after that. Causing plot holes, lack of emotions or a good dialogue between each Spider-Man and the enemy from his own universe.(Tobey Maguire sees Norman Osborn ALIVE again and he doesn't say a word to him?)
(Tobey Maguire sees Otto Octavius ALIVE again and they only exchange two words as if they had seen each other at Home Depot)
They gave us a cheapie 20 minute fight where they must ""cure"" every single villain with a magical injection? With barely any good or lasting scenes from each Spider-Man.Not to mention the horrific way Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield just ""vanished"", going back to their respective universes.The movie only lasts two hours and a half. Would it have been so difficult to add 30 more minutes of the three Spider-Man's in action?We barely saw Maguire or Garfield fighting or do anything else before that terrible goodbye.And by the way, what happened to Tobey Maguire? And I'm not talking about his age, I'm talking about how unexpressive and autistic he looks and talks in this movie.Was that scripted?My final words in this review:
Seeing the old Spider-Man's on the big screen again was something too beautiful, but it wasn't ""epic"".But it could have been.It could've been the most glorious movie we ever saw in our lives...
But, the film industry does not focus on good stories nowadays.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","MiroslavKyuranov","15 December 2021","It's...I'm still trying to realize what I've seen, but I've seen things I didn't think I'd ever see on the big screen! We all know that spoilers have been on the internet for more than a year, but apart from the things we thought, there are a lot of other things and of course I won't spoil anything, but...the film pulls very thin string from our emotions and it worked perfectly!The story is solid, it's not just fan service, which was one of my fears, there are explanations for everything. Holland grows in front our eyes with this role and this is one of the many pleasant aspects of the film. Strange's role is important (not a big shock).The villains are...I felt like a kid watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series again...I don't even know where to start. The film has more than a big stake and in some places you stand on the edge of your seat.The action scenes are the best I've ever seen in a Spidey movie and are generally among the best in comicbook movies! There are so many well-coordinated scenes, that after the movie you will want to watch them again and again.There are a lot of dialogues that hit the emotions really hard and that will be quoted long after the movie. In some places you even want the villains to prevail, because it looks so good and you want more and more and more...There are comedic moments of course, most of which well placed, but compared to the previous two films, this one is much darker and more serious. Like I said, Spidey is growing up, and that's tangible. There are a lot of surprises, some smaller, others bigger, but the movie certainly deserves more than one watch with friends. The hall was exploding! (Endgame vibes).Michael Giacchino's music, as always, is remarkable. The classic Spidey soundtrack mixed with some darker elements is a delight for the ears.Open your eyes on four, because there are a lot of references, some more tangible than others, but hardcore fans will be more than happy with what they saw.Knowing that this movie leads straight to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness...you better prepare for the unexpected!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","SnoopyStyle","25 January 2022","It's immediately after the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Spider-Man (Tom Holland) had been framed by Mysterio who also revealed his true identity, Peter Parker. He and his friends, MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon), are hounded by the media, demonized by many, and investigated by the authorities. Frustrated with his situation, he asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to do a spell.This Spider group is a fun group. I love this young group and then there are the veterans. It's a great way to reincorporate the previous Spider-verses and the bonus is getting all these great veteran actors. They are all great at delivering complex characters. There is a bit of redemption for some who ended the previous versions on a down note. This is a good movie by itself as well as a good progression for the MCU.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","sharky_55","23 December 2021","Tobey Maguire's trilogy remains indelible, from its origin story, the pitch-perfect sequel, and the messy conclusion. It has Raimi written all over it, and even at its worst moments, the least you could dub it is memorable. The follow-up series doesn't have that same appeal, but Garfield's charisma shines through, as it similarly does here. Conversely, Holland's rendition has always felt a little cut-and-paste from its surrounding universe, unable to separate itself from the whimsy and bathos of the MCU. This Peter Parker's one-liners are drawn from the same snarky persona as Iron Man, Star-Lord, War Machine, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man...the list goes on. I've made my peace with it. It isn't a new criticism, and could be levelled at most films post-Phase One. But it's always felt limiting in terms of crafting distinct character (and filmic) voices and undermining attempts at sentimentality. Let's start with Cumberbatch's Strange. He's stepping into the mentor role post-Endgame but he's never been given a meaningful opportunity to develop his own philosophy on the character, let alone a voice. Sans his solo film, the premise of the Sorcerer Supreme makes him a convenient plot device to facilitate the adventures of other superheroes. Listen to his dialogue here; it's always delivered at a distance, drenched in cynicism, as if it's afraid of fully buying into the idea of a connection. Cumberbatch seems to be constantly setting up the next punchline, and so even if this abrasive back-and-forth elicits laughs, it never builds to anything genuine, rendering the climatic callback (obvious from a mile away) into a deflated attempt at growth and recognition. Yes, RDJ addressed Holland in the same way, but there was history and a relationship there. There's an inherent self-consciousness to the way that Feige and co. Craft the MCU's humour, so relentlessly wary of losing the audience for more than a second that they keep sincerity at an arm's length. Observe how the entire film just grinds to a halt for the Spidey's stand-up routine atop the Statue of Liberty scaffolding; the trialogue isn't written for the characters, it's written for the fans to play spot the reference (""You're amazing. I want to hear you say it.""). Marvel would never in a million years allow their Spider-Man to be the butt of the joke, or freeze-frame on his goofy smile over 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'. He's too cool for that.This universe's Peter Parker and his defining Spider-Man moment is how he reacts to losing his Uncle Ben, but the crux of its emotional impact rests on what has already been established. What do we really know about this version of Aunt May, anyway? No, not what we surmise and assume based on the previous actions of the mentor archetype, but her as an actual person. How much screentime has Tomei been afforded here and in the first two films that isn't delegated to punchlines about her hotness or her apparent fling with Happy? You need to earn the right to drop that iconic line about responsibility; the words don't hold any weight in and of themselves. What does follow her death works in pushing Peter into newer and darker territory for this Spider-Man, and Holland is finally asked to consider the interiority of his character and how these circumstances might actually damage the psyche of a teenager. After all, what was the complication of Far From Home beyond mopping up the external mess of an Avengers-level threat? Here, Peter must contend with the consequences of his actions (the film initially made me balk at the idea of resetting the universe just so a few teens could get accepted into their college of choice, and then cleverly flips that on its head) and ultimately assume the burden and emotional baggage that comes with being a superhero. The rooftop scene where Maguire and Garfield confess of their own failures and futile quests for vengeance is unlike anything even the MCU is capable of; it's not merely a crossover, but a character speaking across generations to itself, pleading for this Peter to avoid repeating their past mistakes. It leans pretty hard on the audience having that pre-knowledge; you need to know the stories they refer to in order to buy into the emotion, but for those who do, it's genuinely affecting.So Peter completes his mission and manages to do justice to Aunt May's final wish, but what of the 'villains'? The other core theme of the film, beyond Peter's grappling with his grief and the value of revenge, is the idea of second chances being afforded to those who deserve them (who, in Aunt May's world, is everyone). Yet how much of this actually rings true for each member of the Spidey rogues gallery dragged in from the multiverse? Norman and Otto are afforded the most agency as a result of their characters' redemption being more or less pre-ordained. They don't need 'fixing', just a removal of that corruptive influence and a reversion to their original selves. But what of the others? Electro is stripped of his powers and therefore his bloodlust, makes a brief quip referencing Miles Morales, and then is returned to live life as his pre-superpowered, nerdy outcast self. What lesson does he learn? Sandman, as one of the relatively more sympathetic villains of the Spideyverse, was already redeemed at the end of his chapter and never even died at the hands of Spider-Man, so his appearance here is puzzling, reduced once more to an angry CGI spectacle that hits things (Thomas Haden Church receives all of 20 seconds of screentime, with the rest of his stay in sand form). Peter may take responsibility for mistakes made and change himself for good, but how much of this change transfers over to those he impacted? It's a little too neat of a thematic bow to tie all these different arcs together in the name of redemption. The action itself is fine, inoffensive; the climactic battle starts off poorly for the Spideys, before Holland gives a pep talk about teamwork and they then execute a series of pre-planned, carefully choreographed moves in front of a blue screen, only this time it works! There's nothing actually revealed about leadership or teamwork here, but we don't care; we just want that master shot of their superhero landings. It's screensaver material.Legacy is key here: that of this live-action universe across three generations of the webslinger, of the characters within their worlds, and of the films themselves. It's now nigh impossible to engage with this franchise without consuming each and every chapter of its storytelling, an increasingly mammoth task that grows with each phase, miniseries, and cinematic event. You can't just view them as one-offs; you need to buy in and subscribe and devote time to tracking and keeping tabs on its chronology. Your reward is the payoff for this dedication; you know that character, you know the event that they are referencing when it comes up on the big screen. Garfield's Peter is forced to relive the same moment that led to Gwen's death during his rescue of MJ, and fans can recognise the trauma it induces and how significant and moving it is for him to be able to save her this time round. Other fans, however, from the looks of internet reaction videos, seem to be cheering in recognition of this. Is that not emblematic of the two camps of MCU takes in conflict with each other? I'm unsure whether they can or should be conflated. In 2012, when the MCU was still in its infancy, Ebert wrote this of The Avengers: ""It provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable."" I think we do deserve these films. We've supported the franchise from its early rocky beginnings, and we've been there every step of the way in its evolution into a cultural giant. I experienced my own payoff, as millions around the world did, seeing Avengers Endgame almost a decade later as each character stepped out of their portals, the goosebumps on my arm as close to something quantifiable for that feeling of awe and yes, recognition. What lies in future for this franchise, and what is (if there are any plans for, commercial or otherwise) its endgame? I didn't feel anything of that calibre watching No Way Home, but I think it still sticks its landing. Having sacrificed his own relationships to fix the mess that emerged from his faults, Holland returns to where I think Peter Parker truly belongs: in a run-down apartment, landlord berating him for the rent, once again alone with only his suit for company. But there's a reason why the most important scenes are always shot with the mask off. This is where the core and heart of the character resides, and what Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Verse understood so well: the power was never a choice, but accepting the responsibility that comes with it is. Holland's Peter finally makes that choice, and in doing so unveils the human behind the mythos of the superhero. No nanotech or Instant-Kill Mode could ever make up for that.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","drawlife","16 December 2021","Where to begin? I would find it extremely difficult for any Spider-Man fan to dislike this film. What's amazing is the feat that Jon Watts, Kevin Feige, Amy Pascal and others accomplished here.Let me just say the the plot has a lot of mumbo jumbo, comic-book logic that typically most comic fans can get on board with including myself, but because the MCU has built enough trust with everyone, you just kinda go with it. Even if you don't, the magic of all these actors and legacy characters returning for this dazzling spectacle will kinda make you forgive it.Lets also just get this out of the way. It was the worst kept secret that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were appearing alongside Tom Holland. The consensus on this was pretty much acknowledged to almost every fanboy, fangirl and most casual fans too. Also the return of Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, Thomas Haden Church's Sandman and Rhys Ifans' Lizard made it more apparent. It's just a marvel(pun intended) that Sony and Marvel/Disney were able to bring everyone back. Never would I have thought it was possible.The villains are a lot more poignant and prominent than I thought they would be. Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe are THE MVPs of the bunch. Dafoe is used to great effect and is as menacing as I remember him and Molina commands the screen with his presence and delivery. They still feel very much in tune with what Sam Raimi did. Jamie Foxx has a second chance with Electro and it works a lot more now than it did since the last time we saw him in 2014. Unfortunately Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans are the benchwarmers of the villains. BUT, used to some capacity where they don't feel totally left out.Now lets talk about the Spider-Men.TOM HOLLAND: I think Marvel Studios and Sony either had this planned all along or they heard the fans and listened. What I loved about Holland/MCU's iteration is that he is kid who brings his exciting energy and youthful enthusiasm to the Avengers. Also as fan of Spidey comics, particularly the Ultimate Spider-Man series, I feel most of the best stories is when he's a teenager in high school. So I got what I wanted in that regard, however my criticism of his portrayal is that he was basically Iron Man Jr. With a lot of Stark tech. But here, they strip him down, beat him to a pulp, he loses his Aunt May, makes sacrifices and learns from his mistakes. He finally learns and understands with the help of Tobey and Andrew providing their wisdom. I think finally we are going to get the Spider-Man that we hoped he would grow into. It is Holland's best performance as the character by far.ANDREW GARFIELD: Jon Watts and his writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers redeem him. Not that his portrayal was bad, because personally I always found Garfield's Spider-Man the most accurate of the bunch and there are some things to like about the Marc Webb films. Garfield gets the closure he needed as his movies ended abruptly after the 2014 sequel. Every moment he has where he shares his experience with Holland and Maguire on screen is a major highlight. Especially when he talks about Gwen Stacy. He also has a nice moment where he saves Zendaya's MJ, mirroring the fact that he never got to save Gwen. Garfield absolutely crushed it and displayed his amazing acting chops.TOBEY MAGUIRE: For many, including myself Tobey Maguire is the OG. Growing up with his Spider-Man films, words can't really describe the emotions I felt seeing him back. I was practically reliving my childhood the minute he appeared. It was all coming back to me, being on the hype train during his era of films and just obsessing over the Sam Raimi films, it just brought me back. I truly felt like a kid again. Tobey's presence in the film feels very much like the older brother of the group and he bounces off Holland and Garfield seamlessly. It's been a hot minute seeing Tobey on the big screen since PAWN SACRIFICE(good movie by the way) and he hasn't lost a step.Once Garfield and Maguire appear, all three share the limelight as co-leads and not a single one of them feel left out.As for the rest of the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch always commands your attention. I was initially turned off of the idea of having Holland's Spidey have another mentor like figure, but here Strange and Spidey are at odds on how to handle their problem after the botched spell. So that was a nice surprise in the marketing and in the film. Marisa Tomei has way more to do in this film than the previous films and has an emotional send off with her death. Zendaya's MJ has grown on me since FAR FROM HOME and Jacob Batalon's Ned is less annoying here which I appreciated.Piggy backing off that, I did admire that Watts aimed for a more mature tone throughout the film. As I get older I do crave that serious tone a bit more and I savor it every time it is present. I mean yes the standard formulaic humor is still present, but I appreciated every moment where things got serious.I love the MCU and I'm always there to watch their product, but I can be honest and say that at times, they are like comfort food. I know what I'm getting and I know I'll enjoy it. I also haven't been shy of the films I've really disliked, but they have been consistent as a whole. However, when they either take big swings or assemble(pun intended) a film with a more mature tone, every so often we'll get absolute gems like the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy, the first AVENGERS, the first GUARDIANS, and INFINITY WAR. I'm extremely pleased that SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME belongs with those gems. Should Sony and Marvel/Disney keep working together I look forward to more adventures as the Spider-Man I wanted Tom Holland to be. I would also be lying to you if I didn't crave more of Garfield and Maguire. Anything is possible nowadays as we even got a Charlie Cox's Daredevil cameo, which was also heavily speculated and if you've been keeping up with HAWKEYE, you know we're in for a treat.While the story can be cluttered, the film drives it home with the development of Holland's Spider-Man, some excellent performances, and fan service with a purpose. Definitely the best MCU Spider-Man film, one of my favorite MCU entries as a whole, and in the conversation of one of the best Spidey films with Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2 and INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE.9.5/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Thanos_Alfie","17 December 2021","""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is an Action - Fantasy movie and the third movie of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise, in which we follow the story of Spider-Man after ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"". Everybody knows the true identity of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange can help Peter with a spell. Everything change when this spell goes wrong.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an amazing plot, contained plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. Regarding the plot, there were some plot twists that I did not expect so, it was a nice surprise and something that made the movie even more interesting and enjoyable. The direction which was made by Jon Watts was very good and he used wisely both information and characters to create this special movie. The interpretations of Tom Holland who played as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Alfred Molina who played as Dr. Otto Octavius / Doc Ock, Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Doctor Strange and Willem Dafoe who played as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin were simply fantastic and their combination worked very well and created an outstanding result. All in all, I have to say that ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is one of the best Marvel movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","namob-43673","15 December 2021","Updated with spoilers:
This is the spider-man movie to see. This is the love child of the entire MCU. The action is fantastic, everything is great, and there is so many brilliant callbacks and wonderful nostalgia mixed with love, emotions and great acting. For the first 40min or so this is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with Daredevil cameo as the top of the line - and I loved this move, however it has a few errors that lower the score and the longer the movie goes the less I enjoyed it which is kinda strange since the ending is spectacular and Amazing.The CGI is not always on point. Those computer graphic misses stod out was because it is excellent otherwise, so kinda weird with a few misses. I think the Sandman was badly done and The Lizard was a joke. I also seriously dislike Peter decision to try to save everyone and the fight with Strange. That is where the movie almost lost me. And these are clearly evil people, and they died in their respective universe. But okay, the plot does need to happen... The worst thing though is why them? In all the universes, of all the people that know who Peter is, these are the ones coming through? Why not 97 of Uncle Ben's? That would make more sense. My final complaint is that all that comes before comes to Peter is now erased, which is fine and a great hero sacrifice, but it also create issues with continuity and storylines.The great awesomeness is all the rest. The music score is amazing, best since Captain Marvel (which, no matter what you thought of that movie, has the best original score of any superhero movie). And the Flashpoint? Haha.. great stuff. The action is spectacular, the script amazing, all the actors do an fantastic job with Willem Dafoe probably stealing the acting crown. Two end-credit scenes, although I heard some saw a long ""trailer"", which I did not see so felt that was kinda weird, perhaps only in some theatres? The first meh, kinda cool I guess. The second about something I care nothing about with a character I care absolutely nothing about so kinda disappointing to me. I am not going to see Dr Strange II, I really dislike Wanda and I dislike Elizabeth Olsen portrait of her even less. That TV show was the worst I have ever seen, except for Batwoman.. nothing is worse than Batwoman... That Strange movie will suck.Despite my criticism this movie is together with the current running Hawkeye show (which is fantastic) I feel like the MCU is still alive and kicking. And with Daredevil and Kingpin now part of the MCU, can be worse for sure. This movie really take hold of you and give you that magic which the best superhero movies do. I would rank this as the second best Spider-Man movie and top 10 for sure within the MCU. 8/10 and I highly recommend.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Leofwine_draca","16 July 2022","I'm no fan of the SPIDER-MAN films with Tom Holland; I find them way too kiddified and the humour just jars with me. But I can comfortably say that this is the best of the trilogy, and that's because it feels fresher and different to the rest. I loved the recall of old villains, it was great to see Foxx, Molina and Dafoe come back again and it's clear they're having fun. Cumberbatch is good in a limited role too. Best of all are Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who light up the screen and make all of their scenes delightful; they show up Holland, that's for sure. The rest is your usual mish mash of CGI action complete with an excruciatingly overblown and sentimental ending (please!).","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","El-Ak","15 December 2021","I just watched the movie at the theatre and you really don't wanna miss this one out. I will make it simple, the movie will live to your expectations If not exceed them, however, during the first half of the film you won't witness anything new. Every fight scene is in the trailer and I LITREALLY mean every fight scene. But don't get me wrong they were awesome and of course not the whole fight scenes. It's also full of talking and a bit more funny lines than usual. You also have a very very silly plot that was based on some character's opinion and lead to all the events of the film and then comes on of the best plots and entrances near the beginning of the second half that you will ever witness and here comes the second half of the movie and trust me it was beyond awesome. The VFX of this film is breathtaking. Every action sequence is very complicated and loaded with tons of details. The visuals are insaaane. You also have a couple of Spidy suits and most importantly you won't be disappointed with anything you might be expecting. You have Dr. Strange and believe me it was one of the best times you will see him along with another hero cause Benedict is such a great actor. Zendaya role however was meaningless but you know she is Spidy's GF. The Finale of the film is beyond great and feels like a dream come true for all fans around the world that will leave you full of emotions, amazed and shocked! Even the two post credit scenes made everyone yell in the theatre (who yelled for more than half of the movie). Not a perfect movie and a lot of things may not make sense and will make your brain full of questions like Endgame and that's what make a movie a great one. I have now experienced the whole trilogy at the theatre and there is no doubt that this one is the best. I hope you just relax and enjoy it cause as a fan I'd give it a 10/10 easily but a solid 9/10 with love and joy is fair enough.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","lakings97","29 December 2021","Spider-man: No Way Home continues where Far From Home had ended when Spider-man's identity is revealed. In order to reverse his publicity as Peter Park, he enlists the help of Dr. Strange played Benedict Cumberbatch. The spell doesn't work exactly as planned and opens a window into alternative universes that collide all the villains and Spider-Man's together much like Spider-man Into the Spider-verse. William Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church revise their mischievous ways but Holland's version of our friendly neighborhood spider-man uses Stark's technology to help each one from being killed from their own universes. Tom, Zendaya and Jacob bring together the other Spider-man reprised by Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. Marisa Tomei added a level of support, love and emotion to the point that we all cherish. The story showed a unique perspective of Spider-man that we haven't seen in any of the other films. I loved this one, one of my favorite Marvel movies ever, it was filled with empathy, adventure, pure emotional ride. I could watch this one over and over again. Add this one to your library.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","pughspencer","11 August 2022","Not only is this one of the best MCU films, its debatably the best Spider-Man film. It no doubt feels like a love letter to how far the Spider-Man films have come. This film wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for many things like the MCU setting up their own Spidey and Doctor Strange as well as everything that happened in all the previous Spider-Man films. It's fan service but the fan service has purpose to be there. But underneath all the fun callbacks it's still a damn good Spider-Man story. Tom Holland to me is the best live action Spider-Man we've had so far and he's come such a long way. From taking orders from Tony Stark in Civil War to now giving the orders to two other Spider-Men really is an achievement for him. The movie even fixes things many have had problems with. Not just for him but for other things too like how much of William Dafoe's performance as the Green Goblin we missed when he had to wear that helmet in the first Raimi Spider-Man movie. There's so many incredible moments in this movie id never thought id see one day. From Spider-Man defeating Doctor Strange with math to Aunt May's tragic death to watching all three Spider-Men swing together and do science was such a treat. It has almost everything I could want in a Spider-Man flick.The only negative I have for the film is the mid credit scene with Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom. I'm not a fan of those films as I don't like the direction they took this Eddie Brock and Venom. Having him jump to the MCU & than jump back to his own universe was just a waste of time & this whole Marvel Studios having to share the rights with Sony thing is just getting so obnoxious. I really hope they get the full rights back from Sony so these dumb villian spinoff movies can die before it gets even worse.Still it didn't ruin my experience with this highly entertaining flick. It's one of those movies I can watch for hours and never get boredüñ§","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","iamianiman","15 December 2021","NO SPOILERS!Everything that has been previously built has led up to this and tens to hundreds of theories have been speculated and lo and behold, this is so much better than Endgame. Though most of the theories aren't true, but it's impressive to witness the fact that it lives up to all the hype. Sheer madness!Without spoiling anything, No Way Home opens umpteenth of possibilities for new plots and world-building in that the next Spiderman trilogy or Marvel films, anything and everything can happen or exist beyond a shadow of a doubt.Mystical and mysterious, this most anticipated film of the year provides a plot that is rarely seen in the superhero cinematic landscape. It's exciting, refreshing and breaking new grounds insofar that it's unpredictable as it keeps on searching for new angles to entice both the old and new generations.People may get disconnected with the plot because it involves time and magic. However, what's so great about No Way Home is in the friendly tone and weight that they present to the audience, making it easy to understand even coming from someone who is not a huge fan of superhero films.Tom Holland powerfully brings everything here to the table. His range of acting and emotional skills has improved tremendously since the predecessor. Even for someone who despises him, you'll be knocking yourself off your feet in no time!Compared to other origin films that opts for typical storytelling, No Way Home attempts to balance humor, drama and action all in one movie and oh my, how it succeeds at that is just one huge jaw-dropping spectacle.As revealed in the trailer, there are plenty of villains await and everyone has a screentime just or almost as much as the others. No one is in the spotlight too little or too much, resulting in an appropriate amount of sheer greatness to introduce back all the bad guys.There are a lot of jokes to spot in this film. However, some of them offer subtlety and puns that you can see it coming only by the help of your own experience and intelligence. Only when you see the film, you'll understand what I'm saying.Never have I seen such a beautiful but haunting ending before. I don't wanna say much here but the ending alone is a masterpiece that it feels like it's coming from an Oscar-worthy film and I'm not exaggerating even one bit.The one thing I dislike here with No Way Home is its cheesiness during the first half. It projects this parody-like vibe that somehow takes us out of the experience a little bit. Even I get a tingling sense that the cameras are just too lazy to shoot the movie.The 2 post-credits scenes are good and exciting but I feel like it doesn't live the hype to all the existing theories on the web. Good but nothing shocking.Verdict: Within 150 minutes, Spiderman No Way Home offers a rollercoaster ride of a thousand of emotions, similar to Infinity War & Endgame and it is definitely the best Marvel origin stand-alone film to date.","

Now, I know nobody wants spoilers so without going into any detail whatsoever I just want to say, believe the hype because this exceeds it, usually I don't want to get people over excited for something but this has to be watched, it is 20 years of Spider-Man all put into one film that manages to feel like the perfect culmination of all that history, my only criticism is that there couldn't be a Stan Lee cameo because if he had still been with us today he would have loved this.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","eddie_baggins","16 December 2021","THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW!There's not much chance of devoted Spidey/Marvel fans walking away from Jon Watt's and Tom Holland's latest web-slinging adventure without a strong sense of satisfaction from an epic outing, that in many ways feels as grand and risky as when the world first wondered how Marvel would manage to bring The Avengers to life all the way back in 2012.The third trip between director Watt's and his leading man, that sees the groundwork laid before it combine here in a loaded and fan servicing collaboration, to talk about No Way Home without giving away its many narrative treasures and likely iconic pop culture moments is a difficult task but there's reason to believe even early on in its release that this Spider-Man outing will go down as one of, if not the best big screen solo outings for the local neighborhood vigilante yet.As is always the case with such loaded Marvel outings, there are a few narrative conveniences that don't hold up to much examination and a few half-explored ideas but too dwell on these moments would be a waste of ones time when there's so much joy, fun and even unexcepted emotion to be found in Watt's film as Parker and his offsiders find themselves battling a severe multiverse problem that threatens to derail the world as we know it.Filled with an abundance of action set pieces, well-known Marvel comedic beats, more throwbacks and nods to lore than almost any other Marvel film before it and fun character interactions, what is perhaps most surprising of all about this high reaching adventure is the wealth of strong performances found within it from one of the most stacked casts the long running superhero brand has seen yet.From the expected and unexpected cast additions, everyone here brings their A-game with Holland and Zendaya as the loving couple getting great moments together and feeling well and truly like they've both become their respective characters in body and soul, while other returning cast members from both recent and less recent times all appear to care more than just a paycheck collection would suggest giving No Way Home a strong sense of purpose and heart, with the small moments making more of an impact than the films various action oriented segments.Likely to be a film that is explored multiple times and one that is sure to provide hidden moments of joy and satisfaction to those that delve back into it across the ensuing years, No Way Home is another groundbreaking achievement from Marvel who could've easily sat back and enjoyed their success after the events of Endgame but have continued to push the boundaries of blockbuster movie making as they keep looking to provide us with top notch entertainment that is undeniable and unmatched in quality.Final Say -There's no doubt about the fact that Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest and arguably best Spider-Man outing yet. A stunning achievement in pushing forward while also acknowledging the past, things here might not be perfect but there's too much to like here to deny that Marvel has once more raised the bar for the comic book cinematic landscape.4 imprisoned trees out of 5Check out my film blog Jordan and Eddie for more reviews!","

The film is very moving and exciting and the characters are all there so you can't tell them anything. The plot based on healing the baddies and not defeating them is quite original even if it has a meaningless beginning. For the rest this negative film has that the dialogues are disgusting for most of the film and the villains are not managed so well, but it is overcome because in the end the film lives up to expectations and with an exaggeration of fan service.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","cthirlby","15 December 2021","Wow what a ride and such an experience. As a big Spider-Man fan I got a surprising few things from this movie too. First of all they stuck with the villains stories no matter the reception they got on the previous films they stuck with it and that's honestly so respectful. To see not all of them actually be villains because Peter is trying to help them from themselves by not dying was the Spider-Man I have been hoping to see from Tom Holland which I didn't feel in the other movies. Green Goblin is easily the most terrifying how he pretends to be on Peters side and tries to manipulate Peter and May. Lizard wasn't in it much but hey he was still good in the movie. Sandman was awesome, he protected Peter from Electro after the events of Spider-Man 3 and just wanted to be with his daughter. Electro was fun and fresh too with his new look and the visuals. Doc Ock obviously amazing and to hear the call backs to Spider-Man 2, so happy they didn't make him a villain and he actually helped them. Second of all Aunt May being Peters ""Uncle Ben"" was amazing, she delivered the line perfectly and she was just great especially since we had more screen time with her in these movies than we did with Ben in the others. Thirdly Matt Murdock! Are you kidding me! A very small part but wow it's good to see him again looking great and I can't wait to see what they do with that character. Fourthly Andrew and Tobey of course... Andrew coming through that portal and being not quite sure if it was him until he came forward was unreal everyone went mad in the cinema (Same with Tobey) he is still great after years, Tobey amazing too they just hold a special place in a lot of peoples hearts and their interactions with the characters especially Peter (Toms) Just very impactful and maybe they will come back who knows. 5th point is that in the portal coming through we saw Kraven and a Rhino variant and I wanted them to come but who knows... overall they ended the film great with the villains not having to die. Final points I'll say is that Green Goblin vs Peter was pretty brutal, it was intense and Tobey stopping Peter from killing him was just so perfect. My last final point is that ending... Peter having to leave everything behind to keep them safe was the Spider-Man we all know and love. Him getting an apartment struggling to get by and being Spider-Man still with a comic accurate suit and not an iron spider suit. This is the Spider-Man I have wanted and I can't wait to see what they will do. The ending made me think of the game for the PS4/5 and if they go down that route of tone and stuff then this could be some of the best Spider-Man movies coming up. No gadgets, just Spider-Man and Peter Parker being their natural selves and the heroes we all love. Overall this film is something else and I'm glad I was there to see it, it's a good laugh, it's a good thrill and it's Spider-Man. Thank you to everyone who made this film!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","olliechowes","19 December 2021","The anticipation for the movie was second to only Avengers: Endgame. So naturally I was expecting big things, and trust me, it didn't disappoint.I found myself, throughout the film and the days after watching it, trying and failing to pin my thoughts down and give it a score out of 10. This is likely due to the amalgamation of so many previous characters, spanning from 2002-2021 through multiple movies and franchises. This was not a negative, but rather something to be very, very excited about and nervous of how it would be handled. I was scared of a clear villain not being established, however Willem Defoe's Green Goblin was expertly presented as 'the baddie'. Peter is haunted by him after the death of Aunt May, and his iconic, almost Joker-esque laugh gave him a real villainous tone.I can't write a spoilers review without talking about the other Spider-men. The relationship between the three Peter's is everything every Spider-man fan has ever wanted, from their hilarious conversations about web shooters and aliens to their instant connection over the loss of their loved ones. I could not help but laugh at the simplicity yet complication of it all, it's just three different Peter's, yet 20 years in the making. A side note, does this mean that the MCU started in 2002?The basic plot for this film is something new for Spider-man. And while it works very well, it did keep me asking questions about Doctor Strange's abilities. Could he have made everyone forget about the clip that Mysterio made instead of listening to Peter's suggestion? Surely he's smart enough to know that Peter wouldn't want everyone to forget? This line of logic is the main fault with this film. Specifically towards the end when every universe is about to raid Peter's and he suggests to just recast the original spell. Films in which the main character suddenly comes up with some form of solution at the end undermines the entire movie.Tom Holland takes the role of Spider-man in a different way than Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire did. Throughout his first trilogy, he doesn't ""change"" into Spider-man, he essentially stays as Peter even when he's in the suit. This helped bring Peter alive and give us a much more realistic representation of the character. He also doesn't have as much of a problem of balancing lives like Maguire did, or a problem with his Uncle Ben for that matter (Who isn't even mentioned by Holland's Parker after Maguire's Parker explains how he lost him). His adorable geekiness and lovable lightheartedness make this film not only a brilliant Spider-man movie, but a brilliant Peter Parker movie too.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","itisallgoodman","6 March 2022","After the third phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe, the franchise dropped the quality and I don't remember seeing an impressive movie since Phase 4 so far. Spider-Man No Way home became the biggest hype of the year 2021. In the end and I was personally expecting a dissapointment due to the weak performance of MCU in the last time, but No Way Home did way more than I expected. The movie full of nostalgic and emotional scenes. The movie that connects all the generations together and makes a perfect ending to all the three Spider-Man franchises. In the end, this is an another masterpiece from Marvel, with the best fighting scenes I've ever seen in my life, with the best Picture, the best CGI and the best acting so far. I loved The Spider-Men relationships and I have to say that all the three legendary actors (Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield) did a perfect job portraying their Spider-Men.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","sbweightman","18 December 2021","A good all round superhero action film with great special effects and cast of characters. The way it brings together the multiverse does allow for some entertaining surprises, but the lack of a new or single villain as well as the seeming invulnerability of the hero does negatively impact the tension. There's a good amount of humour and drama, but little stands out as truly great in this 'greatest hits' compilation.","

To have this many characters and pull off a project this beautifully is a feat of a whole new level! I especially like the parts where 3 spidermans comes together as a team, Tobey and Andrew becoming the big brothers and providing the much needed guidance to Tom. Tobey even acting as the senior most and guiding Andrew through relationships and the best part Tobey putting himself between Tom and goblin to prevent Tom from running into the path of vengeance. I've seen the movie twice in 12 hours but couldn't shake the emotions I felt for the three of them the first time. The end kinda felt like we're saying our goodbyes to all three of them, which is a massive tear jerker, it also felt Miles Morales, Gwen Stacy will be stepping into the sony universe of spiderman pretty soon.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","garethvk","15 December 2021","Life for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is complicated thanks to his dual life as Spider-Man and the challenges of being in High School. Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"".Taking place where ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.As if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.Desperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.Strange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).Strange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.As more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.What follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.The film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.The film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.While there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.There is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","PedroPires90","15 December 2021","NO SPOILERS - The first act is a mess saved by some familiar faces and one or two funny scenes. However, with the first emotional event of the film, everything changes. First, with a lot of fan service and some weird changes on the tone (I still don't get how MCU wants everybody to move from crying a lot to laughing hard in the next minute), but always growing to a very strong third act on an epic battle (even if slightly confusing).There are problems. The fan service - already mentioned - is simply too much. It's not only what you are thinking. It's remembering all the single moments you can imagine, it's in a lot of dialogue, lots of lines and mostly is there only to tell you ""hey, I'm here, remember?"". But what works mainly as a gimmick supports a very good emotional arc, which happens for the first time on this trilogy. This also helps Holland and Zendaya, who are now better actors and have time to show what they can bring to the table.It's not a perfect film. It's still behind the first two of Maguire but I hope they can keep on this way.PS: The humour is still an issue, but a bit less than on the previous ones.","

Spider man is just another person.The original spider man was so special, he had a sweet grandmother, a girl friend, he went to college , he liked milk and cake , he celebrated Christmas, yet he could cast a web.In this movie he simply is not so common anymore, by giving him too many powers , you disconnect him from humans and associate him with something else.We don't feel that that the guy we meet down the street could be that anonymous spiderman.","

PROBLEM 1:The whole genesis of the problems that Peter Parker faces is a complete betrayal of Dr. Stranges character. There is no way in hell he would gamble with the fate of the universe to cast this spell for Peter. Know matter how bad he wants things to be better for Peter.PROBLEM 2: Now all of a sudden we can cure evil in our villains?! I found this to be ridiculous. Complete incompetence of Peter to just not hit the button and send these villains back to their universe. Way too much of a gamble to just keep all the villains around while he creates some drugs to cure mental illness.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","DeBBss","13 March 2022","Spider-Man: No Way Home had the potential to be great, but everything didn't really mesh together as it should've. Tobey and Maguire's Spider-Mans didn't really feel like the same versions from all those years ago, or at least that's what I feel. And the villains were all meh except for Doc Oc and Green Goblin, but even these villains weren't as great as they were before. Everything feels watered down in my opinion, and the stakes were just not high enough for me to take enough interest.There are some nice nostalgia scenes and good action pieces, but that's pretty much it. The acting feels cheesy most of the time and there's way too much crying, some people may not mind the amount of crying, but they are really trying to exaggerate the emotions.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a decent movie, 5/10 - 6/10; nowhere near an 8.5. It had the concept but not the execution. It all seems more like nostalgia-bait more than anything. It is worth a watch at the end of the day, so I'd give it a recommendation to all the Spider-Man fans.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kuner-59029","16 December 2021","After the animated Spider-Man - Into the Spider-Verse, it was an incredibly smart business move by Sony to attempt something similar with their new Spider-Man movie. And considering the mammoth task of juggling so many characters, the overall storyline isn't bad. This could have easily been a far less focused movie tripping all over itself. However, No Way Home trips over something, that isn't its own fault:
The Tom Holland Spider-Man films and universe are just not very interesting. Tom Holland is an okay actor, but his tenure has suffered by having been shoehorned into the other Marvel films, never having had an origin story or even much in terms of character development or motivation.Does anyone remember how his story even began? Everyone remembers Tobey Maguire's Spidey origin. You kind of remember Andrew Garfield's, even if it was almost the exact same story, just less interesting.Tom Holland is a bit of blank state. He does his wide eyed stare and overexcited fast talking thing, but is given very little to work with. Most of the Marvel movies had him on as comic relief, playing second or third fiddle to their mainstay characters.His own movies likewise got bogged down in ""bathos"" humor, constantly winking at the audience and having characters break character for Family Guy style self-referential humor or ""what is happening?"" moments. They were largely plot driven films instead of character driven like the Sam Raimi films.Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield command the screen whenever they appear in this movie. They slip back into their roles like it was yesterday, and it truly makes me hope that Sony will be brave enough to continue their stories in their respective iterations and universes. Andrew Garfield's films suffered from poor script writing, lame villains and a botched attempt at starting a cinematic universe, but he is extremely charismatic and fun to watch. He almost steals the show here.Willem Dafoe and especially Alfred Molina are fantastic here as well, while Electro and Lizard are unnecessary in an already overpopulated roster. I'm glad they didn't throw Venom in as well (surely they were tempted to).One of the major problems here is that the villains have no relationship to Holland's protagonist, and they have little to no motivation to fight someone they never met. The script demands it though, since these Marvel movies need an action scene ever 20 minutes.The parts where characters are talking are actually a lot more interesting than the fighting scenes, which just grind the narrative to a halt to throw a bunch of noisy CGI crap at the screen. This is especially frustrating at the end, where a giant brawl breaks out for no reason whatsoever right in the middle of the heroes and villains actually negotiating.Zendaya and the comic relief kid are charisma vacuums, with Zendaya failing to act as any kind of emotional anchor to the plot, and the other guy failing to be funny. When they share the screen with the characters from the previous series, it becomes painfully obvious how outclassed they are. Maguire and Dunst shared real on screen chemistry, as did Garfield and Stone.In the end, the best this film has to offer is nostalgia and *hopefully* a path to resurrect the previous Spider-Man film series as Sony does their own thing, separate from the MCU. The MCU is pretty much grasping at straws at this point and burned out much of its audience with six subpar films (Eternals, Shang Chi, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Far from Home and even Endgame, which was a major step down from Infinity War) and who knows how much terrible filler stuff on TV.Sony would do well to pick up where they left off. A 4th Raimi Spiderman with Maguire would be a box office hit.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","dhruvrajraulji","5 April 2022","Ohh man, what a ride. This movie is a dream come true for me. So Spider-man: No Way Home, before I write this let me collect my thoughts. I would say my review might be a lot partial, I have watched this movie 5 times in theatres in every format available. The movie is everything everyone wanted. Jon Watts üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè you really outdid yourself from the prequels. Let's start with the main crew. Tom Holland, I haven't been a big fan of his spider-man since his take felt a bit childish in the previous movies, but I gotta change my opinion now since, man he felt like a real Peter Parker this time. The Peter Parker known to make sacrifices for the greater good, he was perfect, from the initial childish role to maturing by the end of the movie, it felt unreal. Zendaya, she is just perfect, the best MJ - Michelle Jones that is, but his and Tom's chemistry is perfect, they are made for each other and so are their characters. Ned played a perfect supporting role. And the villains, nobody is better than Willem Dafoe. I guess they all redeemed themselves in a way. Especially Electro, ""I thought you were black"". Oh yeah, Dr. Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch, his and Peter's were nothing but amusing.Now moving on to the story. The daredevil cameo was quick in a rather fully loaded movie. The villains came and started wreaking havoc. Peter ""Tom"" got the line that he deserved when Aunt May dies by the hand of the Goblin. That rage that he felt I could relate to the character so much. The way his friends tried to help him, especially MJ. And then the entry of the two Peter's. Andrew was perfect. I loved him, cause I am from the generation who saw him as the Spider-man. He was amazing, just awesome. Whereas Tobey, his presence felt unreal. I never thought I would be so happy seeing him. And the conclusion and the way the Peters worked together that was the best one of the best action sequences ever. The way they made memes real and yes they talked about the webs, you know how it is produced inside Tobeys Peter. I loved how the conclusion came about where Tobey taught Tom's Peter to not cross the line and stay true to his hero name. And finally when Strange reversed the spell, where Peter made the decision of making everyone forget about him, to save his loved ones. The scene in the bakery where Peter decides not to tell MJ who he is and the new suit. The movie is perfect.IF NOT WATCHED YET, WATCH IT, PLEASE WATCH IT.","

I don't mind Marvel films, I don't even mind comics, but I don't obsess over them in the way some people do (and it is fine that they get enjoyment from these films). This review is for people like myself, if you're a fan of Marvel and Spiderman then - simply put - you will love the film.For me, I found I was bored. The running time is long, the story is a little ""meh"" (Spiderman wants to SAVE the villains) and everything is just a little too convenient with plot points coming that are obvious from the get go. In short: It's a cookie-cut film. Marvel has their formula (and clearly it works for them) and they won't stray from that. Sorry, but I am in Ridley Scott's camp. There's no originality anymore.By now you probably already know that other faces do pop up in the film. There are some fun scenes with these characters and I chuckled a couple of times but - the rest of the audience was whooping, cheering and clapping which actually bugged me more as - it meant I missed a lot of dialogue after a character's reveal. Seriously, if you want to chat loudly - stay at home and watch the film instead of forcing others to listen to your inane thoughts.Tom Holland is good as Spiderman and, in this film, he shows a lot of range with his emotion - which was great to see because, until this film, we hadn't really seen that from him but, really, he is the only positive I can think of when it comes to this film. By tomorrow, I would have forgotten most of what I'd just watched.It's average at best. If you're a fan boy, it's the best Marvel film yet.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","quiqueperezsoler","2 June 2022","The MCU Spider-Man has finally arrived. I had to take some time for this experience to sink in and assimilate what it alone has accomplished in a 2h runtime. Well done, Marvel, well done.For those who criticised this movie of having a ""pandering"" fan service or messy plot didn't quite understand the main purpose and theme of the movie. I am not excusing its possible filmmaking-related flaws, but it never set out to be flawless in the first place and I love that about it.This movie wasn't only about pleasing fans but it was also about providing Tom Holland's Spider-Man of the wake up call it so desperately needed. Everyone who criticised the MCU portrayal of Spider-Man has been proven wrong as the character has evolved and matured over the course of the movies to reach the portrayal we all know and love. Far From Home was a step in the right direction from Homecoming, but this one is the pinnacle of it all. I have to give it to screen writters and everyone creatively involved in the movie from a story perspective because they have outdone themselves. This movie, while not exempt of filmmaking flaws and contrivances, has delivered what we never thought we needed. Maybe it's me, maybe I'm blinded by the fact that any and all plot devices used in this movie are of my liking. In a world of magic and sci-fi, political disputes and spionage are rendered a bit underwhelming to me.About the fan service, this is fan service done right, because it services the story. The multiversal backdrop serves primarily for two things: redemption and realisation. I don't want to get into too much spoilers, but certain characters and emotional moments return to redeem characters who need redemption and for others to realise that actions have consequences. Something that we finally see in an MCU Spider-Man movie, something that ever since its comicbook conception in the 1970s has defined and established the character as one of the best in the industry.Like Dave Filoni said about Star Wars: ""It's not really about what we decorate it with (x-wings, lightsabers, aliens) but the familial conflicts, the emotional turmoil that defines Star Wars and sets it apart from the rest"". Spider-man is not what we decorate it with, is not only about the swinging, the villains, the crazy adventures, it's about the human element, it's about how these affect the Man in Spider-Man. I have always been more fascinated with the portions of the comic where we see internal struggle within Peter, when we see him fail, loose, suffer; because it makes the eventual triumph that much more spectacular.This movie single-handedly fixes whatever I saw was wrong with Tom Holland's Spiderman portrayal and elevated him to the stratosphere, leaving him off with a great prospect on what is to come. Not only that, but every character introduced is given enough moments to shine and takeaway something from this major event. Every single character that I wasn't quite sold on (from the principal ones I mean) have found a place to shine and show performances that enhances the movie, particularly Zendaya, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina.It's one of the most daring MCU plots yet and it also manages to please all the cinematic Spider-Man fans at the same time. Whatever movie flaw it might have I have overlooked them as I do the rest of the MCU movies. These are not meant to revolutionise cinema, they are here to entertain, to provide interesting characters and stories and, sometimes even, to elevate and uplift us.IN CONCLUSION, I have no issues with this movie overall. I have some small nitpicks here and there, mostly to do with some of the comedy and side characters. But other than that, it sets out to do what it intended and, believe or not, serves as both conclusion to the MCU Spider-man and also transitioning movie to the stories to come. And I for one can not wait to see what's in store. If you are a Spider-Man fan you will love this movie because it does everything right, if you are a casual MCU fan you will be entertained and amused; and if you are a casual movie fan this movie might be a bit confusing. But then again, these are comicbook stories, I don't know what to tell you.","

Thanks for making me a less lazy person loolOverall I liked it and was satisfied. The movie is filled with fan service and throwbacks to previous movies -- so I highly recommend that you see all the previous movies. It will enhance the experience.And not only that, the movie has its own story and identity. What Tom Holland's Spiderman goes through - it was very satisfying to watch.The ending is the best ending in the MCU trilogy, and probably one of my favorite spiderman endings.The movie took some risks and things will never be the same for spiderman after this movie - and I am excited to see what will come next.There are some moments where the scene / conversation goes too long that it gets kinda frustrating / annoying. The action is nice but not as good as stuff like shang-chi.These are just small nit-picks, the overall experience is still great.*There are Two End-credit scenes, and Both are fantastic.**Willem Dafoe more like Willem DaGoat.","

The story was written for kids and strangely enough, it's teenagers and adults who are loving this movie. The screenplay is not all bad because it managed to bring all the villains and spider-men from the previous versions and comprise them in one movie but the plot is poor and childish.Marisa Tomei as Peter Parker's aunt is laughable, her acting and dialogues are naive, she seems misplaced in the movie. Tom Holland was a good catch for the role of Spider-Man other than that just another superhero boring story.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","malcolmjohnston","16 December 2021","After leaving the cinema it dawned on me what I'd just watched a film that should have been lost through inter studio politics and there greedy hands but what we have is quite possible the zenith of all superheroes movies. I honestly didn't think Avengers:Endgame would ever be equaled as a grand MCU movie but this just puts everything before it in the shade, maybe it's because Spiderman is such a beloved superheroe? Maybe it's the imperious special effects? Maybe it's the supporting cast? Who knows but this is the Spider-Man movie you always wanted
Only thing left to ponder is will Sony and Marvel/Disney see the potential of working together to give the money paying public more of this kind of collaboration or will the dollar signs get in the way.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","isaacsundaralingam","17 December 2021","(No Spoilers)Spiderman: No Way Home is probably the biggest superhero movie since Avengers Endgame... There's no denying that. Ever since this movie's announcement, you knew this was a bigger deal than the usual superhero flicks. And being a movie with such high expectations, means that there's so much room for things to go wrong. And unfortunately... It seems like it did.Now I'm fresh out of the theatre, and I already feel like this movie had so much potential wasted. A sentiment I also share towards Avengers Endgame; where the only thing the writers seemed to worry about was 'fan-service'. Fan service is fine honestly, but the line should be when fan-service slowly starts taking over for storytelling. Because the storytelling in this movie was childish.Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie... I enjoyed the theatre experience... It was fun... But fun is not enough when you realize what could have been. Spiderman: No Way Home could have been Marvel's most ambitious project yet, but it has the curse of Marvel's horrible writing staff who similarly messed up everything from Avengers Endgame, to WandaVision, to Falcon and the Winter Soldier, to Loki and to Black Widow. The plot of the movie sounds like some cheap fan fiction that somehow got made. And what's even worse is its absolutely cringe worthy dialogue; existing for the sole purpose of reminding the audience of previous Spiderman movies. It's such a dumb and convenient plot that just exists for the sake of nostalgia.I loved Avengers Infinity War and I really enjoyed Spiderman Far From Home, but I haven't enjoyed a single Marvel project since, because all their projects have been so shallow with no real substance to back itself up. Marvel has a writing problem that needs to be looked into, for the sake of cinema and storytelling.What a missed opportunity... What an absolutely missed opportunity...","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","lucaslw-93145","19 December 2021","This is it. It's what we've all been waiting for. This is the Infinity War equivalent for the Spider-Man movies, it's the most ambitious cross-over in the history of Spider-Man, and honestly, the most ambitious cross-over since Infinity War.Insane cast, Willem Dafoe brings an Oscar-worthy performance, Tom Holland and Marisa Tomei both bring their dramatic A-game, Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprising their roles with heartfelt intensity, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are incredible antagonists (though as far as villains go, Dafoe steals the show, just as Garfield does for the good guys).Insane fan service. Great intro of Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock in official MCU capacity. Fantastic way to bring back Garfield and Maguire. Great choice of villains, even if the 6th member of the Sinister Six was getting drunk in Mexico. We finally get an official ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". Nice meme material, ""You know, I'm something of a scientist myself"" and ""my back"". The fan service here didn't feel forced.Great action. CGI wasn't the best the MCU has to offer, but absolutely gets the job done. I think as the Dr. Strange's skills as a sorcerer have improved, so too have the creativity of the visuals used to depict his spells. Very fresh feel of the mirror dimension this time around, looking forward to seeing it again in the next Dr. Strange film.Most of all, it's a great story. The character growth is dynamic and well paced. It happens on all facets and it's very clear that the writers and Jon Watts have taken to heart criticism of the first two MCU Spider-Man films. There's the heart-wrenching loss of Aunt May (never gets easier to see any Spider-Man losing someone), a serious stepping up of Tom Holland's Peter Parker to be more than just an Iron Man Jr., and an apologetic reminder that Parker is broke (and not a Stark trust fund kid), both during the movie and once again at the end, when his slate is wiped clean. Garfield gets a chance to save Holland's MJ in a very dramatic mini-""redemption arc"". The best part of the script is the motif that Spider-Man's best attribute is his incredible moral compass, and great moral strength, willing to take on all the pain and sacrifice so that his friends and neighborhood can live on prosperously even if he gets left behind. It's an echo that establishes the Spider-Man at the end of the film as a spiritual successor to Capt. America more strongly than it does as an Iron Man Jr. The growth that Maguire and Garfield's Spider-Men bring in helping Holland's Spider-Man realize that vengeance is not what Aunt May would have wanted, and by extension, is not the Spider-Man way is incredibly touching and a fantastic dynamic for the three Spider-Men. Toby Maguire's goodbye in the movie ""You know. It's what we do"" to Tom Holland is a great send-off and acknowledgement that the mantle of Spider-Man is never an easy one to wear, but it's one that Spider-Men in every universe wear with great power and responsibility.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a tale of sacrifice, growth, and redemption. Say what you will about the quantity of the MCU, but the quality of select films like Spider-Man: No Way Home is undeniable, and I hope this isn't the last time we see an adventure as epic as this was.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","papanloveu","17 December 2021","Honestly fully confident this is best spider-man movie. Found myself subconsciously clapping and just screaming inside with joy. The returns of some characters are incredible. The film balances the comedy with a dark/sad plot to follow. Tom Hollands spider-man in a film so crowded still manages to shine and outdoes himself with his performance. This feels like a true spider-man movie especially in the very last scene. His performance is incredible and some of the action sequences are beautiful with moves taken from the game. This feels like the most badass, realistic and cool portrayal of a spider-man yet. It maintains comic accuracy and tom's suits are beautiful. Some scenes are absolutely heart wrenching, i found myself crying numerous times. This film is a masterpiece and a love letter to all marvel or spiderman fans and a work of art. It avoids the other spider-man movies mistakes and just gives characters such realistic convincing arcs. A true work of art, round of applause for John Watts and Tom Holland.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Horst_In_Translation","20 August 2022","""Spider Man: No Way Home"" (not the best title) is, as you knew already from the title, one of the most recent Marvel movies out there. With the Avengers films over after the Thanos battle, pretty much every character is about to find closure in a way. Oh well, what you saw at the end of the most recent Thor film does not indicate that, but the final sequence with Tom Hardy here is not as much of an introduction to a fourth Spider-Man film, so it will maybe stay at three. The music you heard with the closing credits was also fairly fitting from this perspective. Of course, it is also a great connection to the three Spideys from this film here, but I will get to that a little later. Let's look at the basics first: The director is Jon Watts and he was also in charge of the previous two Spider-Man movies. Same is true for the two writers. It is not a surprise that they got chosen too for this one, but the real surprise was maybe that they got picked for the first film five years ago maybe as they were not really famous. Then again, these Marvel films rarely go for the truly defining filmmakers of our generation, but get in some new blood instead most of the time. Just like this trilogy here. The director worked on several Fatboy Slim music videos in the past and the two writers McKenna and Sommers collaborated on American Dad, which is both pretty cool. As for the cast, you will find a handful names from the previous films, obviously Tom Holland in the lead and also Zendaya who is really cruising right now with her roles here and in Dune. Jacob Batalon looks much more manly in real than in this film where he plays a nerdy character. Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange is really in every Marvel movie these days, which shows how popular he is. Benedict Wong I definitely appreciate here too as always. I like his character a lot, but sadly he does not have a lot of screen time here. Marisa Tomei is also back and she plays the youngest Aunt May you will probably ever come across. Still interesting that she is the only Oscar winner from the original cast here. They brought in another one with an Academy Award, but more about him in a second.The certainly most memorable aspect about this film here is how they used the multiverse idea to include the Spider-Man characters of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire despite how long ago it was for them to portray the character. Well, mostly for Maguire, but it was so cool to see them reprise their roles and the entire idea that they are still Spider-Man and always will be. No matter how much time passes. Of course, I am a little biased here because I adored the Sam Raimi movies back then, at least the first two, and I also quite like Andrew Garfield as an actor. I guess I will always rate these two above Tom Holland who I have disliked for a while, but he has grown a bit on me here admittedly and I will wait with my final judgement until I have checked out his previous two Spider-Man outings. As for the other two, they did not come alone, which adds even more awesomeness. We also get the key antagonists from their movies again. This includes Jamie Foxx, the other Oscar winner I mentioned early on and Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church, even if the latter two did not get featured too much. But Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn were and this was utterly amazing because I love the two characters and also so enjoyed their performances back then and now again in this film. What a blast this was and this is a key reason why I give this film a really enthusiastic recommendation and not just a solid one. I think Doc Ock was the one who we saw first in here in terms of the antagonists they brought back. They all had really cool introductions. Also interesting references about how they do not know about their own deaths, but talk about others' before they realize the gruesome truth. When they were there locked in these chambers, they almost felt like dogs. Dogs that once bit somebody, did something awful, but the protagonist tries to bring them and their hurt souls back and have them live lives as normal human beings without evil taking over.Dr. Strange is not happy about this idea at all and he even follows and fights Spidey over it. He sure could not be kept inside this chamber for long, but spider webs were more effective on one occasion. This role has turned Cumberbatch into an actor who is easier to like for me now after really struggling with him on Sherlock and also on The Power of the Dog very recently, a film that did not impress me one bit. But back to this one here: Strange is of course also the connection to the multiverse once again and with the latter I also keep struggling a bit at times, but here it was alright overall I guess. I remember his comment that they know almost nothing about the multiverse, haven't explored the way it works at all. I second that. Comedy is of course also something you always find in Marvel films and this one here is no exception. Unfortunately, they cannot get in the Stan Lee cameos anymore, but those were never really funny anyway, more like cult. Funny moments here include Strange's reaction when he finds out that Spidey has not even tried to talk to the people from MIT after he and his buddies got rejected. But yeah, I guess saving this woman's life there helped with that then. For me personally, it was very funny when the three Spider-Mans compared their ""web activities"" and certain techniques that the characters had in their films that differed from each other. Like how Maguire's had basically an endless stack of webs and Garfield's character had to literally create his in a lab or something which was exhausting. I guess this was where the superhero aspect already moved a bit aside for science as Garfield's was then a bit more of a Batman approach.What else felt funny? Oh yes, how they encourage each other, especially Garfield's character when they call each other amazing. Like ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". Another charming reference there back to the books and the original title. I could really go on and on here with the moments that will make you smile or maybe even laugh, but I will leave it at that. In any case, the film was also a triumph from this perspective. And I would not say this is a given because I have been critical at times with comedy in Marvel movies and I am referring there a bit to Tony Stark's Iron Man and his sometimes try-hard punchlines and especially to Chris Pratt who has absolutely no comedic talent if his material is not outstandingly good. By the way, Tony Stark is also included briefly in this film here or rather his company I should say. He himself is not for obvious reasons. A few words on Zendaya: I was critical about her too in the past and I still think the way she is overexposed in Hollywood right now does not match her talent as a whole. If we are talking about Spider-Man's romantic interest, I'd probably pick Emma Stone over her, Kirsten Dunst maybe not. Still Zendaya is growing a bit on me as well. I just wish she would go with her full name at some point. That would make it easier to respect her as an actress. Anyway, there was really only one moment here that she had that I did not like, namely when she stands up against Dr. Strange. That was not a strong female moment, but on the cringeworthy side, also how softly Strange reacted to her. He was right really when he said that Holland's Peter Parker is just a boy and that's it. J. Jonah Jameson would definitely agree and it is just a phenomenon how J. K. Simmons keeps portraying the character for decades. Awesome stuff as I adore the actor, but I must still say it is a such a limited character that there was almost nothing to him here this time. Only seeing him early on in his chamber there recording more anti-Spidey propaganda was funny. He surely made him his priority gently-speaking. Or, more accurately, his obsession. So there is a third Oscar winner on board here in fact.As my review is getting closer to an end, I also want to talk a little more about the other Spideys here. They included really great references to their films from years ago that kinda made me want to watch those again at some point in the near future. I mean pretty much their entire inclusion here did. But there were specific moments too and those were not about the comedy like some of the earlier stuff I mentioned, but they were about serious situations. I am referring to Franco's character in these very old films or also how Osborn says he has a job for Parker, just like he liked the character back then and with Garfield's character the most serious moment is of course when he holds Zendaya's character like he held Stone's back then. But Holland's character, the current Spidey, also has his own major loss here. Family affair. The moment was maybe not as touching as I would have liked it to be, so yeah there are negative criticisms for me too with this film for sure, but they are not too major. The good moments are far more frequent. The ending in terms of closure was really nice too with how he runs into certain characters again and we know there is hope for him and with Zendaya's character it is also best if he starts anew and destroys the note he prepared. It's basically as if his universe is a new one as well. Only he remembers what happened. Back to solitude and ready to save the world or at least New York many more times. Look at the cup on the table and what is written on it before he swings out in the end through New York during wintertime. The snow was amazing. At the very end, let me say that you also see Jake Gyllenhaal at the very start in what is a reference back to the second movie from this trilogy. But as I said, the closure to this third film and the entire trilogy could not have been any better. Great job and this makes it very easy to forget some previous mediocrities. Such a creative movie. One of 2021's best. Do not miss out.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Adam-09265","9 June 2022","Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this movie. Although it mainly just looked like a cameo showcase with some connective plot. Even the lines were cameo'd in certain areas to possibly trigger nostalgia more.I sort of liked the story and get what they were trying to do, but it seemed too complicated to be executed with a clean narrative. I don't like how Doctor Strange was down powered by Peter Parker, i know Peter is a smart nerdy kid with powers but it destroyed the whole mystic arts master vibe that we love from Strange. Maybe it's just me that felt that way.Like i said i get the idea but it was too quick of an execution. I guess development would cause the movie to be 5 hours long. It was a little cringy in areas where i noticed plot holes just so they could speed up the story and not give proper explanations. It was just too large of an idea to crush into a 2+ hour movie and make sense.My answer is enjoy the movie through nostalgia and entertainment, don't look for clean story because instead the movie looked like a brag on what Disney can accomplish when making deals with other studios. Using nostalgia as a weapon again, Disney do this all the time.","

Tobey, Andrew & Tom are no longer three different set of movies, they all come to as one adventure, together.Spidey is now reset to a new beginning (no caretaker, no girlfriend, no best friend). This will allow the building of a whole new story.Because Spidey Tom still remembers it all, this closed chapter can't be dismissed or forgotten, it is the building block of what's to come. It's a bittersweet legacy which opens door to bringing back the past if writers want to go that way at a later stage (after all, a spell can be reversed, most times!).I always loved these three actors, seeing them together was a dream come true I could never have dreamt of in the past. And before you know it, it's already the end of the movie, this is how captivating it is. 10/10 for me for sure!","

Of course No Way Home has many surprises that I won't spoil, but don't expect too much on storyline. The plot is pretty simple actually, and the trailer had already shown almost all the plot.

The plot I must say is quite infuriating, they have taken this no killing thing way too far and have decided to make the Tom holland peter a very annoying kid. Perhaps it is because it is the first major film in phase 4, but if they want to create an event to introduce the antagonist in phase 4 at least let it be something cool and not some stupid teenager's stupid mistake. If I were to summarize the film briefly it will be tom"" Peter tried to do good, but caused a lot of harm on the way, and in the end he actually didn't do any good, it also seems he have brought in even more problem.""","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tm-sheehan","16 December 2021","My Review - Spider-Man : No Way Home
My Rating 8/ 10I've never seen a queue like this one at our local regional Blue Mountains Cinema so it looks like this new Spider-Man movie will be a Box Office bonanza . It certainly needs to be as the estimated Production Budget was an obscene $200 million USDollars .I rated the previous Spider-Man: Far From Home a very respectable 8/10 as I enjoyed it immensely.This movie is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and is the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) takes place directly after the events of Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019). Meaning that it takes place in the Spring/Fall of 2024.With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help. When a spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear, forcing Peter to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.The ingredient I enjoy most in this Marvel franchise and there's a lot of comic book humour in Spider-Man or as I think this one should really be titled Spider-Men. No spoilers but I enjoyed the second half of this long movie more than the first especially when Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire form the formidable trio of Arachnids.It's amazing to me where original quotes from Spider-Man show up and are used by other cultural iconic personalities I didn't realise that Ru Paul's often used quote ""With great power comes great responsibility, which Queen üëë have you chosen to get the CHOPPED? Is a proverb popularized by the Spider-Man comic books written by Stan Lee and published by Marvel Comics
Of course the CGI effects are the best State of the Art but I think it's the great ensemble cast that makes these films so entertaining including the Actor of the moment Benedict Cumberbatch as the Wizard Dr Stange . I particularly enjoyed Zendayer as Peter Parker's girlfriend she has some great moments with Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and she's delightfully natural.Tom Holland helped to save this movie from cancellation by forcing renegotiations between Sony and Disney. Under the terms of the new deal, not only does Spider-Man: No Way Home still take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but Spider-man can also appear in future MCU movies, as well as Sony's own Spider-Man franchise.If Sci Fi Action is your favourite movie genre you'll probably rate this latest Marvel movie higher than my quite high 8/10 Rating but I thought it a bit dull in parts and a tad too long 20minutes longer than Spider-Man : Far from Home which I enjoyed more and that movie only cost a mere $140 million estimated budget to make.Great Escapism Movie - Well done.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","liamgg-26681","6 June 2022","While No Way Home never reached the heights of some of the MCU's best for me, the film is still an incredible achievement that carefully juggles decades of Spider-Man storytelling to craft a satisfying adventure that takes you through many different emotions. The third act's big surprises might overshadow some of the movie's flaws, but the handling of fan service is done to perfection without feeling forced. A great ending to one of my favorite superhero movie trilogies of all time.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","The_Dog_Father","23 July 2022","I couldn't find one thing to like about it.Such a climatic ending and cliff hanger for Spider-Man Far From Home, and this starts out flat as an opened, left in the car for a week, diet no caffeine coke.I was in shock how pathetically written the movie started out, doing an ""okay, all is forgotten, you kids can get on with your life now."" Sloppy, lazy, and insulting, even to the youngest of fans out there.Like a date promised to go to a nice restaurant, and they end up getting treated to that one hot dog at the gas station that has been on the back rotisserie for a day and half.As we get over the first absurd shock, the movie just keeps getting worse and worse, more ridiculous as the plot unfolds. Recycled parts, with a really bad appearance with Dr. Strange in it. Their tango together and how that was written is even more absurd than the story line itself. This obsession to defy rules without maturity, by this 3rd Spider-Man, was just too annoying to even come close to liking it. It must be part of the mental issues with kids out there now, ""I can fix it, and save the bad guys.""So very anti-climatic from leaving off from ""Far From Home."" Stale, horrible plot, worst script, and so very dull. I wonder if Samuel L. Jackson saw the original script, and was ""Ahhh hellNaw, I ain't doing this sh t.""For the love of Christmas and all that is Holly and Jolly, get someone who can write, produce, and direct these movies. Let the fans have a go at, or the film students who would do it for room and food truck. They couldn't do any worse, I promise.","

However, I excepted a bit more in this as the ratings seems really high. But, all my expectations fall flat. I donno why they tried to present Spider-man as a messy one! Most stupidest thing is why would he tries to snach the box from doctor strange? For saving these dangerous criminals??","

This film was fun and surprising and I'm glad to see this in opening night.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","ZeroMasterX618","4 January 2022","Yes, it doesn't make sense to only bring 2 spider-men from another 2 universes and villains that also were in those 2 movies, but Marvel here just tried to revive the past, remind us with Toby who we were raised by him. Andrew who's just amazing. And Tom who's Tony Stark's trainee. I loved every detail in it, I liked how Toby is still decent, polite, He's just our spider man who raised us to do what's right no matter what's the cost. And you always have a 2nd chance to be good. On other hand, Tom taught us that with great powers comes great responsibility, and we should never seek revenge and do the right thing. I love all of them and I hope to see TASM3 soon as Andrew really deserves it. And when I say the best I've ever seen, It's really the best I've ever seen. Hopefully Dr. MOM top this movie.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","bloodworia","5 February 2022","Marvel fans are just like Star Wars fans. It's not surprising that both are owned by Disney and it really shows. ""He did the thing"", ""It's the guy"", ""Wow they did the joke"". It's just so bland and Disney is just mainstreaming everything to be some bland cash in on nostalgia. Every now and then you can see an interesting concept or a good scene shine through but more often than not, it is ruined right away by some stupid joke or switch to a funny scene. There is no character no soul left in these corporate franchises.Content like this doesn't matter, it is just like another Fifa or Madden game every year. They dont care about actually creating something worthwhile.What doesn my opinion matter anyways. For every one of my opinion there are houndreds of thousands of people who have no expectations.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Eiriksterminator","15 March 2022","While I have several Marvel and DC superhero movies that I like, I also have many that I do not like, and I'm not that easily impressed. For example, I honestly found the previous Spiderman movie to be mostly pretty boring. But this one...this is amazing! The way both of the previous Spidermen, as well as pretty much all the major villains, from the old movies, all feature in this (they don't just make cameos, they are actively part of the story!), and are ALL played by the original actors, is just so incredibly awesome! They even throw in Daredevil and Venom cameos! Then add on the fact that they actually try to SAVE all the villains rather than kill them...It's just fantastic...If you're a Spiderman fan, or a superhero fan, this is a mut-watch, and if you're not, you should see it anyway!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","impendingdd","4 June 2022","Villains were standing around most of the movie. Tobey was hugely wasted. Makes no sense whatsoever how he doesn't even acknowledge that the man he watched Die (Norman Osbourne) and btw his dead best friend's dad, is living before him in the flesh. No shock, no emotion. Even just for a small moment. Didn't need to take away Tom's shine at all. The director or Marvel says, hey let's give him a moment with Doc Ock! It's just really mind boggling how they go out of their way to be mediocre. This movie is just as bad as the other films of the trilogy. It's boring. It's depressing. Peter in this movie is very annoying and unbelievably naive, even for what most people will say is excusable because he's ""just a kid."" No one cared enough for this Aunt May to die as much as we would have cared for the Aunt May from Tobeys universe because we felt their connection. Lets be honest the relationship with Happy was weird. Happy crossed a major boundary slamming Peter's aunt. Totally uncomfortable. If anyone thinks I should be grateful because at least we see all three generations of Spidey on screen, I don't understand the logic. If I get free ice cream and it tastes like dog turd I'm not gonna be thrilled and say ""hey at least it's free ice cream!"" Im allowed to say what I dislike. Stop settling for mediocrity when better films have been made.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tarynabryant","17 December 2021","As a huge Doctor Strange fan who is more than ready for more of the multiverse, I had very high expectations for No Way Home. Unfortunately, it was a let down. Sure it caters to fans with some nostalgic moments, but relies way way way too much on the fan service while lacking in pretty much all other areas. The story was all over the place, pacing was very wishy-washy, and the writing was horrendous for the most part. It felt very childish and cheap at a lot of moments with jokes that just did not land at all and some super corny dialogue. My best friend and I were genuinely confused at the amount of laughs, cheers, and claps from our audience in the theater tonight (and we are both very big Marvel fans, my best friend being a long-time, devoted spidey fan). So believe me when I tell you that we really wanted to love this movie. Honestly our favorite part of the entire film was the post-credits features. If anything, this movie only further solidified my belief that Tom Holland is the weakest of the Spider-Mans. Not necessarily his fault, but rather the fault of the writers for trying way too hard to make him a quirky, shy, stuttery, awkward teenager and not giving him any real development or depth to his character aside from maybe the two seconds after May's death and his fight with Osborn where we see a glimpse of a dark side in him, but that's it. Additionally, killing off May was just so lame. It reeked of ""we need to kill off a character for some kind of shock value but not anyone too important"". Another moment that I don't understand is when Toby is seemingly fatally injured in a sudden and surprising moment towards the end of the film, but then is all of a sudden okay a few minutes later? There were just too many moments that felt like it was relying on audience reactions and surprise in order to come across as a good movie. I think the main reason it is receiving such praise right now is because of the current hype around Andrew and Toby reprising their roles (which was great fun don't get me wrong), but in the long run didn't feel like it served much of a purpose to the actual story beyond wanting to drop a bombshell on fans. By the fifth conversation/conflict about how Peter can ""cure"" the villains and save the world, the entire movie became a jumbled and chaotic mess. Interesting concept but executed poorly.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mattflohr","21 February 2022","Tom Holland's third featuring entry as the titular web-slinger is a masterpiece. The character development is poignant and heartfelt. The love for the source material is in every frame. All of the actors are brilliant and nobody phones in anything. This could so easily have felt like nostalgia bait but it's so much more than that. Willem Dafoe's performance alone is worth the price of admission. He is unbelievably good in this movie. Andrew Garfield is perfect. Tobey Maguire is perfect. Tom Holland has always been great and this is his best performance. Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are perfect. Cimenatography stunning. Script is once in a lifetime. They do so much in this movie and they pull off all of it. Comedy beats are wonderful and often ingenious. Drama is heartwrenching and believable. Instantly relatable. We don't deserve a movie this good. This movie didn't have to be this good. But it is and I love it.Does it have any faults? The story doesn't make a lick of sense, but that's okay. The actors sell it.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jaysanchu07","14 March 2022","A certified crowd pleaser, No Way Home had me grinning from ear to ear with my finger pointed at the screen far too often. It is definitely my favorite of the Tom Holland films, and a shade under Spiderman 2 as the best one yet. To see Alfred Molina, William Dafoe and Jamie Foxx reprising their roles, was INSANE. Each of their entrances caused goosebumps and their acting, pure nostalgia! Props to Dafoe! His voice and facial expressions remains perfect for the Goblin 20 years later. Really, the reality where we see these characters together is unthinkable, yet here we have it, and the film ensures its more than fan service! Spiderman, choosing to 'cure' gives these characters a shot at the main theme of the film, redemption. This brings us to the grandest (& most spoiled) reveal in recent years, the appearance of the other Spidermen! It is difficult to comprehend and put into words the feeling of seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield suit up. Filmmakers even graces its fans by showing PLENTY of these Parkers as they play huge roles in the third act, complimenting the emotional themes of the film. In fact, my favorite redemption story arch was that of Andrew's. I was blown away by how invested he was. When he caught Zendaya's MJ, his outpour of raw emotions sent shivers down my spine. It was gratifying to see the filmmakers give him justice. Another positive is we finally have a mature version of Tom Holland's Spidey. We see his mistakes and struggles to confront its consequences, themes of a grounded and relatable superhero we love and admire.All positives mentioned, the film does have shortcomings in its plot. There were moments I feel unnecessary like Aunt May's demise, Sandman's motivation and everything Ned. The premise that 'too many requests' during the spell casting ushered the multiverse crisis had a weak hold on me, and to blame it on Spiderman was a head scratcher. The film does however, a tremendous job of giving us things to love to overcome these holes. The sheer volume of iconic characters is a remarkable feat no one thought possible.Spiderman: No Way Home is then, a well packaged present as it delivers what both hardcore and casual fans want and desire. And for that, I give a score of 8.5/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mr_sharma","15 December 2021","As I've said in some of my past reviews, some people only know two ratings, either a 1 or a 10.When every review, I see, is putting out a 10/10, perhaps one should step back and get some perspective. This isn't The Godfather!If you've enjoyed Holland's other outings, you will enjoy this.The trailer gives you clues as to what to expect AND I would strongly suggest you watch all previous Spider-Man films (the Sam Raimi versions and the ""amazing Spider-Man"" versions).It'll help.First of, the film is certainly fun and funny. Lot's of jokes and in jokes.There is some lag though. There is whole 10 minute scene in Happy's apartment that plods a little but then we're back to it.I think of all the previous Spider-Man relationships, Hollands and Zendya's is the most believable (well that may well be as they are a couple in real life).The film is sort of like a sweet nostalgia trip.There are a few questions, we as the audience needed answering and which are even asked in the film, but the answers are never given. Despite that, it does a very good job of resolving a lot and putting to bed a number of issues from past films.I have said nothing of the plot nor do I intend to.The reason you are reading this review is either you want to understand why I didn't give it a 10/10 and therefore why am I not fanboying over it or you genuinely want to know whether it's worth seeing in the cinema.The answer to the first question is that it's a very good film but it won't make my top 10 of all time. There is a lot thrown at this and a lot of it sticks but some of it doesn't quite hit the mark.The answer to the second question is well it depends on the cinema.My advise is that you go see it a big screen, good seating, social distanced cinema. You want that cinematic experience.I went to an multiplex with people sitting next to each other in a reasonably packed theatre with a screen which, frankly by today's standard, was bog standard to small (which surprised me considering the calibre of film being shown),So yeah, go see it (especially if you've seen all the previous ones) but on a grand big old screen cinema with comfortable seating.Enjoy.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","AdrenalinDragon","15 December 2021","One of the best Spider-Man movies ever. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fanservice galore fest done extremely well with jokes, emotion, and heart added to the mix. Not only giving closure to so much of Spider-Man's character, but also for the fans who always wondered how certain things would play out if they happened. This is a movie you need to witness.Picking up right off from Spider-Man: Far from Home, the film gets straight into action with dealing on consequences and trying to amend outcomes. In some ways similar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film stays interesting from scene after scene and never misses a beat. Solid action set pieces and character interactions give the film a lot of fun things to work with, and by the end everyone was clapping and cheering.Without spoilers, No Way Home will please most people who are familiar with all the previous Spider-Man films. I got a little emotional and attached when certain characters popped up again and I definitely didn't feel the movie was a quick-in cashgrab at all. The performances were all really good, the special effects were top notch, and some of the music will be familiar to the fans.In the end, it proves Marvel can still pull off a really entertaining yet rewarding movie for Spider-Man fans. Some minor criticisms I have is there are a few contrivances and maybe some characters could have gotten a bit more screentime, but in the end I had such a blast with what the movie set out to do. No Way Home will probably be my favourite film of 2021. Try to go without spoilers though, it will be more satisfying.8.5/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","siderite","15 March 2022","This film was entertaining enough. I liked the acting, the little gems, the sheer hubris of the story. However, it was for all intents and purposes, a universe consolidation move (before they break it all again in Multiverse of Madness). It's one of those reset stories, but one that manages to unite previous resets, which makes it the resettiest of them all. It is there to basically answer all the comic geek questions about how could so many films and reboots and stories exist in the same MCU and open the door to the future.There were no real new characters, some were explained away, some where killed off and new concepts of the incoming threats hinted at. One end-credits scene winked towards a Venom recrossing, while the second was basically a trailer for the next Doctor Strange film, not a ""scene"".So there is a difference between the typical Marvel cinematic universe film and this one: the villain(s) are weak and unfocused while the plot, however entertaining, just a background to the goal of the film: to stabilize the canon and prepare for the new Doctor Strange movie. This does mean the Strangeverse will grow and possibly be amazingly fun, but also that I don't see the Avengers going anywhere for a long while, except maybe TV series.In conclusion: for the fans of the Marvel stories and the faithful viewers of movies and series in that universe, this is a big nice bonus, a step on a promising ladder of new content. However as a standalone film it has limited value. It is a good film, and probably a necessary one, but its storytelling will not blow your mind in any way.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tareqzaghal","3 September 2023","No Way Home is like a fever dream. It's the type of film that would be made up by fans on YouTube using fake fan trailers or discussions on Reddit. It's a film that truly feels like a pop culture phenomenon, something that cannot be replicated, and an experience people will yearn to have been part of in the cinema in years to come.To critique such a film would be a waste of any viewer's time, you would be missing out on enjoying the entertainment present here, which is amplified a hundred times if you are a fan of all these different incarnations. Corny jokes, flat dialogue and line delivery, some rushed CGI, and lots of instants where things have to happen without making sense in order for the plot to move forward, yes all of that is abundantly present here. If that is to your disliking, that's fair.But it's just a lot of fun, incredibly entertaining and rewatchable, and weirdly comforting. This is undoubtedly Watt's best direction in his trilogy, the entirety of the curing sequence at the flat is beautifully executed, especially the action scenes. The last hour specifically is really tight. It stands out amongst the other Holland films as the one that is best acted, shot, choreographed, structured, and overall most entertaining.Dafoe is devastatingly good as Osborn, a role that might never be done better. Doc Ock is great. Foxx is mostly annoying but provides some good comedic relief. The Lizard is just weird. Sandman is just there. Tobey's return feels rightfully tender. Andrew is still the best one, and the most underrated. Yet, it's impressive that Holland remains at the centre of all the immense nostalgia-bait and fan service, and carries the film on his shoulders, his best performance so far.I hope the next instalment really focuses on a grounded Peter Parker, away from all the Avengers level-threats and multiverse conundrums. Street-level. NYC. Manhattan. College. Daily Bugle. Oscorp. Give me the good stuff pleaaaaase Feige.The MCU can end here, unless they can pull off the Fantastic Four.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","MoistMovies","16 December 2021","I'm not sure this would have been the same type of film if it was total marvel control...But thankfully we got something special. I was not a endgame.. and none of of the other marvel films or series since.. Shang Chi is probably the best before this film, and that one sits in the lower tier of great marvel films ever made... This one is up there right next to infinity war, the first iron man and other great marvel films..
I wish Stan Lee was here to see this film. He would have loved it.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","unununbelievabledeals","7 June 2023","I like spider-man films but honestly this one was too lame already. Lazy writing with weak character motivations (esp Sandman and lizard) and major loopholes in the story. Inconsistent personality from doctor strange and Tom holland Peter.I watched the extended cut. Felt bored a halfway through the film when Tom holland Peter was gonna send the villains back, and didn't feel for any character throughout the film, esp Tom holland Peter he's so stupid in the film.This film is just a bunch of stupid mistakes filled with loopholes just to get the to ""epic climax shot"" of the 3 peters and 5 villains fighting jumping slo-mo to battle each other.Honestly just a fan service film. LOVED Spider-Man homecoming which had good character motivation, plot twists and action sequences.This one even the action was flat. Disappointed and glad I didn't watch it in cinemas.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","fernandoschiavi","19 June 2022","After months of rumors, theories and speculation, there was a certain fear that expectations around the film had become so high that it would be impossible to meet them. However, this third Spider-Man solo film within the MCU delivers exactly what fans expected and wanted, nothing less and nothing more. The film brilliantly resolves all the criticisms and complaints from most fans; Peter Parker in the MCU was too tight. He wasn't a penniless photographer and student, Aunt May wasn't worried about the bills, there wasn't a J. J. Jameson behind him.Aware of the importance that the Spider-Man has conquered in these almost 20 years, Sony and Marvel Studios have taken the path of nostalgia and made No Return Home a great celebration of this legacy without abandoning the current journey of the Friendly Neighborhood. The biggest proof of this is in the opening minutes of the production, which picks up exactly where Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019) had left off. With the adventurous and almost uncompromising tone characteristic of the two previous films, the story doesn't take long to give the young man a taste of the consequences of being treated as a public enemy by the population. So he turns to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. In the best of intentions, the wizard helps the boy, who ends up disturbing the spell to the point of opening cracks in the much talked about multiverse. This intervention results in the Multiverse being inserted once and for all in the MCU - before, with brushstrokes in Loki, WandaVision and What If...? - And that brings back Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, the Lizard and the Sandman. The reason why the gallery of villains from the different versions of Spider-Man in the movies is gathered is not only commendable, but also a hallmark of Spider-Man and the guiding thread of the entire plot: good for good.Gradually, No Return Home abandons the simplicity that has been Spider-Man's trademark in the MCU and begins to add seriousness in a gradual, but efficient way. More than denying what they did in Homecoming (2017) and Far from Home, screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers promote a more than welcome evolution for the hero and those around him. This also contributes to giving the adventure the epic tone it deserves. This chapter is clearly a coming-of-age plot for today's young Peter Parker from beginning to end. The production delivers numerous factors that lead to the character's growth, providing key moments to make him a leading and somewhat independent hero. While his previous films promise such a question, this is definitely the project that lives up to its evolutionary premise. The film plays in the face of the hero and those who watch that he has to face real and painful consequences, to learn about the responsibilities that come with the mantle he chose to wear to help people and that's exactly what the film addresses: growing up in narrative magnitude and make the character grow in development.Despite the plot seem lost at the beginning, and probably, tiring in very brief moments, and being just an ambitious film that will play with fan service to win over its viewers, everything makes a lot of sense in the journey. This is not a production that wants to please the audience with its huge catalog of characters for nothing. Spider-Man: No Return Home is fun, electrifying and exciting, like a roller coaster full of surprises, and luckily, it delivers great memorable moments. There is a lot to process here, with several characters to assimilate and contain the emotion for what is yet to come, however, there is a very well distributed division to highlight that each figure present is an essential piece to compose this great puzzle that makes clear the extremely well-crafted script by the duo Erik Sommers and Chris McKenna.Knowing the weight of each character involved, whether those who already inhabit this universe, such as Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and the inseparable Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) and MJ (Zendaya), or the villains who return, the text of the duo of screenwriters finds space to deal with each one more than satisfactorily. With so many people involved, the story ran the risk of becoming a mess, but this problem was overcome with a balance rarely seen in Marvel productions.The script strives to give moments to each of these characters and the direction of Jon Watts takes the cue to translate that into memorable moments. Full of reverence for what Sam Raimi and Marc Webb did in the pre-MCU Spider-Man films, the director does his best work in front of the hero by stepping out of his comfort zone and taking advantage of the possibilities created by the presence of so many iconic characters. The action scenes are full of energy and really exciting. With text that quickly ties who the visitors from other universes are to potential viewers who haven't seen Spider-Man's previous adventures on the big screen, No Return Home has a clear path to give them space to shine. With a function as simple as it is functional in the plot, they dominate the stage and enjoy every minute - with dialogue that works almost like inside jokes with fans that bring nostalgia without sounding gratuitous.Not by chance, the script is full of situations to catch the audience by the heart. It's nostalgic to see Maguire talking about his MJ or even the brotherly look he gives Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) when they meet again, just as the way the story presents Garfield's Peter as this someone bitter for having been unable to save Gwen Stacy - and makes for a great redemptive moment for that. It's impossible not to vibrate with each of these references to the point where you want more movies for each of them. PFor this reason, it is easy to overlook some inconsistencies or things poorly explained. It doesn't matter why Electro (Jamie Foxx) has become so much more villainous than he was in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or even the swings the Lizard (Rhys Ifans) and Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) have in their motivations. All of this is easily overlooked in favor of the fun that this great party offers. This makes Homecoming like a big comic book come to life. In a story like this, you don't expect a big epic or anything like that, but a fun adventure that excites and leaves you excited at the end. And the new Spider-Man is all of that, even in the little things - from the appearance of Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) to the famous phrase ""With great power comes great responsibility"". The film delivers everything you expect.The classic Marvel formula humor is properly placed in the plot, working properly between these, highlighting the incredible return of Doctor Octopus by Alfred Molina, and the great and fun comic relief of the film, Jacob Batalon, playing Ned, best friend of Peter. And in addition to not having gained as much prominence in the two previous Spider-Man films, Zendaya finally earns her space, as well as becoming a beautiful and significant part of Parker's essence.Already the performance of Tom Holland is a major factor for everything to be even more fun and make the process interesting. He proves that he's not just a young man brimming with Spidey humor with no real problems. There's a sense of connection through every screen moment through his brilliant performance, underscoring that he's worthy of taking on the Peter Parker mantle for pop culture. Holland's growth is visible and rewarding, and is consecrated as his best performance to date in the MCU.The villains work very well together, however, there is no way to put aside and highlight Willem Dafoe's unique performance as the Green Goblin. The villain who marked a generation in the first Spider-Man movie starring Tobey Maguire shows in every way how timeless his relationship with the role is, even taking for himself, breathtaking action scenes. It's also visible how Jamie Fox grew up with Electro, gracing every screen moment he was present.Aware of the responsibility at hand, No Way Home comes to an end as a comic book adaptation that is not afraid to embrace more fanciful aspects. And he does it with pride, because he abandons the worry of looking cool or modern. It is curious that Marvel Studios, which usually fills its productions with clues to the future, has decided to look back on the Spider-Man case. After putting Peter Parker under the wing of several figures in its universe, the studio seems to finally have the courage to emancipate him, and it does so by celebrating a story built over nine films, dozens of cartoons and thousands of magazines.","

Brilliant action with outstanding CGI given they had a year maybe less.3. May's death is a beautiful scene left for as long as it should have and Tom Holland is brilliant.4. Every character from the multiverse felt like themselves and Andrew's performance solidified his Peter as the most comic accurate.5. Even though it is a multiverse movie (which can get confusing) you still understand everything and it all makes sense.6. This is Tom Holland's film even with the two Spider-Men, they still make sure he is the main focus.7. The grief Peter goes through is perfectly pictured and Andrew's Peter described that he had that feeling after Gwen's death.Overall the best Spider-Man film and best MCU film to date.","

Seeing all these familiar faces was great and being there to witness it among fellow fans is unforgettable. The pure joy I felt seeing Andrew then Tobey is unmatched. Oh and the fact they killed Aunt May?! I can't believe they had the guts to do that. Poor Peter has lost everyone he's ever loved. And that ending! I have so many questions about what happens next for him. How do you live when nobody knows you exist? Movie was just fantastic. Perfect fan-service, nostalgic, heartbreaking, intense, and hilarious. Everyone was perfectly presented and got the necessary screen time (which endgame failed to properly do). I hope to never forget tonight and the way this made me feel. Thank you Marvel and Sony for redeeming Andrew's Spider-Man and bringing together the holy trinity. I still can't believe they did it.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","rockdude-68045","15 February 2022","In summary this movie was well received and for good reason because it's a solid good movie. With that being said it wasn't great and it wasn't the best spiderman movie. It heavily relied on nostalgia to carry the plot and development and while I can appreciate it all it didn't exactly climax as I was hoping for. Felt like the marvel series as of late just compiled into a movie instead of episodes.Tom holland uses up the last of his awkward teen spiderman attitude in a overdue effort for his character to finally start truly evolving. Yet it comes pretty slow over the course of this film. Additionally, the main conflicts in this movie basically are all spidermans faults when you really think about it which makes it even less of a plot arch due to the circular reasoning behind the movie.Nostalgically it carries the film for obvious reasons and while I loved what happens I feel like it wasn't as wholesome as I expected it to be.. I guess I just got a high expectation from all the great feedback of the film.There were some glaring issues with the plots reasoning and motivations but I get it. Overlooking some of those things it felt like this film was just a filler marvel movie to set up for the next phase and it showed up in its quality. Felt more like a movie special for tom holland instead of a side series that marvel did for loki, wandavision, wintersoldier, and hawkeye. Basically the same quality and effort except instead of a series you got a movie with nostalgia.It was still a solid film to watch but not exactly top tier from marvel. Still loved the nostalgic parts though! They might have carried this movie but it worked!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","slowcando","3 January 2024","No spoilers or plot-summary here. If you're a fan of all the Spider-Man movies of the last 20 years then stop reading reviews and go see! Otherwise...While Endgame was also a fan-service movie, the premise was acceptable, stakes felt tense, the characters acted 'in-character' and the whole production was pulled off very smoothly.No Way Home is similar in fan-service only, everything else doesn't match Endgame's quality:the premise is so blatantly contrived by Doctor Strange's out-of-character irresponsible illogical behaviour that I had trouble the entire movie suspending my disbelief. So much for him being 'the adult in the room'.the stakes never felt particular interesting. It was all a bit 'so what?'.Tom Holland's battered fish-out-of-water shtick is getting old. By the third movie the hero should be quite emotionally grown already.the attempted redemption of the villains only cheapens them as characters. If they have no agency, then they have no 'character'. Endgame had a similar problem when resetting Thanos's motivations but that character still felt like an epic threat, which is what we want from such movies. Otherwise, where is the tension or excitement gonna come from?the plot-resolution was so over-the-top and logically-ridiculous. We obviously accept a lot of nonsense from superhero movies, but they still require a certain quality of internal-logic, otherwise you can literally just make anything up.Overall not a bad film, of course. It was well-made, fairly entertaining despite the flaws. Pacing ok. Good work from the cast. Zendaya decent value again, tho' her character is morphing into the 'crying damsel/emotional sponge' trope. Some fun FX, even if the Mirror Universe was more interesting in the first Strange movie (and Peter Parker's ""it's just geometry"" to get the better of the Master of the Mystic Arts was eye-rollingly poor).From the three Spider-Man films only Homecoming was a really good one. The other two are skippable. No Way Home has a whopping 8.2 rating on here, which I think makes it the highest-rated MCU movie outside of Infinity War/Endgame. So I expect especially Spider-Man fans to love it. But for casuals who are looking for the quality of the best Infinity Saga movies...well, this one may be a disappointment.Personally, I'm almost done with Marvel, just gonna do the second Doctor Strange movie, and finish with Guardians 3. Not gonna bother with any of the series or other movies. The reviews seem middling, and this Multiverse arc isn't that interesting, frankly.","

There are so many existing stories which could be adapted yet they went with this. The popularity of this is depressing. The multiverse is ridiculous. The number of villains were ridiculous, The dialog of the 3 spider-men was rather bad at points. The McGuire Spider-man tells the Garfield Spider-man that he is amazing repeatedly. That was such a call-back to the previous movie titles that it motivated me to take a bathroom break.Since there are going to be multiple movies with multiverse as a key plot device, I am ending my interest in the MCU.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jackransom-69832","15 December 2021","Easily the most anticipated and theorised comic book film since Avengers: Endgame. Spider-Man: No Way Home is set directly after the end of Far From Home. With Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. When the spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear.It was always going to be difficult for this to live up to the myriad of potential expectations that had built up in mine and millions of others heads after the first trailer released back in August. Luckily throughout its duration No Way Home excels at fan pleasing moments and truly giving Peter monumental stakes and potential consequences. However it is undeniably overstuffed and choppy, as well as for me personally a lot of the MCU'isms not always particularly gelling well with the returning villains.I will be keeping the plot details vague, but for those who had expectations and ideas of what the film might be, it probably is pretty much what you expect. The opening act ripple effect of Peter's identity being revealed, with he, MJ and Ned being turned down by colleges and constant harassment sets the stage well and understandably Peter's desperation for Doctor Strange to fix it. From there the rogues gallery pour through and it's up to Peter to stop them.Here is where some of my favourite aspects of the film are, as well as my irritations. It's undeniably great seeing these characters return to the big screen, and throughout the second act it is uniquely executed and delivers some satisfying interactions between the foes (though some of their motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out), as well as time to breathe. However it is once again the abundance of joke attempts and alterations to a couple of the characters that just make some of the interactions feel awkward and cringe inducing.Doc Ock's bridge battle is a standout return and the choreography, sound design and score all intertwine nicely. Holland wasn't lying about this being a darker and more violent entry into the franchise, with the first Goblin brawl being the film's highlight, alongside the jaw-dropping visual spectacle of the mirror dimension duel. The final action set piece is pure spectacle and grin inducingly fun, it's just a shame that yet again it's another CGI heavy sequence set at night, so it's frequently hard to see what's going on at certain points.This is probably Holland's best Spider-Man performance as he really has some emotional heavy lifting to do, as well as keeping the quips and enthusiasm fresh. Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the film. He's still got all of it: the grin, the laugh, the expressions and genuine menace. Molina as well, brilliantly capturing the commanding intelligence and personality of Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx is far better suited in this iteration of Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch adds a layer of bitterness and snark to Strange, yet keeps his core values and dedication to help in check.Spider-Man: No Way Home may just be the film many fans of dreamed of. Unfortunately for me, whilst it still delivered a lot of what I wanted, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. Dafoe & Molina prove once again why Spider-Man 1 & 2 will never be topped, the increased personal stakes for Peter are welcome and I'm still partially in awe that the film actually happened. However the leering presence of now extremely familiar and annoying MCU traits and tropes, certain character interactions and an overstuffed storyline do hold it back.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jackgdemoss","17 December 2021","Spider-Man is fantastic for 2 hours out of it 2.5 hour run-time. The finale certainly dwindles but that isn't the biggest fault. The problem for me was with it's over-abundant fan service and the disingenous marketing surrounding the movie.I don't usually mark spoilers but it feels necessary here. It felt like this was supposed to be the film that got the multiverse started beyond the Loki series, and it truly doesn't. It is an entirely self-contained story. Even the venom tease from venom 2 post credits does not come to fruition, and instead, just passes through to another post credits scene to further tease.The film did have mostly positives across the board which kept it at an 8 for me. In particular, I think this is the best sound design in a Marvel film to date. The punches, terrain shattering, and dialgoue were so crisp and distinct. The sound scape just felt right in every scene and I would love Christopher Nolan to take some notes prior to directing his next thriller.","

I don't want to go in-depth cause there is a lot to unpack in this film. So I will say that this is one of the best Spider-Man adaptations and one of the most important. This movie has an excellent balance of humor and tragedy, heroism and villainy, and the vast characters this film brings. If this rating/review is about portraying the challenges a hero encounters and the actions they must make, and how they portrayed Peter Parker so well, this movie would be a 10/10.

Else, this was a very boring and stretched film. The thing about Maths overpowering superpowers was silly too. All the actors acted very well, but the premise of the film was comical. I liked the spell-scene which showed the limitation of 'spells'. I hope creators show their normal, day-to-day lives too, instead of clubbing multiple characters together. Spiderman has superpowers but is also desperate to enrol into an elite college? Isn't saving lives enough for our wunder-kid?","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","alekspredator87","25 July 2022","In the vast world of the Avengers, the appearance of Spider-Man performed by Tom Holland was greeted very warmly. The young hero is very much loved all over the world, and the successful Infinity Saga, which was just gaining momentum, was replenished with a famous character to please the public. Two solo albums followed, which were well received by the audience. Well, the announcement of the third film about Parker's life and his meeting with heroes from other universes raised interest in the upcoming film to the skies, perfectly playing on the fact that even fans of films with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield will also be interested in the project. The option really turned out to be a win-win, while giving the audience another high-quality story.The plot plot, however, looks kind of ridiculous, implicates Doctor Strange here. The magician and the magician reacts to Peter's request, in my opinion, somehow not in an adult way. But we all understand that if the magician had refused the young Spider, the story would not have happened at all (although everything is difficult here because of other projects, including Loki and Wanda/ Vision). Nevertheless, a certain solution triggers a chain of events that demonstrate a lot of interesting content on the screen.It cannot be said that the film was created exclusively for fans. The story is strong and allows Tom Holland's Peter Parker to grow up, rising to a new level. The dramatic events that meet the audience during the narration necessarily affect the personality of the young Spider, perfectly demonstrating that he will have to answer for any of his decisions on his own. He is no longer a teenager, and the stakes are high, often it's human lives. And if you have decided to act the way you acted, then be ready to answer for the consequences, even if it hurt your heart unbearably.This film shows well who and how of the characters moves further along their storyline. There are a lot of heroes and villains here, whose fate is really interesting to know. Well, the great trinity will definitely make you not only smile, but also worry about the fate of everyone, especially in the finale of the story. Viewers will see a reverent and respectful attitude towards the previous Spider-Man franchises. The presented characters will tell how they lived at a time that we have not been able to see on the screen, they will tell, it seems, everything that is needed to ensure that the audience has a general picture of their worlds.However, do not forget that this is still a film about the current Spider-Man. The picture will be focused on it. Holland has surpassed himself in terms of acting. A young man together with his hero turns from a teenager into a young man who is ready to live as an adult and independent person, having left the custody of older comrades. Finally, you begin to understand that in future tapes he will no longer need mentors, such as Tony Stark, Nick Fury, Happy Hogan or Stephen Strange. And after the end credits, you catch yourself thinking that the trilogy about the guy that happened is just the teenage period of Spider-Man. And the potential of his individual future stories is very great.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" has become a great blockbuster. It has everything you need for a successful movie. The stars have converged. The successful, but recently stalling Marvel cinematic universe has given fans of the past and present a really worthwhile project. The creators have successfully entered into their Fourth phase about the Multiverse a strong project that is directly related to it, and also thanks to an uncomplicated plot gave the world the opportunity to plunge into the past and see the heroes and villains they have loved for a long time, literally breathing new life into long-familiar images. All this made it possible to earn an excellent box office, prepare the ground for future projects about Spider-Man, and, most importantly, reminded and even taught young viewers important things. It is necessary to be responsible for every adult independent decision. Take it on your shoulders, learn from mistakes and understand that every person has them, even if it's Spider-Man.After all, ""the greater the power, the greater the responsibility.""8 out of 10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Squirrel_the_Grip_1","19 December 2021","I highly enjoyed Spider-Man: No Way Home. It was a great culmination of all three properties of the Spider-Man franchise blending Sam Raimi's Spider-Man universe, along with Marc Webb's Spider-Man universe, into the Marvel Cinematic Universe into Marvels famed ""Multiverse"". My only real quarrel with the film was that it spent too much time re-introducing the characters we already knew from previous movies and now timelines. All the character performances were superb and endearing.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","bryangary65","9 February 2023","All a bit daft but harmless funBest part of film was bringing the other two Spider-Men back, which was a clever idea and could only work the one time.Always think the acting talents of Zendaya are wasted in this sort of movie which relays so heavily on special effects, though always good to see Marisa Tomei on a big screen
If you like seeing all the enemies of Spider- Man come together in one film, then you will not be disappointed, but though Tom Holland has been a decent Peter Parker I am not sure where this franchise can go now with regards to making classy sequels and I for one will not be in a hurry to see it.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Aaron1375","26 December 2021","I believe the last film I watched at the theater was that Lion King remake, but before that it was Spider-man Far From Home. I used to go to the movies all the time, but due to the whole pandemic thing I have not gone in a long while and add to that crippling depression making going out for me a very difficult task. That being said, I am a huge Spider-man fan and I have seen all the Spider-man films in the theater so I managed to get out of the house for my off day from work rather than just staying in bed all day. I was rewarded with a very good film, full of action and nostalgia; however, that being said due to my state of mind it also made me severely sad and a bit suicidal. Just hard for me these days to fully enjoy anything with me growing older and life becoming a pointless endeavor. Still, I enjoyed seeing the old villains, especially Dr. Octopus as he is my favorite Spider-man villain from the comics.The story, Mysterio's message at the end of Far From Home has Peter hounded by the press, taken in by agents and ruins his and his friends MJ and Ned's chances of getting into MIT. So Spider-man goes to Dr. Strange's place where he asks if there is anything the good sorcerer can do. Dr. Strange says he can make everyone forget Spidey's identity, but while in the middle of casting, Spider-man keeps adding stipulations causing the spell to go out of control. Soon enemies of Spider-man from the multiverse emerge and Spider-man must round them up so that they can be sent back; however, our hero soon learns that they are going to die and he wishes to help him despite Dr. Strange's protests. Soon Spider-man finds himself in the need of help as things get there darkest and he finds two other allies to help set things on the correct course.The film is good, but it definitely did not help my depression one bit. Watching the scene where MJ was rescued almost had me burst into tears, as I remembered the scene from one of the other films and remembered my fiance who has since passed away was with me during this time. I also felt alone as Peter was and feel a sense of hopelessness as my life has no meaning, so while a good movie, it probably can hurt someone who is struggling with bad depression as I am. I was honestly hoping for a more happy type film to make me feel a bit cheered up more than one that made me go further down...So a great film, one of the better MCU films and my favorite of Tom Holland's Spider-man films. I honestly, though, would love to see Garfield return to the role for maybe another Amazing film as it was good seeing him as Spider-man again and it would be nice to see some closure for his Spider-man. Heck, I would not mind another Tobey one either as that series never did have full closure either! That one is probably less likely due to Tobey's age though. I will say my only real complaint of the film is the lack of a new villain, this being due to the fact Spider-man has a whole gallery of villains so having a new one would have been easy and would have given the film six Spidey foes making them sort of a Sinister Six! That would have been cool, but still an amazing film all the same.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","nsmiaroski","14 March 2022","I had no idea what to expect from this movie. The couple reviews I heard had only mentioned that No Way Home was ""surprising"". I was ready to be disappointed to say the least. However I quite enjoyed it. For awhile many people have wondered how the individual spider man movies fit into the same narrative and how they conceptualized it was impressive. Not to mention the fact that they were able to get the original actors from the other spider man movies.. Absolutely loved the banter between the spider men and the loyalty they had for their own story within their respective universe. I also liked the set up for continuation with another Doctor Strange movie. I hope we can see more of him in the future.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kemal-44877","4 February 2022","VFX and sound is awesome as always. However, the story is forgettable and hard to relate. Peter is very annoying for the whole first act and although he's there for the second and third act, somehow his presence disappears. I watched it on IMAX just to see if I'd enjoy it fully, but nope. I'd prefer Eternals over this one. There are some emotional moments that are nicely done. You feel the heartbreak for sure. Some moments on the other hand feels fake. Dr. Octopus talks too much that he becomes annoying as well. And I'll never understand why Peter lets them all out from the prison at once.","

And his two best friends couldn't act to save their own skin. Frankly, the movie wouldn't have survived more than 4 stars if not for Tobey and Garfield's presence. The whole plot was a flop to be honest, I can't understand why they would even go for it. I mean the idea was great but the execution was terrible esp the introduction of the two spideys. And how in the world did Spidey outsmart Dr Strange in his own world, but he couldn't handle a mere human like Green Goblin?! And he was able to scoop up MJ and make a run for it but he couldn't pick up Aunt May and rush her to the hospital? Absolutely childish. Don't believe all the amazing reviews, they are just diehard marvel fans.Question, do different people write the scripts for each Spidey because Garfield's lines are the best.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","nightcrawler-01053","29 January 2023","Given the second film I should've known better, but I wanted to give No Way Home a chance in the hope Dr. Strange could save it from the mediocrity that was Jake Gyllenhall as Mysterio. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.This film is so inconsistent with its tone it's honestly laughable. Peter Parker botches Strange's spell multiple times whilst he's mid-casting it even though Strange tells him not to? Since when did Strange become stupider than a 17 year old kid.Spider-Man then defeats Strange in his own dimension using geometry based maths... Um, what?Aunt May dies and then in the lab MJ asks Peter if he's okay and his immediate response is ""Yeah, I'm fine."" Um, what? Aside from the tonal inconsistencies it really is nothing more than yet another Marvel/Disney CGI borefest; where nothing that happens involving any of the villains is remotely believable as far as suspension of disbelief goes.All the incidental characters just behave and act as though everything's normal and fine and they haven't just been through or seen the most traumatic experience of their entire lives. It's all so utterly fake and inconsequential.Unfortunately, this is just like every other copy and paste Marvel movie that fails to engage its audience with characters that actually have emotional depth. As it stands, No Way Home is a soulless, vacuous slog that entertains to some degree, but doesn't show anything that comes close to being meaningful.","

Sheer nostalgia aside, it actually finally felt like a spiderman movie, and we all knew it was a long time coming. It is the perfect place and perfect way for tom Holland's web slinger to part ways from MCU and head off to sony and homestly no jard feelings there. Well no movie is perfect but this, this was damn close, almost as good as endgame. Trust me when you see it in the theatres the atmosphere is awesome with all the web heads around.And one does not go without watching the end credit and both of them completely awesome.It had been mere speculation but now finally seeing Charlie Cox's daredevil is awesome really awesome..

Unfortunately people spoiled that Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire where going to be in it and they were just, didn't know when they were going to be in what scene. It was a great movie and when those two other Spider-Man came out my theatre ereputed with cheers and I have never seen so many people cheer or shout since Avengers Endgame and it was amazing. This movie was definitely the best Spider-Man movie they have made and definitely beats the other two Tom Holland Spider-Man films. I do wish we would have seen them mention the name ""Sinsister Six"" as if you know the comics you would know what that means but it was nice too see villains from all three franchises just wish we would have saw more and more dialogue with them and there Spider-Man's. Side note would have been a 10/10 if they put more Daredevil in the movie more and not just one scene but overall 8/10. Overall great movie just need some minor changes.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","fciocca","28 September 2022","""No Way Home"" is an ambitious project that tries to unite Spider-Man fans of different generations and I have appreciated this effort. I am not against fan-service movies, as long as the plot is interesting and well developed. It is a film that overwelcome its staying, with a length of almost two hours and a half. I had to split the viewing on two different days, because I was getting really bored. There are tons of scenes that needed to be cut, as some plot points are completely useless. The premises are ridiculous: basically all the mess happening in the film is due to some Peter's whim. Therefore all the fights that we see against the villains were perfectly avoidable, if only Doctor Strange was a bit more responsible and would just clarify with Parker his intentions, before executing the spell. It baffles me that such a powerful sorcerer commits these mistakes, it does not make any sense.It is enjoyable seeing three different Spider-Men generations united in one great movie with their respective enemies to fight. However due to the excessive length, this meeting between Parkers came way too late, when my attention span was already really, really low. There are a few good moments between them, but there are many cringey jokes, worth probably of a preteen audience. Dialogues are cheesy and annoying. It is sad that screenwriters could not come with something a bit more creative and well thought out, especially considering that this was the big reunion that a lot of fans were waiting for a long time. It is a disappointing result that does not really add anything new to the big cinematic universe: once again the multiverse is mentioned, and finally we start to see a glimpse of some consequences of this topic on the MCU, but it is not enough, especially for a two hours and a half movie. If you are a die hard fan, maybe you will enjoy this movie more than I did. For me it was a wasted opportunity to do something really great.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","rgkarim","17 December 2021","LIKES:The Special Effects:
Disney's resources can be used to craft amazing pieces, and No Way Home shows just how much of the good stuff they have when they put their time and money to it. Spiderman's dive into the multiverse is beautiful on almost all fronts in both design and animation. Dazzling displays of light, color, flashing, and explosions are blended together to make exciting, comic book feeling moments, all while getting hit with darker layers as the fight progresses. Spiderman facing the various villains seen in the trailer are fantastic, as web slinging, dodging, and various blasting occurs to rock the screen with amazing, theater rumbling effects. It's a very cinema worthy movie for this alone, but there is so much more to it.The Comedy:
Disney is all about cramming the jokes into the movie to lighten things up, and sometimes they take it too far. Fortunately, No Way Home manages to keep the comedy in check, timing things at the opportune moments and hitting running gags to keep us ingrained in the MCU Spiderverse. The banter was mostly kept in check, each of the characters styles blended well together with awesome chemistry, and even better it was not too much to trip up the emotional moments this movie has, which is a fantastic balance for this reviewer.The Action:
For the most part, the fights and chases in this movie feel very much like something from the Marvel comic universe. Taking that classic Spiderman taunting, while implementing strategy, agility, and use of environment, led to some decent moments that were suspenseful and interesting to see what damage would be caused. As the movie's tone changed, the nature of the fights changed too to keep pace, and by the end it was an amazing blend of comedic, action, and emotion to paint a near perfect finale for me.The Acting:
Again, Marvel casted well in this movie and opens up so many great chemistry networks between the characters that were in this movie. Holland is still a wonderful blend of Peter Parker and Spiderman, who has taken the character again to further heights and pulls the character through the ringer. This movie puts the main character into the ringer and Holland does things so well to really grab that emotion and pull at your heart strings. Zendaya's quality still shines through, and her rendition of M. J. still holds the same core foundation, but starts to further evolve and grow the seeds planted at the end of Far From Home. Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is top notch as usual, he's fun, he's classy, and he really sets the stage for the future of the character in this bizarre multiverse being set up and is exciting to see this transition layering more onto the character. Jacob Betalon as Ned again rocks in the comedy moment, but also extends to some other moments that were again perfect for the story. Alfred Molena, reprises the role of Doc Oc super well, bringing the same narcissism intellect of the character, but diving back into the complexity of the character we had in the second movie. There are so many more to compliment, but I can't due to potential for spoilers, but rest assure that the chemistry between this cast is a mixture of quality.Handling the Characters Well:
Spiderman: No Way Home had a lot of balls to juggle and for me, they did it quite well with the material they had to present. Extending the story from the end of the last movie, while mixing in Strange felt very natural, with adequate time spent listing out the problems and solutions the two ""Avengers"" had to find for the spell that went wrong. And once that door was opened, the complexity of the story required a lot more planning and direction. Watts and the team succeeded, managing to keep a lot of characters in the mix and making sure their inclusion was meaningful past the simple marketing for toys. Even the villains get some decent balance, again bringing their own interactions and plot components that for the most part were not forced or counteractive. It was a fantastic display of coordination and effort and given the potential disaster this could have been, I'm very much happy with the results.The Emotional Heart:
These movies and characters mean the world to the fans, and that means crossing into the heartstring pulling territory. No Way Home hits this several times, and I loved the moral testing components that they wrote in here for so many characters. Diving deeper into these characters, we got past the simple good-guy vs. Bad-guy motif and instead got something much bigger that again justified the inclusion of so many things. This is certainly one of the clutch moments of the MCU and I dare say it was something that sets so much up for the rest of the wave.DISLIKES:Pacing at the beginning:
It's all about the set up and making sure we are ready for everything to happen in the movie. As such, that was the part of the movie that I found to be a little drawn out and boring at times for me. I don't know if I was just tired, or I was hoping for a little more movement or suspense and it took about the first thirty minutes before the first fight really kicked in. Once that happened, the pacing issues were very minor at that point, only going a bit fast a few times in how some of the twists were brought in.The Computer work at times:
As much as I enjoyed the special effects and CGI, I can't say that it was flawless. No Way Home does have moments where the computer look reared its head and took shortcuts into the less realistic looking realm. The very artificial movements, the digital look to the skin, and a few other moments did drop into the lower resolution. Again, a minor flaw for me, but something I have seen in the past get fans upset.The Action at Times:
There are times where the fighting really started to ramp up, finding a great pace and stride that was gearing up for a great Spiderman brawl. However, the action would then trip and lose that momentum with an abrupt ending. There were great moments where they achieved all those incredible fighting sequences, but there were times I would have liked a little more coordination and magic that we had with other films, especially at the end with the way they were solving some problems. It feels like they were running out of time and some cuts were made to offset the full coordination, but again this is still a nitpick moment for picking on to find the answer.Some of the Bad Guys Needed A Little More:
Doc Oc as I said earlier was a fantastic villain they did so much with and Green Goblin as well has the bite that feels like an extension of the classic character. However, the Lizard and Sandman (which have been seen in the trailers), felt a little more time was needed to further expand upon their characters more and give them the same bite they held long ago. I know the reasons they were brought in for the most part, but... there still could have been some more fun with them to help get a little more mojo and time with them would have been amazing.Predictable:
I got most of the twists they were trying to surprise us with. Lots of foreshadowing handed you the keys to getting the big events that were going to happen and how they were going to help repair the mess they were looking. I can't say that the call of things being a surprise were really a surprise. However, this minor dislike still does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie for me.The VERDICT:
Spiderman No Way Home achieved a lot of greatness for this reviewer and makes me feel a little more comfortable from what is coming out of Marvel in the future. It's a fun movie that has so much to it and really brings forth an amazing experience meant for viewing in the theater. It's exciting, it's got heart, it's got comedy, and it keeps many things in the air with a balanced manner that was certainly exceeding the expectations that I had going in. No Way Home shows the multiverse may be in good hands and if they can continue this art of balance of new ideas and foundations, then we are in good hands. Sure, there are some pacing issues at time, some simplified solution finding, and a few characters needing a little more time. However, overall, this film is in the top Spiderman movies and I strongly encourage you to see it in the theater if you can find the time.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5.","

Spider-man's identity is revealed to be Peter Parker, whose life gets turned upside down, and he is faced with his greatest challenge yet.No Way Home is a great superhero film filled with amazing action, heart-wrenching emotional scenes, and incredible surprises. If you have watched Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame you will see many similarities. Both in the sheer scope of the film and in the epic nature in which it unfolds. In my theater the audience erupted several times, cheering and applauding.The action is hard-hitting and significantly more violent than previous Spider-Man movies from Marvel which adds something new and great to this film. The story is also great which both makes for an amazing movie and it paves the way for plenty of great movies to come. The movie also features the best performance from Tom Holland yet. He is finally coming into his own as Spider-Man and it is honestly amazing to see.Go see this movie immediately. Do your best not to get spoiled and see it in the cinema. You won't be disappointed. Spider-Man: No Way Home is the greatest Spider-Man movie I've ever seen and one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen as well.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","neil-476","22 December 2021","Peter Parker, outed as Spider-Man, and framed for Mysterio's death (see previous film), asks Dr Strange to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. But things go horribly wrong, and the multiverse suddenly gets very real indeed.The trailer reveals the Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 makes an appearance, thus linking the MCU with the original Spider-Man franchise, but it is worth watching all 5 pre-MCU movies beforehand because there are moments here which payoff all those movies.This is a very good movie notwithstanding the fan service. It's a good story, the action and effects are first rate, the performances are excellent, and there is a lot of emotion. Far From Home was very good, albeit a more intimate movie after the cosmic goings-on in Infinity War and Endgame, but No Way Home makes it clear that Phase 4 will be as capable of weaving intimate personal issues and massive threats as Phase 3 was.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","stativechicken","20 December 2021","This film was brilliant, this was the best mcu film since avengers infinity was, and probably one of the best superhero films ever made, this represents everything Spider-Man is about, everything felt so natural and unforced (maybe except the great power comes great responsibly line), and it makes the marvel universe feel so natural, with the cameo from daredevil to him visiting doctor strange, it is the perfect Spider-Man movie and a blast to watch.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","omgajjar-00698","8 March 2022","This movie can be said as one of the best film in the world. I mean like 'What a time to be alive!' for the fans of Spider-Man who grew up watching all the Spider-Man films in the cinema. It was a masterpiece combination of all Spider-Man films.When Doc. Otto Octavius first appeared in the movie and asked Spider-Man about his Machine of the power of sun, I was speechless and moreover, all the actors who played the role of villains of past Spider-Man films were still looking fit like they looked in the past films of Spider-Man.Another moment when I was speechless was when Andrew and Tobey showed up in the movie. Some of the scenes of three of them were quite entertaining like when they were talking about the villains they have fought and referring to all past Spider-Man films which gave me Nostalgic feeling of my childhood.The direction work done by Jon Watts was amazing but there was not much in the story plot when we compare it with Far From Home or EndGame, but still it was entertaining.This movie made the audience laugh, cry, feel angry, shock, feel nostalgic and much more so overall this movie is one of the best film ever made on the Earth.*BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY ELECTRO (MAX) WAS IN THE FILM AS HE DIDN'T KNEW THAT PETER PARKER IS SPIDER-MAN?*They should have been cast Dane DeHaan in the place of Jamie Fox as Harry Osborn (Green Goblin) knew that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.(Still saying it again) This film was totally entertaining for all Spider-Man fans!","

I must say by far the best MCU spider-man film to date. They handle the question of revenge so great I think. The ending is just yeah phenomenal. I don't even know what to say barely left the theater before I started to write this both Tobey and Andrew back. (sorry Nicholas Hammond maybe next time). If you love any of the 2 previous versions you will most likely love this movie since there are a bunch of references and actors from those are returning back. Peter Parker also have good character growth at the end of the movie he doesn't feel like a kid anymore. He feel a lot mroe mature and finally is standing on his own legs. It is great watch it if you haven't. Honestly you shouldn't even read this if you haven't watched it.","

This was a Marvel happy meal. Spiderman No Way Home was perfect. It was such a treat seeing them all bouncing off each other and Dr Strange. I am not going to go into a synopsis of the movie as there are plenty of reviews doing just that so I don't need to. Needless to say, this is the best of them so far. The performances are brilliant, you can see how much fun everyone is having here.

That's fine, but that shouldn't be the whole substance of the movie.I liked the scenes with Dr. Strange more than the scenes with Spider-Man. Unfortunately, Dr. Strange isn't in the movie very much.If you like a lot of call backs to other movies, then you'll love this film.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","vipham941","23 December 2021","I'll be honest, I was going this expecting the hype around the film to exceed its quality but it was delightfully surprising.Despite knowing the biggest and most exciting twist of the film (thanks internet), the film managed to surprise and deliver.With the absolute stand out performance of Tom Holland as Spider-Man and the surprise appearance of a few familiar faces, the film delivers in an action packed yet still emotionally powerful way quickly and easily becoming the best of the MCU's Spider-Man movies.The only real criticism I have of this film is it's reliance on past characters and films to carry the narrative of the film. Rather than coming up with new ideas for Spider-Man and the future of his character in the MCU, they chose to rehash old favourites. Whilst I understand that to a certain extent, it is a little disappointing to see so much of the film hinge on it.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","imiea","16 December 2021","""Where do we go from here?"" is the biggest question I have after leaving the cinema. The possibilities are endless both for Spiderman and the MCU as a whole.Firstly, this movie absolutely delivers on so many levels. So often, the hype for a film could leave you disappointed but not this one. Fan service is at the very core of No Way Home but at the same time it ties in beautifully to what we're seeing with this new phase of MCU projects.With all the craziness, epic moments, secrets and reveals, I was worried this movie will take the attention away from Tom Holland's Spiderman but if anything it just adds to his story arch and sets up an amazing potential future for the character. I honestly can't wait to see what comes next for Spiderman and Peter Parker. Holland does a fantastic job and we really get to see just how good of an actor he is in this movie. No Way Home is filled with fantastic visuals and plenty of emotion, and in classic MCU style, thrilling action, your usual one liners and (not always, but definitely in this film) a storyline that keeps the Marvel steam train running at full force.There are many scenes in this film that will leave long time Spidey fans feeling like a kid again and is exactly what you'd expect it to be. The feeling of joy, nostalgia, excitement and to some extent, relief, was truly magical and I'm forever grateful to have experienced it. It would be extremely difficult to ever witness something like this on the big screen again. Thank you Marvel, and thank you Sony.In my opinion, there are some areas in the film 's storyline where it suffers a bit. Some of the character's decisions are a bit Strange (no pun intended) in parts with certain events being questionable. But then again, that's the tricky part with these films. It's science fiction and you can never read too much into the details. Sometimes its best to just accept it for what it is, which in this case, is an epic superhero adventure.Despite the VERY minor questionable plot details, No Way Home is undoubtedly a phenomenal film that will go down as one of the greatest superhero films of all time. It is a true love letter to Spiderman fans and an event that will surely open up a multitude of possibilities for the MCU.","

The Avengers are all but diminished and the new Avengers are being shaped for what seems to be formidable challenges ahead as we enter into a Multi Verse of the Universe were what came before will seem like a drop in the ocean on more levels than one. Very enjoyable great concept and brilliant cinematic magic, I was losing hope for this genre but it seems we have turned a corner lately and I have enjoyed The Ten Rings and this Spider-Man a lot more so I say more of the same please.......","

This movie is packed with each and every element, a roller coaster of emotions. In these 2.5 hours you'll laugh, cry and scream. Overall, This movie ended up being way above my expectations..

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jdowney-57-371157","10 May 2022","I am pretty stunned that this movie is as popular as it is. It's basically a contrived gimmick to pull together the characters from past Spidey incarnations and crack a lot of jokes.I have never been a fan of Tom Holland's take on Spiderman as a good hearted teen-ager being overly deferential to every adult he deals with. It's a one-note performance and from the start it's been contrived and unconvincing. Andrew Garfield relied on looking at the ground and foot-shuffling when he was trying to portray Spiderman. Holland just calls everyone 'Sir' all the time.So...in a stupid corny contrived scene, Spiderman can't shut up long enough to allow Dr. Strange to cast a spell and everything is set in motion. Dimensional reality is breached and the other Spider Men from other Universes wind up in the new Spider Man's reality. So do all the old baddies from the old movies. Doc Occ/Goblin/SandMan/Electro/Lizard Man. So the three Spideys + Zendaya and her giant nose and Spider's Nerd Pal join together to correct the histories of multiple universes and they succeed but at a huge cost.There is a ton of 'jokey' humour in this junk food burger that doesn't work. There are standard Marvel CGI effects. There are a strangely bunch of complacent half-hearted no motivation baddies.The whole thing is horribly contrived, doesn't make sense, the characters don't act in sensible fashion, and our Hero is left with nothing but his super-hero identity....which we are left with the idea that that is all he needs because it is his destiny.Plot wise this movie was as bad as The Eternals. It is basically a movie for kids I guess. Fundamentally it was simple, stupid, contrived. Like a Big Mac, it filled you up, left you sluggish and wishing you had eaten something of better quality.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kgprophet","18 December 2021","While this third movie in the latest trilogy of Spiderman films will more than placate the fanboys and fangirls out there, it is at a cost. This movie could have easily clocked in at two hours and feel like the perfect blockbuster movie. But no. After the finale, the ""good byes"" stretch on and on. Then of course there is baiting for other upcoming MCU movies. Even the fun jokey jokey scenes that are the hallmark of this franchise get cringe-worthy sometimes. I still give this movie a thumbs up, because it took a concept and found some fun with it. There is a little bit of manipulation, with more than a few tear jerker scenes (really? How many times do you need to push the waterworks?). But the biggest thing this movie has going for it is re-thinking the villains. Instead of the villains arriving and being bad guys, we find a way to make them sympathetic, and the audience will go along with the alternate storyline.I also like Benedict Cumberbatch. He fares well as a secondary character that only appears in the movie every once in a while. At the heart of the success of this current iteration of the Spiderman franchise is the friendship, particularly MJ and Ned. They stay integral to the center of the story quite intentionally, so you feel this is more of an ensemble piece that the previous two movies. However, the expected fan service (rumors are true) takes over and becomes the twist in the story. The concept of multiple universes has been pushed by Marvel for the last couple years, and here it is used as a vehicle for conflicts that arise.So I enjoyed the story, the treatment of the villains, plus the high buck action scenes we expect, and the supporting characters. For that reason, I will declare this film is the best of the three. Just get ready for some tugs at the heart in the third act, where you may find yourself getting a little annoyed that another music cue (the solitary piano notes with the sad violin) is making you well up again.I will give this a 7 out of 10, despite the extra half-hour of hugging.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Dello_","17 December 2021","On the surface Spider-Man: No Way Home is highly entertaining, funny and with some heartfelt moments and all contributes to a satisfying view. It is great too see again some old villains and in general there is a lot of fan service but is done well and it's not annoying. The movie is also able to trigger people reactions and if you watch this movie in a passionate theatre the experience will be great because you can hear the sounds of the people around you, and it was something that I didn't experience since the pandemic has started and it was nice. You'll probably walk out from the viewing with very positive vibes and with high levels of satisfaction. BUT if you start think about it with a more critical view the magic will vanish because nothing makes sense. The premise is so stupid and the movie happens because Peter had suddenly become retarded, and not only him. Things happen because we will never know (like the reason for the return of the villains, the movie tries to give an explanation but in reality doesn't). And realistically what is the probability that between an infinite number of universes could happen exactly what has happened in the movie? How fortunate we were! And also the finale (that is very very satisfying and emotional) comes from a sudden change of the rules established previously in the movie. And so you can see that everything is only a pretext to please fans but without a real structure or a good premise behind it. The plot is useful only for the fan service. And if on one hand it is what has made my watching an experience, it is something that has to be noted. And so I am divided between my fan nature that has liked this movie and my rational and objective nature that dislikes it because of the nonsense of the plot. And so in conclusion what I can say is: go watch it for the experience without expecting a good movie, only a collection of cool scenes.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","guskeller","17 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home is clever fan service. The usual MCU self-references are present, but No Way Home takes a step further, acknowledging previous Spider-Man eras as its central story. Turning references into legitimate plot points deserves credit. Furthermore, the cast is truly stunning and the main selling point here. The film successfully brings all these eras together and gives everyone time to shine. Naturally, this all helps the acting too because the excellent cast clearly enjoys their roles. Add in the patented MCU filmmaking baseline, and the result is a surefire hit.However, No Way Home's gimmicks do not make a masterpiece. On a technical level, the film is still basic MCU. Occasionally, there is abstract sound and visual craft, but those aspects are mostly standard. The same goes for the editing, music, and production, which all meet (but rarely elevate) the material. Lastly, the writing and direction both get lost in the massive shuffle. This is the most epic MCU Spider-Man, and, unfortunately, the least heartfelt. The tone isn't focused and the emotional beats aren't earned. The attempts are decent, but don't resonate amongst the excitement. Nevertheless, No Way Home is certainly everything the fanboys want.Writing: 6/10

The rest of the villains were also pretty good a part from the lizard who didn't really have anything to do. Tobey and Andrew coming back was also great and it was good to see 3 generations of Spider-Man coming together.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","User145111","10 August 2022","People kept whooping. They kept on cheering at every little thing. We get it, you remember things from old movies. Now please be quiet so that we can actually hear the dialogue. Yes, everyone here is a Marvel fan; the characters on the screen can't hear you. Chances are no one involved in the filmmaking process is here in this screening so there is no need to clap and applause.A hefty amount of nostalgia bait, some crippling plot holes and inexplicable character choices make up what is the best Spider-Man 3.Should have brought back the Aunt May from the Rami trilogy. We needed another monologue about heroism.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","haleygalea","23 February 2022","As a long time Marvel and Spider-Man fan, this movie completed my childhood. Watching Maguire's, Garfield's and Holland's Spider-Mans come together created the most perfect Marvel movie to exist (thus far). It involves the most exceptional combination of comic relief scenes (mainly involving all three Spider-men) which created light-hearted moments and in contrast, melancholic scenes which bring you to tears (more than you already will be).","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","unpopicakbill","16 March 2022","Yet another Marvel movie, garbage-in garbage-out category. Trying to be both inventive, and still relying on good characters vs bad characters, and if one changes, it does from good to bad or vice-versa, but having no human emotion. So this feels like scripted by an AI of Apple, studying 5-year olds.All this being said, one will watch it nonetheless, because it is over rated, to the point it made it to top 250. But on the way our it will end it in the Marvel pile of movies, where it rates as about as average, maybe an inch above.So for me these movies rank as 4/10, with these new copycat at 5/10. In my view, don't bother, but one cannot be really stopped in wasting 2.5hrs of their life that easy!","

It's one of those movies where the whole thing is driven by how dumb the main character is and the stupid choices they make.Don't do X. Does X.Don't trust Y. Trusts Y.Use Z to fix the problem. Doesn't use Z.Repeat.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","notareviewer","19 December 2021","I'm not going to lie, having heard so many great things about this film made me a little dissapointed during the first hour of this film. Sure, it was enjoyable but I was expecting something spectacular waiting anxiously on the edge of my seat. But, in the end i was so far from dissapointed. This movie truly has everything a good ""superhero"" movie can have. Lots of great friendship and love scenes, fight scenes and those really, really intense scenes. But the thing that makes this movie stand out the most is because spiderman carries the sense of humanity. This movie made me cry, laugh, irritated and even a little bit angry sometimes and that's what makes it so great. The emotions made it the best spiderman movie so far. One moment that really made me cry was when Garfield (spiderman 3) catches MJ, not wanting Holland (spiderman 1) to feel the same sorrow he felt for Gwen. I also feel like you get the most out of this movie if you've watched all of the spiderman movies made, it gets you really sentimental.If you haven't seen this movie yet then you really have to as soon as you can, one of the best movies i've seen this year.","

But what makes this one the best spiderman movie for me, is the fact that all ingrediants are there. Great original story, lots of great action, solid acting from all involved, fast and funny. Simply a great ride! Coming from a guy that collected spiderman comics around in 1970.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","sebastianschlicht","7 March 2022","There you go, Marvel, it's possible! After ""Avengers Endgame"" the quality of most MCU films was extremely disappointing in my eyes. Neither films nor series could really convince me. But my last hope rested on the third and (for now?) last ""Spider-Man"" film with Tom Holland. And who would have thought it, but ""No Way Home"" (2021) made it! The film refreshed the MCU and in my opinion is the best thing Marvel has done in a long time in so many ways. But where do you start with this film? Difficult, because it's hard to tell anything about the story without spoilers, so I'll go into spoilers later, but of course point them out first.Peter's identity was revealed by Mysterio and now he has to live with the consequences. His personal life is over, but so are his friends MJ and Ned. And if that wasn't enough, many people believe that Peter killed Mysterio. Spidey sees no alternative but to seek out Doctor Strange. Because he might have a solution for his problem...It's almost impossible to go into the film without any prior knowledge, because the trailers alone tell you very clearly what to expect. But of course they don't reveal everything, which I at least welcome. Still, I recommend anyone who hasn't seen the trailer (if thats even an option for anyone) to avoid it and go into the movie as fresh as possible.""No Way Home"" is the third film in this still quite young trilogy, which actually doesn't really work without the ""Avengers"" films (and many other individual films from the MCU), but you can say that we all have a real, complete Spider-Man series for the first time. Both the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield films ended quite openly. And while Tom Holland will certainly continue, this film is a kind of conclusion for the Avengers-Spidey.The story in this film takes on unexpected dimensions and for a long time I had the feeling that there were real stakes. I noticed that especially with the action. A lot of Marvel movies have those clearly defined action moments that are meant to look cool and epic (so you can put them into the trailers), but here the Peter Parker story came first. Each scene seemed like a natural progression from the one before, and I really liked that. I also think it's great that Tom Holland's character has to face the biggest challenges since Thanos. It's his film and his story. And it has never been as good as it is here. Holland is a great actor who has been fantastic as Spider-Man so far, but it's only here that I think he really matures into a character. The rest of the cast is great too, I really like Zendaya and Jacob Batalon in this film and they also develop into fleshed out characters.But that's not all: The action and the visuals of the film have improved. While technically good, the first two Spidey films were never as impressive as Sam Raimi's trio. Here, however, some people seem to have really thought about it. ""No Way Home"" is visually very impressive, wild and at times beautiful. Michael Giacchino (again) does a great job with his score and lets the Spidey theme sound really powerful with a few moments of goosebumps.The film isn't quite perfect, as many logic gaps are opened up in order to advance the story. BUT: That never bothered me because the fun, the emotions and the huge surprises were more than worth it. A movie has to entertain me and ""No Way Home"" did that every second. And that's exactly why I forgive the film's small weaknesses. Also, in an MCU film with magic and spider powers, you have to accept some supernatural and crazy things.But from here I have to enter spoiler territory. So if you haven't seen the film yet, you should NOT read on and jump to the conclusion. Here's your warning, so go ahead!SPOILER Alert!It was clear from the trailers that there would be an overlap with the previous Spidey universes. But even before that, there was speculation, fantasizing and there were first leaks. I think that's why everyone wanted to see this film. But despite all the fantastic appearances, ""No Way Home"" is still a film that not only does (great) fan service, but creates a new story with old characters. Especially the villains from the Raimi and Marc Webb universe refresh the whole thing nicely. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe as Osborne are the stars here, but Jamie Foxx as Electro also gets a new take on his character. Sandman and the Lizard are there and the actors (Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans) give their voice for them, but the ending shots with the actors were (unfortunately) used from earlier films. At least we get to enjoy J. K. Simmons again as J. Jonah Jameson. This time he is a paranoid maniac who spreads consiracy theories, but it works.In addition, the idea that all villains should be healed is really great. No typical good versus evil, but Holland's Peter Parker wants to give these antagonists a new chance. At the same time, however, he is also struggling with the consequences of his leaked identity.But what would this film be without the appearances of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield? How much I wished for that and it came true. And both aren't just simple cameos, they both have integral roles in the story. And this is where the magic of the film comes into play. Something like this will probably never happen again, it's unique. And I never thought that Marvel could make me feel this overflowing enthusiasm again, like last time in ""Endgame"". Seeing Tobey Maguire again as Spider-Man was magical. And Garfield gets to save MJ in free fall, bringing some closure to his trauma with Gwen. Absolutely fantastic!The question is, of course, is it possible to see and enjoy the film without the Maguire and Garfield films? Yes. But of course the effect without these films isn't even remotely as great. And honestly, what Spidey fan hasn't seen the other movies? There's even a small, funny reference to Miles Moralis.SPOILERS end!Conclusion: What a movie. What a Spider-Man movie. ""No Way Home"" was the most fun I had in the cinema since ""Endgame"". Marvel still has this magical potential somehow and director Jon Watts got almost everything out of this story. An absolute festival that entertained and touched me like hardly anything else in 2021!","

This film seemed to be made with love for the character and the audiences who love him.And him. And him too.SPOILERS:Tobey Maguire was my first Spiderman as a kid and Spiderman 2 holds up to this day. Seeing Alfred Molina and Tobey share a scene together was absolutely touching. Andrew Garfield's performance was chock full of nuance and gave his Spiderman a proper send off. As lame as his films were, his Spiderman was a lot of fun and deserved better.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","nicolasverdessm","31 July 2022","Greate movie, def is for the fans that grew up with spiderman's movies and waited years for this. To me is an 8 bc is fun, has some nostalgic value, and is nice to see old faces and how those characters grew, that said it wasn't that much, but still.The action scenes could have being better, there are a lot of characters and it felt underwealming, the sand dude has no reason to fight against the spidermen, Doc Oc is a cool character, why not make him fight? Whats with all of them knowing they where going to die, dd they revive? Why not at the end make people forget about Spiderman and not Peter??Don't think is very rewatchable, but had a great time. (even tho I knew the other Spidermen where going to appear, why no one talked about the bad guys or Murdok, that was a surprise to me and I watched like a year and a half of its release)","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","classicsoncall","6 January 2022","I believe this film entered IMDb's 'Top 250' at number #9, briefly rose to #8, and has now settled down into the 17th spot as I write this, right between ""The Matrix"" and ""Goodfellas"". I go on this little rant every time a new comic book super-hero movie comes out, because in anyone's wildest imagination, this cannot possibly be the 17th best movie of all time. Not that it will stay there as time goes by, but it just boggles my mind how a movie's audience and IMDb voters can impact a film's standing when it first comes out. Anyway, enough of that.For me, I thought the picture was quite a fun and entertaining experience. The idea of the two former Spider-Man actors returning to the big screen to help out Tom Holland's current depiction of the character was just a marvelous touch. Combined with many of the past Spidey villains and that quick cameo by Charlie Cox as Attorney Matt Murdoch made this an exciting and unexpected pleasure. Anywhere else the whole multiverse concept could have been a huge bungle, but the screenwriters here did a competent job of melding the disparate universes into a cohesive story that didn't seem far fetched within the context of Spider-Man's comic book history.With over four thousand reviews already posted here for this movie, there's not a whole lot I'm able to add to the discussion. Just know that if you go see this movie, it will quite likely exceed your expectations via creative story telling and superb visual effects. In other words, it's what you go to the theater for.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","TheBabayaga","15 December 2021","I give infinite credit to the writers and producers at Sony (and Disney). They knew exactly what the fans wanted and likewise expected; and No Way Home delivers beyond the enormous hype. Not since Captain America wielded Thor's hammer in Endgame has a cinema erupted with such joy and vivacious cheering.And never have I smiled so much: NWH is bursting with delightful chemistry, Easter eggs, truly impeccable fan service and a never ending supply of fun and emotion in equal measure, all of which helps to elevate NWH in becoming the most joyous and ambitious entry in the MCU thus far.Spider Man has truly become something of an icon; and No Way Home, if nothing else, is a jubilant celebration of Peter Parker and his alter ego, including both his comic and onscreen iterations (past and present).9.5/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","AfricanBro","21 December 2021","This first part's not about the movie itself but the experience I had which I'll now always associate with the movie now. Okay so I bought 4DX tickets and it was my first time, it's crazy man. The seat started moving around like a roller coaster, wind was blowing, when the scene was somewhere cold in the movie the cinema got cold all of a sudden, water was being sprinkled everywhere, chair was vibrating and moving all over my back. The wind and water was coming from different directions, hit me behind my ears, in my face from the from the seat infront, from the sides, under and behind my ankles. I expected it, but was still really stunned. And I got a large Pepsi which I finished in about 20min and didn't pee before the movie, which is 3hr long if you consider the cinema ads in the beginning, so halfway through I had to pee really bad and the seat was throwing me around, my bladder hurt so badüòÇ didn't want to miss a thing so I had to wait for the movie to end and people were staring at me all weird 'cause I was the only one leaving since we all wait for the post credit scenesüòÇ there are two of them.But my outtake from the movie, what stood out the most to me is Tom Halland is really good at playing sad scenes, every time I see him sad or crying I feel like I wanna cry too, the African in me doesn't allow it but I do. That Andrew Garfield scene also made me wanna cry. Spider-Man's not one of my favorite heroes but I think this is one of the best movies marvel has made so far, and I love how each of the Spider-Mans all brought back the same feeling their individual movies had back then, it was great to see. Not really a complaint but I wasn't really convinced Dr. Strange was that oblivious to the consequences of what he and Spider-Man were doing, he accepted doing the favour way too easily and didn't seem surprised when everything went haywire; and can't really blame it on the acting because Cumberbatch is astounding so I'll assume it's a ""giving thanos the time stone"" kinda situation. Unlike some MCU movies, this one didn't make the fan theories seem bonkers.The movie's quite long and takes you through different emotions, I got happy, then sad, then surprised then sad again and I think good movies should do that. Recent trend in superhero movies is to make them more comedic and I love it but thought was getting a bit too far because I think movies like Let There Be Carnage should have been much darker and gory, with a higher rating like R 18 even with the funny bits, not to say the same about Spider-Man, but i think they got the comedy-drama-action blend perfectly here. I was honestly surprised it's maintaining a 9/10 rating even after being released a couple days but it is as good as they say.","

In hopes of restoring some balance to their lives, Peter asks Dr. Strange to cast a spell that will make everyone forget he is Spiderman.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Laura_Ratings","14 March 2022","Definitely an amazing movie. The reunion was so special to see, it was wonderful to see the previous 2 spidermans in this movie. I really, really loved it. It proves that it is not always bad to bring back some of the elements, characters or even actors from the previous movies. It takes skill to implement old elements, treat them with respect and make them turn out great in a new movie. The fact that Andrew's Peter Parker saved this universe's MJ was a touch that must have had long-time fans (me included) grabbing for tissues.Other than that I can't wait to see the next movie. I think Tom is a great Spiderman, though all 3 of the actors are the best Spiderman, there simply isn't one who is better than the other. They all portrayed the character in amazing but different ways and it's lovely to see them together to notice their impact.Furthermore, all performances in this movie were great, I really can't think of any bad points in this movie. Definitely recommend watching.","

from a spider man movie. Great devolpent, cool fight scenes between spider man and the villains and it had great aspect of opportunity's. The way they handled the villains was great, every villain got their time on the screen and didn't use any of them to continue the plot. The villains wasn't useless and they put great aspects to the story witch was very satisfying. Too see villains like dock ock and Green goblin again on the big screen, just blowed my mind.I'm so great full now that we get to see a fully developed Spider-Man/Peter Parker in this film. I was so angry at marvel just how porley they have written this character and in every movie he is in i started to question WHO IS THIS GUY? I'm truly sorry for the Tom Hollands fan but his spider man is far from great, he hasn't have any cool moments in the MCU that we can remember years later. But in this film i was more entertained of how mature he is now after fricking six films. It was good that aunt may died so he can go through grief and finally redeem himself. After the film I was hyped to see Peters next chapter.There's a few scenes that bugs me out and that's of course the jokes and a few didn't land and the writing seemed bad sometimes during the movie, but that's just a nitpick.The amazing part of the movie was that we did explore the so called multi verse and in someday many characters will clash together from other universes, we did see that in this film and oooooooooo boy I was screaming like a baby. Too see the three generations of spider men clashing together to stop the villains was just breathtaking to see. I loved every second of it and just to see Andrew and Tobey back was emotional. Tobey is my favourite spider man but during the film I was most hyped about Andrew, because I wondered how they were going to handle his character after Gwens death. I'm glad to say this that this film full field Andrews spider man. To see his redemption gave me goosebumps.10/10.",NA
