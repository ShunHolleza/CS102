"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","poseyfan","10 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ta-98251","4 May 2023","Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jace_the_film_guy","8 May 2023","Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax
Best Quote: ""She is to us.""
Best Scene: Infiltrating Orgocorp

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","gcsman","7 May 2023","""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","AfricanBro","3 May 2023","Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them. Oh and I forgot to mention it's pretty funny.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","breneff","3 May 2023","This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","josephbannister","4 May 2023","It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel. Trust me this is a great film.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","georgewhittingham1","3 May 2023","A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","coasteraddict-16796","10 May 2023","I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short. I never expected to fall in love with this movie, but it got to me in such a visceral way that I'll never forget the experience of seeing it.The best marvel film, ever. 10/10.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cthirlby","3 May 2023","This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie! Loved it to bits!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ossie85","3 May 2023","This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Mysterygeneration","11 May 2023","The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Chance_Boudreaux19","5 May 2023","So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Jeremy_Urquhart","3 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Stephanie4040","7 August 2023","I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends). While it ends up mostly okay, I'm never watching it again as long as I live. Triggered all sorts of childhood movie PTSD - not sure it needed to be that harsh and traumatising to be honest!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Her-Excellency","10 May 2023","This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.","

It had a heart- rending back story.It had a meaner villain than almost every other Marvel studio film, since the Endgame.It did not have a pack of super heroes confronting the next existential threat for all of mankind.It is an almost perfect sendoff to the guardians. It is a James Gunn signature creation, with his creative imprint on the the look, feel and hear of every frame.I had postponed seeing this until now as every other Marvel film, except the second Black Panther, seemed to be derivative of every other film with only minor tweaks.This easily tops ALL of them, by some distance.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Ky-D","5 May 2023","Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","rexmatthewj","3 May 2023","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cardsrock","10 May 2023","This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","GusherPop","4 May 2023","James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","BenW1999","3 May 2023","Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","HardLight","8 May 2023","The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home. But I'm not lying about this.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","srdjan_veljkovic","6 May 2023","It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Ankhenaten91","5 May 2023","One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","PizzaBizza","7 May 2023","I am disappointed. Although Guardians 3 is not a bad movie per se, it is definetly the worst of the three.All the sillyness and light hearted jokes of the first two installments seemed just forced: The characters used to argue a lot in the previous movies too, but here the arguments seem more serious and sometimes the friendship actually looks damaged. Rocket gets the spotlight, but most of the background story is simply too dark. I wanted to watch the movie with my kids, but this is not a kids movie. The first two were kind of violent too, but not in this grim, dark and desperate way.Nebula does not seem to fit in the crew, Drax does not do much at all, Groot seems strangely hallow and 'unfinished', only Starlord and Gomorra have a somewhat interesting tension. Both the adult groot and baby groot from 1 and 2 had something going on, young Groot here seems to lack any personality. The writers did not know how to use this character. The actors sometimes played as if it was the last day before summer vacation - just get it done and forget about it.I always liked the family and friendship aspect of the first two, because it was somewhat ridiculed by the characters themselfs (""5 idiots standing in a circle"" from the first, or ""that unsaid thing"" between Gomorra and Starlord or Drax being gentle to Baby-Groot at the end of part 2), but here it's not embedded in the actions anymore. It has to be said, over and over again.For a Grand Finale it often feels too complex, too empty and too forced. Was it a bad movie - no, probably not, but it was for sure not up there with the other two. I will probably re-watch it in a couple of years, hopefully I like it more then. (""Endgame"" also grew on me, so there is hope.)It also sucks that there are so many fake ratings on IMDB, some even don't try to hide it.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","movieman6-413-929510","4 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is the third Guardians of the Galaxy movie in the Marvel movie series. This film is again directed and partly written by James Gunn, who also directed the two previous films.Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is still reeling from the loss of his beloved Gamora (Zoe Saldana). This loss causes him to still not be his old self. During a mission, Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) is injured by this.In order to save him, the other Guardians must confront his creator The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). This is a perfectionist, who is always trying to improve everything. It's probably not very familiar to leave Rocket in his hands.With this third film, James Gunn manages to close his trilogy nicely, but he leaves it in such a way that others could continue with the film series. After this film, James Gunn will resign from Marvel and will now continue as an executive for the DC superhero films. If Marvel decides to use the Guardians of the Galaxy for new further films in their film series, this will probably come across differently compared to the vision that James Gunn had with the series and characters.For his latest Guardians of the Galaxy film, James Gunn also takes a different direction for a change, making this film a bit darker and brutal. For example, there are different animals in the film and although these animals are not real in the film, most of them come across as realistic. When these animals are then modified by the villain of the film, who tries to make them more perfect, they show the best violent images in which this is done. These images are not really suitable for young viewers such as children under ten. Parents should take this into account if their children would like to see this film.In addition to the animals, James Gunn, together with the people who worked on the visual effects for this film, also manages to portray the other aliens in different, creative ways. They've done this with both visual and makeup effects. It sometimes seems as if you are watching a Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Unfortunately, all explosions do not always come across as credible, because with some explosions you can see that they are played on a green screen.The acting is also well done by the film cast. For this third film, most of them also get enough opportunities to play their well-known roles in other ways. Chris Pratt comes across as very depressed, especially in the beginning. Because this film plays on Rocket's backstory, Bradley Cooper now voices a younger version of the same character in addition to his now well-known voice as Rocket. With this third film and the events of the past Marvel films, Zoe Saldana now also gets a chance to portray Gamora's character in a different way. This version of Gamora is also a bit more brutal compared to how the character was portrayed in this way less and less in these films. With this film, she gets more of a chance to respond to the title that the character had in the comics: the deadliest woman in the whole galaxy. The rest of the returning cast also portray their characters in good manners, but not all get the chance to do something special with their characters in this new film. The well-known character from the comics Adam Warlock also finally appears in the Marvel film series. He is played by Will Poulter, but otherwise little special is done with the character. This may be a bit disappointing for fans of the character.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","bastille-852-731547","3 May 2023","When it came out in 2014, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" far exceeded most people's expectations. Don't get me wrong, it's not an earth-shattering masterpiece by any means, but its clever humor, endearing camaraderie between its quirky heroes, entertaining use of 80s music, and uniqueness compared to other Marvel films made it a breath of fresh air that many people really enjoyed. The second film was not as good as the first, but still enjoyable enough. Unfortunately, the third film is very disjointed and lacks any semblance of a compelling overarching story to really work. While devoted Marvel fans will probably enjoy it more than I did, I view the film as overall further evidence of the MCU's decline in quality since the Infinity Saga.In this film, the Guardians have to embark on a mission to protect (an injured) Rocket Raccoon from an evil villain, the High Evolutionary. The film alternates between garden-variety CGI/action setpieces and some surprisingly dark flashbacks to Rocket Raccoon's earlier life. Some viewers will be surprised by these flashbacks and find them to be more disturbing than they would expect from a ""Guardians"" movie. I do not think these scenes push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating (""The Batman,"" for example, contains scenes far more disturbing and graphic,) but parents bringing younger children starting to watch Marvel movies should note that their children could find them upsetting. The juxtaposition between the lighter humor and fun of the Guardians and these more tragic, trauma-based moments does not exactly work very well, since the plot is not compelling enough overall to justify the continued plot progression on both ends. The film's overall story is very generic and forgettable, and significant portions of the film feel surprisingly rather pointless in contributing to the such story. These concerns are intensified by the fact that the third act is pretty weak, and the first two acts don't really build up to it much.The writing and humor are much weaker than the previous two ""Guardians"" films, especially the first one. The comedy here feels surprisingly forced and lazy, rather than genuine and clever. Additionally, at two and a half hours (longer than both of the first two films,) the film's runtime really does overstay its welcome, especially given the relative lack of a consistently compelling plot--or even significant attempts at plot structure. The film still has some mildly entertaining set pieces and a great soundtrack, so it's not a total misfire by any means, but it's very disappointing compared to the previous two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films--especially considering how much less than the sum of its parts this film feels. 5.5/10Note: I saw an advance screening of the film in IMAX. The picture and sound quality were very good on the IMAX screen, and the film seemed to use the IMAX-expanded aspect ratio for nearly all of its running time.","

Some characters complete their arcs, others leave with open doors, it's nice. Narrative and tone are a little messy, but the hallway fight is cool, and the Guardians - when it's about them - fire on all cylinders. I love these people.Where it loses me is Rocket's origin story, and Gunn pushes the animal cruelty way ( ... *way* ... ) too far. It's transparent knife-twisting and I hate it. This is a dark turn for the series, absolutely, but also unbelievably painful.I can't.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Ayupgeeza","6 May 2023","I loved the first GotG, and enjoyed Vol. 2 a lot. For me they were original, quirky, funny films with an awesome soundtrack, great action sequences and a real feel-good factor to them.This third instalment attempts to carry some of those traits over, but it also wants to be a serious, emotional film as it works its way through Rocket's tortuous back story. These two opposing threads make for uncomfortable bedfellows, and it hits from the very start of the movie. Any anticipation I felt for the film dissipated rapidly in the first 10 very depressing minutes, and I struggled to regain much enthusiasm for it. Perhaps this was an inevitable consequence following the events of the last Avengers movie, but even so I didn't feel it was handled all that well.This was despite a pretty engaging revenge plot and a compelling and superbly portrayed primary antagonist. Adam Warlock was a welcome if somewhat underexplored addition to the cast, and a wide variety of imaginative and frequently grizzly selection of supporting characters were generally a bonus.In fact it was the Guardians themselves who disappointed. Rocket and Star-Lord were largely humourless throughout. The three female guardians, including - strangely - Mantis, melded into the same universally angry, shouty character. Only Drax seemed to me to add value, as he was both funny and had a nice bit of character development rolled into it.All in all, though this wasn't a bad film, it wasn't the film I was hoping it would be.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","bastos","5 February 2024","I've talked about this before, how expectations can mold your appreciation of a movie, so let me tell you what my mindset was coming into this one. I liked the first Guardians, although not as much as everyone else as I think Ronan is such a forgettable villain. I really didn't like the second one and thought it was a huge step down from the first one, it felt rushed and had another very weak villain. Marvel was coming off of a terrible string of movies and I even didn't like the Guardians Christmas special. I was still a fan of James Gunn though, and loved his Suicide Squad so there was that to look forward to. So, to say I wasn't expecting to like this one as much as I did is the understatement of the year. Another thing I wanted to talk about after watching this movie, was the much talked about superhero fatigue. When people mention it I think they tend to dismiss or forget that two incredible superhero movies came out this year alone (the other one being the Spiderverse movie, of course), so it just proves that if well written and well executed a superhero movie can still be really good, what people are tired is the terrible writing and lack of originality that populates most superhero movies released nowadays. Anyway, with all that out of the way, let me tell you just how much I loved this movie. It is incredibly well written, interweaving character development, emotional set pieces, comedy and action like it's nothing, with the highlight for me being the characters which are the heart of this thing. I mean, Star-Lord, Rocket, Gamora, Nebula, Drax, Mantis, Groot, even all the supporting characters like Cosmo, Kraglin or Adam Warlock, they're all so likable that you can probably ask ten different persons which one is their favorite, and you might get ten different answers. That's a testament of how good they all are! Execution wise, this is a beautiful movie, very well directed and the VFX for a change are actually good and serve to enhance the story. My only nitpick might be the villain that, although good conceptually and probably the best of this trilogy, is not as memorable as everything else, something that seems to plague all Gunn movies. Anyway, I really, really liked this movie and it is easily in my top five MCU movies. Highly recommended.","

It's a beautifully written film with so much great action sequences, comedic scenes & some really heart touching moments. The backstory for Rocket really messes you up seeing what he went through & how he had to witness all his friends being slaughtered. Although it makes you believe it at times thankfully none of the Guardians actually pass but they do split in an emotional finale. Star-Lord finally decides to stop running & returns home to Earth to see his grand father! The final dance scene was so enjoyable. There are two post credit scenes so make sure to say to the end!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dstan-71445","29 May 2023","Jesus wept! Why? Why does Marvel feel the need to shove it's tasteless humor in everything? Why not spare the only franchise ,that still had a soul left, from all the cheesiness and vapidness Marvel is lambasted for? Worst one of the trilogy if I am to be honest.Sitting through, my rating for the movie kept on dwindling and I reached a point where I was eager for it to end. GOTG 3 flaws were egregious. Compared to Marvel's recent releases this one is at least watchable but parallel to the series's prior movies, it's horrendous.Let's start with the humor. Part 1 had witty, timely, germane lines that would crack you up. Second one had some marvel goofiness but the engaging drama it had balanced it out. This one is chock-full of lazy, unfunny, kiddish and annoying lines meant to be amusing. Filled to the brim with marvel style goofiness which kept clashing with the gloomy story they were trying to tell. The first one was perfect without trying to appease the under 10 crowd with puerile humor.Drax is a great example. On the first one, he was a furious soul looking to avenge his massacred family but also a bit odd, nescient and irrational. Second movie made him slightly clownish but his grim soul and character was intact. Here, he's a buffon. A jester for pleasing the gang and amusing kids. Stripped of all his deep background and essence, he's merely the original character I knew and loved. An insult to fans, what they did to his character.The hella dragged out story was not engaging in the least. Rocket, my favorite character, was shorn of all his charm and made to sit this one out. He was replaced by none other than Mantis, the goofiest of all, chosen to entertain the kiddos. She kinda reminds me of my kindergarten teacher with the way she acts. Her silliness was endurable on the 2nd one cause there was some drama attached to her with Ego and all, but here she gets the most runtime and Gawd she's obnoxious.The oversentimental animal scenes were extremely cringe and cheesy. We don't know the characters so expecting us to sympathize for them cause they have big, puppy eyes is very lazy. The lines exchanged were very tacky and sitting through those was the hardest. Quill reminiscing about Gamora was heart wrenching because their relationship was well developed and we already are familiar with the characters. I can't say the same for Rocket's friends.( Also, Rocket's craftsmanship was gained through experience, not innate skill. Him being gifted felt like a retcon ).Chukwudi Iwuji as High Evolutionary did emote well and definitely is a more interesting villain than Jonathan Majors. Nevertheless, his character's motivation and goal was vague ( Making perfect beings, but how perfect? ) and he was too powerful. A villain deemed a God killed by stab to the heart. How pathetic! Same as Wanda, he was built up as an invincible demigod but perished in the most dissatisfying fashion.The screenplay was full of tired, generic lines and the CGI and costume was mostly bad. Honey I shrunk the kids level. All our main characters seem tired and worn out. Some scenes and lines were repeated from the earlier works. The music wasn't as catchy as the prior ones, as if they exhausted their playlist. 2 hrs was enough to tell the story they felt like telling. Riding out the whole thing was not a delight, I tell you.Adam Warlock was unnecessary and did not help in developing the story in any manner. The sequel and spin-off baiting finale where all the characters depart for no reason but to wander on to their own respective shows sealed it for me. At that point, I decided this flick deserves nothing but a 1/10. I genuinely feel distraught Marvel's formulaicness and childishness got to my favorite flick.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","JoshuaMercott","28 July 2023","Exploring Rocket Raccoon's origin story let ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" give one of its most famous characters well-deserved and heartfelt attention.Technically, this is a story forty years in the making. Because Rocket's first entry goes back to the Marvel Preview #7 comic book titled ""The Sword in the Star"". There have since been several other comic books that delved into this character's life and times, capturing his badassery and charisma.In ""Vol. 3"" James Gunn gave us a powerful and profound plotline, blessed with more than a few endearing moments and regaling soundtracks.It was also nice to see Gamora in a partially negative role, and not to forget Sylvester Stallone (as Stakar Ogord). In this timeline (emphasis on the word), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana) was no longer with the titular Guardians. She was brought back following the undoing of Thanos's work after ""Infinity War"". But she was back to being a ruthless Ravager with no memory of her connection to Peter and the Guardians.Meanwhile Peter Quill, after a period of drunken love-lorn mourning, found himself gathering the Guardians and embarking on a timed mission to save Rocket's life or risk losing his friend forever.Next, everything about Adam Warlock (played by Will Poulter) - one of the villains at the heart of this movie - was both exciting and hilarious. He and Rocket had something in common, especially the fact that they were both genetically engineered beings. This made Rocket 'proprietary technology' (i.e., Subject 89P13) and the High Evolutionary, working under Oracle Corporation, sent Adam to collect.With his ability to manipulate energy and matter, the 'Cosmic Crusader' was given an amazing live-action spin in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". His first comic-book entry was in ""Fantastic Four #66"" (published, 1967) and he's appeared in several stories since.I wish they found someone who looked more like the Adam Warlock from the comics, but Poulter's acting chops were more than adequate compensation. Besides, he gradually became a force to reckon with in the comics. Here in the movie, the character was just getting started. Hence his silly-funny 'newborn' incompetence.The big-bad in ""Vol. 3"" was the High Evolutionary. In keeping with his trail of destruction in comic-book lore, the 'mad geneticist' continued to be a devastating player in the movie. He broke more than just innocent bodies with his sick and unethical experiments, he also traumatized their souls. Chukwudi Iwuji's riveting performance will not soon be forgotten.On a lighter note, the movie contained a good amount of humor and hilarity. Drax, Mantis, Nebula, and Star Lord's comedic timing was *chef's kiss*. Rocket Raccoon typically delivered the punchlines, but in this movie he had more dark and poignant moments than funny ones. I loved the way they balanced it all without compromising characterization value.Everything about Counter-Earth was cleverly conceived and crafted. It evoked dark memories of what I'd seen in the 1996 movie ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" (based on the novel by H. G. Wells).The way Adam Warlock later turned good and helped save Peter Quill was a major highlight. Groot contributed some captivating moments as well. Most of the jokes in the movie were laugh-out-loud funny and the plot lingered in memory even after the end credits rolled.Finally, the sheer empathy they wove around Rocket Raccoon in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" was nothing short of masterful. Needless to say, James Gunn certainly has the Midas touch.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","851222","6 May 2023","Greetings from Lithuania.""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume"" 3 did not felt anything different from last movies made by Marvel - it's running time felt to long, it was overstuffed with plots, and homour was in its most scenes. I loved the first movie because it was so unique and fun, but this one while OK film to see it once didn't left me impressed. There was a great segments involving Rockets past (no spoilers), and i liked the villain for the most part, but sometimes less is better, and for this movie more tight plot could worked better.Overall, 3rd part was better for me then the 2nd one, but felt short from how good the first movie was. An enjoyable movie to see it once but nothing more.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","untilnow99","9 September 2023","The message regarding the cruelty and suffering of lab animals is loud and clear in this movie. As a decades-long animal rights activist, I really appreciate the educational merits of including that content in a blockbuster movie. Thank you, writers, for that.I loved the first two Guardians of the Galaxy installments and have seen them each at least a few times. This one, though? All throughout viewing this, all I could think was: ""Well . . . I can't see myself ever watching this again.""As other reviewers have pointed out, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 lacks the luster and humor of the first two movies. Sure, there are loads of terrifically innovative aliens in this one. Lots of action. A great deal of character exposition and the truly heartfelt theme re: how The Guardians have all learned to love and respect one another.That said, I had a real problem with certain aspects. Remember the ""Tell"" in Mad Max 2, where all the little kids are gathered and the story is told, in a background of glimmering firelight, of how the adults left all the kids behind? A sort of modern day take on Aboriginal ""dreaming"" and storytelling/lore. I always hated that part of the MM movies. Really cringe-worthy. Feral kid and all of that. Gag.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 introduces a slew of tow-headed children into the story and . . . I'm guessing the writers thought this would make the movie more appealing to kids and parents with kids? All I know is ---- ugh. Just seemed to be stuck in there, plot-wise, and to serve no purpose whatsoever. Joob joob. Weren't the Ewoks saying that in some Star Wars flick?And the cosmonaut dog was just plain lame. The only good thing about that character was how it showed people that calling their dog a ""bad dog"" isn't a nice way to treat your dog. (Always praise your dog, at every opportunity.)Okay. I'll stop now. I'm severely disappointed in this movie. And I did look up those insane tweets that James Gunn posted. Hollywood certainly can be forgiving. That dude is one creepy guy.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ethanbresnett","3 May 2023","I think it's fair to say that since Endgame Marvel's output has been littered with as many misses as hits. After the thoroughly disappointing Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and James Gunn well and truly delivers with Guardians Vol. 3.This is easily the most fun I've had with a superhero film in a long time. It is funny, thrilling, and surprisingly emotional. Fans who have been following these characters for the last 10 years, get ready for such a satisfying and emotional journey.What makes the Guardians so good is that they stand out. Superhero films are becoming far too formulaic and blending into one another, but the Guardians films somehow manage to buck this trend. Sure, the story follows the well trodden superhero film structure at its core and there are lots of familiar cliches and tropes, but the dressing around these things feels vibrant, distinct, and cared for.The characters remain unique and interesting, with great performances behind them all. I was particularly impressed with Pom Klementieff in this film, who steals the show in my opinion with her emotion and humour. All of the performances are great though, with another shout out to Chukwudi Iwuji for a captivating performance.The story is full of emotion, and is quite possibly the most emotional and punchy Marvel film yet. It brought me to tears and I could hear plenty of others in the theatre feeling a similar way! It's also really funny too with so many laugh out loud moments. James Gunn excelled himself with this script in every way.Saying that, I do think some story elements feel a little bit clunky, and some characters are a little surplus to requirements, but these are minor criticisms in the grand scheme of things.The action sequences are well done. They aren't mind blowing, but much more emphasis is put into story and character than action so this isn't necessarily a bad thing.I will also say that despite being two and a half hours this film doesn't feel long at all. It never once drags and every scene feels needed and adds something to the whole picture.Guardians Vol 3. Is fun, emotional, and just a joy to watch. A brilliant return to form for the MCU.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","PartialMovieViewer","11 June 2023","Split story - story 1: hard to follow and/or care about either. Grown-up Rocket is excellent - while the garbage, tear jerky garbage about the character, stank and drawn out. Where were the writers, editors and director? Story 2: special affects and CGI were the overacted stars in this one. The rare good and funny moments the key heroes interacted were way too sparse. I got exhausted watching and listening to pointless explosions, ugliest aliens and stars plugged in for no apparent reason. Love Nathan Fillion, but his talents were wasted on such a useless character.Bad: way too long, story and plot were omitted, good writing mixed with horrible writing, not enough interaction between key characters and worst, way too much CGI. Also - music? Soundtrack? What was that song? There was so many artists from the 70s and 80s to chose from - and second rate dribble was selected. Painfully too loud. And Groot has spent too long at the gym.Good: as much as I will miss these main stars in these rolls, they're gone. Chris Pratt is great along with the others. Nice sign-off. The first movie screamed for a sequel and the 2nd was good - not near as great as the first - but good...and another sequel was needed. After seeing this one, the second one should have been the end.Please. No more GOTG.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","fernandoschiavi","10 January 2024","If someone talked about Guardians of the Galaxy in 2013, it is certain that very few people would know how to describe this group of heroes. Released in 2014, the first Guardians was the film fans needed, at the right time. Who would have thought that a tree, a raccoon, a daughter of Thanos, a looter and a vengeful father would dictate the tone of team-up films for years to come, and become part of pop culture history once and for all. Now, almost a decade after that beginning, the story of the most misfit characters in the galaxy comes to an end with a bang. Without further ado, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 3"" is a work with soul, charisma, personality and love. It's a film that closes arcs and consolidates that team as the most important after the Avengers.Proposed as the last part of a trilogy, ""Volume 3"" comes to close the Guardians of the Galaxy Trilogy in a more than worthy way, delivering the arc closures that each of its components deserved, including Gamora from another universe (Zoe Saldana). While the film itself has its stumbles, almost all of them due to the typically Hollywood bloat of Gunn's script, it is clearly noticeable the filmmaker's affection for the characters he made popular by inserting his brand of playful humor and lots of music into the film's DNA. His (re)creations, as he tries his best to dedicate this second sequel to each of them almost equally, from Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) to Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), through Drax (Dave Bautista), Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and Groot (Vin Diesel) and reaching Nebula (Karen Gillan) who has her participation and importance greatly expanded. Even Cosmo (Maria Bakalova), included in the ""Holiday Special"" to more directly pay homage to the dog Laika on whom the original character was based) and Kraglin Obfonteri (Sean Gunn) have great space in the film to show their value.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes it easy to ignore its missteps thanks to its huge setbacks. Aware of what the public expects from a group adventure, James Gunn brings back the renowned mix of superhero, science fiction and comedy with touches of nostalgia. A formula improved throughout the trilogy and which reaches its peak here. The first proof that the film hits the target is in the evolution of its characters. Unlike other Marvel heroes, who seem to regress with each film, each member of the team carries with them the growth acquired throughout the journey. A rewarding feeling that enhances the experience by valuing the background of the characters and the audience that has followed them for years. It's a relief to see the maturation of names like Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), who could easily go through the entire MCU following the basic characteristics of when they were introduced. The same happens to Groot (Vin Diesel), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), who develop new characteristics without abandoning the comic relief. Even Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who has a plausible reason to regress, brings a complexity that avoids the taste for repetition.The evolution of the characters is accompanied by the growth in the scope of the production - something that seemed unlikely considering that the Guardians' setting is literally the Galaxy. In his last round with the characters, Gunn commands each sequence with as much excitement as possible, using different tools to keep the viewer involved, dazzled and surprised. Sometimes all of this together. Not surprisingly, the director makes the bold decision to treat ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" as a true biblical epic. There is a constant feeling that the characters are dealing with things larger than life, including events that make direct parallels with Christian scriptures without sounding corny. An approach that highlights the grandeur with which the director sees the work and that makes perfect sense with the film's major conflict: the confrontation with the creator himself.Although Gunn maintains his comedic signature, the backdrop of the third ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" film is the darkest and most sinister of all, as Rocket's past, seen in the character's memories and hallucinations, is a horror festival with extremely cruel experiments on animals at the hands of a villain obsessed with creating the perfect breed, a true space Dr. Moureau. In fact, Dr. Moureau is not enough to characterize the insane character that Iwuji embodies in a frightening way, varying between glassy eyes and complete insanity, as he is more like an animal Dr. Mengele, a monster capable of anything to, in fact, his crazy head, acting as God. If the MCU has largely always failed its villains, here Gunn sculpts an irredeemable figure, someone who anyone would be very happy to slaughter and who the script, unlike the current irritating craze, doesn't dedicate a single piece of dialogue to creating an ""explanation"". For him to be as he is. It is evil in its pure form, with no greater plans than those dictated by his horrible and perverse obsession, something that works especially well considering that the central theme of the film is, as cliché as it may sound, the love we feel for the members of our family, whether by blood or by the one we choose to belong to.While the big villain really deserves all our anger, the variety of settings and creatures - something not exactly uncommon in the Guardians of the Galaxy films - deserves all the praise, especially as it is even greater here. Not only Knowhere, which appears only at the beginning and at the end, comes to life under the ""government"" of the Guardians, with streets, alleys and a thriving population that convinces even knowing that it is inside the basically rotting skull of a Celestial, but the other scenarios are also worth taking off your hat. There is the aforementioned space mega-laboratory that is ""built"" from living mass and, therefore, is basically just disgusting, giving a thousand opportunities to designers who opted for a bizarr* kits*h approach; there is Counter-Earth and its population of animals genetically and cybernetically altered by the High Evolutionary, with the prosthetics, makeup and practical effects team probably having to work more than 24 hours a day to create what we see on the big screen and there is, finally , the villain's ship which, despite being the typical ""bandit headquarters"", with even a color palette that doesn't allow us to forget that for a second, gains extra layers for also being a horrible laboratory prison where he carries out his experiments on living beings, basically Dr. Moreau's island or, of course, Dr. Mengele's extermination camp.Even though it doesn't forcefully open spaces for the entry of other figures from the Marvel Universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" certainly takes a step towards the future. Furthermore, the threat is not a being with unimaginable powers that can decimate part of the galaxy with the snap of a finger or someone with the ability to freely move through the multiverse. In this third solo adventure of the Guardians of the Galaxy, the enemy symbolizes the barrier to be overcome for the new hero to rise to protagonism. There is a psychoanalytic aspect to this idea of a ""son"" subjugating the oppressive figure of the ""father"" in search of emancipation. Therefore, Rocket is placed against a recent trend at Marvel, that of elaborating on the emotional and psychological maturation of superheroes through fatherhood. He is the creation, the creature that needs to rebel against the purposes of the crazy replica of Dr. Frankenstein in order to step out of the shadow and take his rightful place in the sun. But, before the warrior raccoon rises up and takes up arms, we have good doses of action packed with a very special soundtrack and recurring jokes with the characters' weaknesses. Quill meets Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Nebula (Karen Gillan) seems jealous, Drax (Dave Bautista) remains clueless and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) gains deserved prominence. James Gunn's irreverent touch continues to work.It doesn't take long to realize that Marvel's newest feature film is a watershed in the group's history. Especially in the third act, death and separation are constant elements. Still within the personality imprinted by James Gunn in a calculated universe so prone to standardization, the digital effects are well combined with the practical ones in order to not leave the feeling of a textured screen in the scenarios and fights. The action appears to offer catharsis in circumstances in which we are called upon to root for redemptions, comebacks and the unlikely victory of the misfits over the figure who claims the right to sit on the throne destined for divinities. This ""Vol. 3"" does not present anything so new, as its guiding principle is to maintain the coherence established by the two features that preceded it. Including the communist bi*ch boosted by telekinetic powers (she could be better used in the plot), the film emphasizes friendship as fundamental to the Guardians' success. Resonating something from Rocket's sad past, James Gunn defends the idea that family is what welcomes and supports us, not necessarily the other branches and roots of our family tree.Navigating between comedy, action and even horror, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" presents its final card: emotion. Doing justice to the franchise, which is full of simple and moving moments, the final chapter is not far behind. Despite following a path that occasionally borders on the appealing in terms of suffering, the narrative builds moments of genuine emotion. A commotion that varies with the level of attachment to the characters, but that can easily bring tears. It is with this mixture that the Guardians of the Galaxy - at least this version of the team - say goodbye to the Marvel universe.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","averagedeveloper","31 January 2024","It is obvious that mcu has gone downhill and made a mess of things as it entered the series period after Endgame. They completely ruined the multiverse fiction that they tried to put at the center in the new phase. The accusations against the actor who played the main villain of the new phase were the last nail in the coffin of that long-running fiction structure of the mcu. What saved this movie was that it told an independent story without getting involved in all of this. And achive to make good use of one of the most interesting villains they have.The movie looks very good visually and the actors do their part very well. That is given. They were always successful visually and in casting good actors. They handled a subject that touches the soft spot of people who sensitive about animal testing and ethics very well, with a villain in a comic book style that suits them. It's very clearly a children's movie. This is a genre and it does not mean that the movie is bad or only children should watch it. As a 30-year-old adult, I watched the movie with pleasure, looking forward to our heroes defeating the bad guy and kicking his ass.","

I thought rocket's story worked really well, and got me a bit tearful in places.But Will Pouter? I liked where he started and where he ended, but the whole middle seemed to be missing. I liked that people got to see more in Drax even if he didn't see more in himself.Despite being over 2.5 hours long, it didn't feel like it overstayed it's welcome. 1
You know, there was enough good stuff to make it worthwhile, but you did have to ignore the missing beats in a lot of the subplots.Overall, I thought it was like that one good song on an album by a band in a slump that's not as good as there best stuff but is just about good enough to make you think they still have something going on.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sevskirita","30 October 2023","This series has long been centered around the theme of not running away from your pain, and this movie continues this but also sets focus on the theme of not just facing your pain but actively repairing it.Peter and Rocket both run for the comfort of other people, creating negative circumstances like Peter vying for a woman who will not love him. The antagonist also plays on this theme, torching every mistake he makes in the comforting hope of an impossible future.Paired with things like animal experimentation, Quill's lost girlfriend, etc., it is very similar to Guardians of the Galaxy 1. And much like that first movie, its execution fumbles the story and emotional potential.However, whereas GotG 1 had its potential undercut by larger problems, such as an over reliance on flat exposition, this movie's problems are more subtle and don't have an easy common thread to generalize the problem with the movie.One of the earliest off-beats I noticed was when Nebula witnesses Rocket's origin. It's pretty profound and inspired to have one victim of cybernetic torture witness their friend's hidden past of being cybernetically experimented on. In theory it makes for a great scene, but it is weirdly undercut by Nebula one-upping her own pain by saying Rocket's was worse.Firstly, how?? Rocket is mostly bodily intact, and the experiments done on him we're not intended for deliberate punishment and torture like Nebula's was. Nebula's anatomy is much more grotesque and implied to be extensively manipulated down to her mind and bones, whereas Rocket's seem less deep.Secondly, this is an opportunity to establish an emotional connection between Nebula and Rocket, clumsily using it to say Rocket's pain is worse breaks that connection and implies that the torture hasn't been adequately shown to the audience and has to be told to us. Weird.The second thing that threw me off was the implied existence of God during the Rocket Heaven scene. I understand that there being a happy afterlife poses a considerably better way to look at Batch 89's deaths, but I can't say how odd it comes in such a secular universe. I'm an atheist so I'm not sure I would ever find this compelling, but I do think I would have been less blindsided and more able to appreciate the moment had the theme of there being an actual God been developed.Much of the finale threw me off in fact. One of the biggest things was all the side character plot resolutions. Themes like being a follower vs being who you want to be were never really explored with Mantis until the very last second. Or Kraglin and not listening to his heart.There was also weird missed opportunities, like no child coming up to hold Drax's hand as Mantis leaves, showing how the temporary hole his friend leaves can be filled by being a good role model to the next generation. Also I can't really track what the whole ""dancing is for idiots"" thing was about and why Drax danced at the end. What was the thematic conflict going on there?And finally, Peter expecting to only save the ""higher life forms"" is a really odd moment. This valuing one life over another thing is never really developed as a trait in the rest of the Guardians, but suddenly it's implied that Peter did have this value and it's immediately resolved by Peter and the Guardians helping Rocket save a bunch of animals.Although this feels like a pretty big thematic gap in Rocket and Peter's stories, otherwise they are done pretty perfectly in comparison to the rest. Peter's arc about not using crutches in life and repairing his past is executed with no falter, and Rocket's acceptance of his past and righting the wrongs done to him felt very fulfilling (aside from the aforementioned sudden theology insertion and the weird incomplete resolution of his loneliness with the Guardians half broken up at the end). Rocket's is probably one of my favorite in fiction.So I do think this movie is kinda overrated. The idea of it really is great and explains why people like it, but being attentive clues you into some big thematic and execution issues that make the emotional moments feel a bit off and less than you were expecting. I'd give the movie a 8/10 for being pretty emotionally compelling and funny but ultimately having some large hidden issues and execution problems.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Barbouzes","22 May 2023","The first GOTG was fun and fresh: loved the humour and the banter between the insane characters. In this 3rd installment, the raccoon was doing the best acting...and yet he is a CGI puppet!!! Need I say more? His backstory was compelling and well brought on, although certainly and forcefully designed to bring on tears. I was surprised to hear kids in the theater where I saw the movie: this film is dark in substance, amazingly violent, sometime disturbing (the mangled animals -as CGI as they were-, distressed me greatly) and the many scenes of ""friendly"" characters screaming at each other instead of having a conversation, far from being humorous, were tedious and upsetting. In short, it is too violent for children, and the plot is too childish for adults. Time to retire the series. Enough with the green screen and the galactic universes with guns and a thousand explosions. Bring on real writers and real characters.","

NO REDEMING QUALITIES WHATSOEVER ... AN INSULT TO THE WORK OF ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE FIRST TWO FILMS ... FLUSH IT ... ITS POO.","

The movie was just so beautiful is so many ways!! All the characters shined and got equal screen time, really showed them all as an equal team! The story was touching and meaningful, the performance from the entire cast were phenomenal, a certain scene with Pratt broke my heart because he delivered an amazing nuanced performance, same with the rest of the cast, they all delivered amazing performances in regards to emotional scenes, action and comedy!! The cinematography and music were excellent!! So glad James Gunn returned to direct it. I'm going to miss the Guardians and this incredible cast so much!!!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","simplygk","3 May 2023","9 years, 6 movies and one special presentation later... its time to say goodbye to our guardians. The movie was done in typical Guardians style with some kick ass tunes and plenty of laughs but this movie had so much more heart than the previous 2 titles. The story mainly focuses on Rockets backstory, which is absolutely tragic and heartbreaking. The only disappointing thing was Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, he was powerful enough but portrayed as a child and kind of stupid... basically like drax, but less funny. If ypu enjoyed the previous 2 guardians movies then I highly recommend you go check this out. Definitely one of the better MCU movies since Endgame.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","destinychild2014","12 September 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy 3 isn't just the best Marvel movie for me, but my No 1 movie ever, dethroning Drive from that spot. The reason? Rocket...Rocket is my favorite character ever because he is me (and also more adorable, more smart and more couragious, I'm not any of those things).He is me though because I'm a misunderstood little man that pushes everyone away, being a jerk and a smartass to most people because i don't want to experience loosing my friends and being left alone, outcasted by everyone because I'm different, weird and unfitting as it happened on my childhood...And what happens to Rocket in this trilogy is my ultimate fantasy. Finding people who slowly will love me so much that are able to sacrifice everything for me as i would do for them. Almost impossible in real life but having 3 movies (more if you count the Avengers movies that the guardians take part) that portrayed my fantasy it's just the recipe for the ultimate entertainment package. (Plus triple the action, the jokes and drama from the other movies).So i have to thank with all my heart all the cast and crew (maybe James Gunn a bit more then any other) for creating something that i can rewatch a million times and hope that in a galaxy far far a way, an alternative me had experienced the love and recognition that Rockets has in this marvelous trilogy...Thank you all...PS for Marvel: Take an example, Marvel Studios and follow through this masterpiece and you'll be able to fix any problem you have after the mediocre Phase 4 and on...","

As you'd expect, there's overwhelming CGI, with conjured creatures of magnificence and style, cast from the past, is reconvened, chasing down almighty fiend, a new hero is a dog, who can defy. After Ant Man (3) this is so much more engaging, you will not leave the screen annoyed and slightly raging, in fact you may just shed a tear, with a story to endear, as those trapped behind locked doors, are freed from cages.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","marcinpietrzyk-74214","21 May 2023","Marvel seems to be making contest for the ugliest world created in its movies. The world in the latest Ant Man looks like fungus under the microscope. While the world in this one is full of weird creatures that look like they were taken from this H. G. Wells book 'The Island of Dr Moreau'. The movie is weak. Definitely the weakest of all three Guardians of Galaxy movies. I guess it was supposed to be emotional. But it's not. It fails even there, because all these creatures are so grotesque. It still has good music though, but that's the only plus I can think of. Also, why is Gamora even there? She died god damn it. But sure, in sci - fi it's not a problem, let's just tell the viewers that the new Gamora is from the parallel universe. Of course I have nothing against Zoe Saldana. She's incredibly talented and so cute. But she shouldn't be there.And of course this overblown 8,3 rating. No this, movie is not 8,3. It's not even 3. I don't know what is happening with Marvel but still not even one good movie since Avengers Infinity War / Endgame.","

After far too many heartless, dull, pointless MCU projects that followed End Game, it was so nice to FEEL SOMETHING again while watching a Marvel movie. To feel the emotion behind the characters and the purpose of the story.Guardians rounds out as the strongest overall trilogy of the MCU. The ending was beautiful and poignant, capping off an amazing run for the protectors of outer space.This movie was able to be visually dazzling with CGI and effects, but avoid th recent pitfall of letting those things be the bulk of a movie. They're merely background; a means to tell a great story. The way, I feel, it should be.Thank you, James Gunn (and crew)!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","masonsaul","3 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 delivers all the humour and inventive action you expect but is at its strongest when exploring its darkest moments, offering an emotionally satisfying goodbye to the best family in the MCU as they all face the music and finally confront their trauma. It also feels like a vital piece of unchecked creativity in a cinematic universe growing increasingly stale.The Guardians films have always stood out within the greater Marvel universe but after the hit and miss nature of phase 4 and phase 5 getting off to a terrible start with Quantumania, it's honestly kinda baffling that this beautiful, proactive and personal movie is even remotely linked to all of that.Chris Pratt is just as strong as before as Peter Quill, there's always been a sadness beneath the charming exterior but after all the previous losses its starting to come to the surface in terrific fashion as he's determined to protect his family this time around. Zoe Saldaña's performance is a lot different to what's come before, giving this version of Gamora a fresh personality and relationship with the other Guardians.Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the emotional core of this one, so much time is spent exploring his past and it leads to the most emotionally devastating moments and he absolutely brings it. Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff remain really funny throughout but the film wisely still takes time to offer reminders of their dramatic chops as well.Karen Gillan has only gotten better with each film and gets the most to do in this one. Seeing her grow from antagonist to equal has been one of the biggest and best surprises of the trilogy. Chukwudi Iwuji is an amazing villain, eschewing the usual tortured past of most villains for a character who is just plain evil and larger than life, played to perfection.James Gunn's direction is incredible. He's clearly pushing himself creatively, technically and emotionally throughout to deliver the swansong these characters deserve and its so satisfying to watch. There's also a hallway fight done all in one take that's just one of the most thrilling things in the entirety of the MCU.Definitely worthy of the mention is the CG, which is surprisingly good. Recently that has been on a major downward spiral for which Marvel can only blame themselves for their unreasonable deadlines and inability to plan. Which is why its so nice to see one of these where it looks good throughout, emphasising what can be achieved when these actually have a visionary with a plan.Finally, the music by John Murphy shares more stylistically with The Suicide Squad opposed to Tyler Bates work on the previous 2 but it still remembers to use that iconic theme at the right moment and Awesome Mix - Vol 3 is excellent. No longer focusing on a single decade it creates something much more wild and unique.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","renegadeviking-271-528568","27 July 2023","Marvel's oddball superhero team are back in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, and this time writer-director James Gunn goes for broke with an action packed spectacular that's rich with emotional depth. It also sets in motion a reasonably satisfying finale for these fan-favourite characters who we have grown to know and love over their many appearances in the MCU. This blockbusting sequel catches up with the Guardians who have made their new HQ in the rebuilt Kowhere, a huge mining facility built inside a Celestial's skull. Unusually, the film initially quite a somber tone, as some of the Guardians are in a somewhat reflective mood. The Guardians, comprising of : Peter Quill, otherwise known as Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), an easy-going manchild obsessed by rock and pop anthems, the tough taking racoon, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Gamora (Zoe Saldaña) the green-skinned assassin, her cyborg sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), the lovable walking tree Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), the humourless warrior Drax (Dave Bautista), and the empathic Mantis (Pom Klementieff) are all back for James Gunn's MCU swan song to round off the Guardians trilogy in fine style.The melancholy is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Adam Warlock (Will Poulter , a super buff golden assassin. His brutal attack is eventually repelled by the Guardians, but not before Rocket has been fatally wounded. After discovering Rocket has a kill switch in his chest that prevents him from undergoing life saving surgery, the Guardians have no choice but to embark on a dangerous heist mission, along with The Ravagers and a reluctant Gamora, to steal a code from a biotech company. If that wasn't enough for them to contend with they will also have to confront the powerful High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Lwuji), who originally created Rocked as part of his scheme to genetically engineer a master race.The ensemble cast are all on especially fine for throughout. Each have made their roles their own now, the team dynamic of the Guardians is a joy to watch, and the humour comes thick and fast as well. James Gunn has clearly been given free reign to do whatever he wants with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, there's so much crammed in its a little overwhelming at times, but the fun and spectacle of it all is truly breathtaking. It's not all interstellar high jinks though, Gunn puts Star-Lord and Rocket through the emotional wringer. Peter is pining for the loss of his soulmate Gamora who died in Avengers Infinity War, adding insult to injury, he now has to cope with the face she's been replaced by the alternative timeline version of Gamora from Endgame who doesn't love him. Meanwhile, the emotional heart of the film comes from the disturbing flashbacks exploring Rockets origins which highlight the terrible trauma and circumstances that made him into a the kick-ass raccoon we know today. Rocket's origin story is a harrowing and deeply emotional journey to witness as it unfolds, and its is this powerful underlying narrative that really drives the plot.With its frenetic action, amazing special effects, and great soundtrack Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is everything fans could've hoped for and then some. Sure, the plot dose't always quite hold together as well as it could've and the third act drags a little bit, but James Gunn has still managed to skilfully dodge the pitfalls of the threquill to deliver a fitting finale and entertaining intergalactic adventure on the wackier side of the MCU!","

It is rare for a superhero movie to make you think about your life and choices quite like this one!The movie also had its darker moments which i think suited the movie and made it a more mature experience while still making it fun and lighthearted and keeping the overall Guardians charm!James Gunn delivers an unforgetable, thoughtprovoking, emotional last ride with The Guardians that will stick with you!Superhero movies can still be great!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","boblipton","7 May 2023","It starts with one of those free-for-all battles in which Rocket J. Squirrel.... I mean Raccoon is badly injured. When they try to fix him using high tech, it turns out that they need to get a special computer key, otherwise he'll die. So we alternate between part of his origin story -- although not how he picked up that old-line Bensonhurst accent -- and the various characters in the franchise doing stuff, slanging each other, for 130 minutes. Chukwudi Iwuji is the big villain, who starts off sounding like a high-minded fellow, conducting interesting experiments in eugenics, although by the end we can be sure he'll be just another loon who needs to be shredded into little pieces so that cute little girls can be safe.We also get a sense that this phase of the Guardians is at an end, with several of them going off to do their own things, while Rocket works with a revised team who haven't heard all his wisecracks before. It's a satisfying conclusion to this phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with what my cousin assures me is a good selection of pop music from the 1980s through 2010. For those who care about such things, Nathan Fillion has a nice small role, and his TV daughter from CASTLE, Molly C. Quinn, plays one of the Ravagers.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Pjtaylor-96-138044","14 May 2023","I was expecting - or, should I say, hoping - that 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' would be good, primarily because 'Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014)' is my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie by quite a wide margin and 'Guardians Of The Galaxy: Vol. 2 (2017)' is also great. However, after the solid but not spectacular 'The Guardians Of The Galaxy: Holiday Special (2022)' and the general lacklustre nature of the MCU's fourth phase, I certainly had my doubts. Not that I thought this series finale would be bad, per se, just that I had tempered my expectations and didn't expect it to be something truly special.But, boy, was I wrong. I'm glad to say that 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' puts every single one of Marvel's post-'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' efforts, even the good ones (with the possible exception of 'Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)'), to shame. It positively blows them out of the water and, in fact, it's easily the MCU's best movie since the original 'Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014)'. James Gunn once again proves that character is king, delivering an experience that prioritises emotional growth and interpersonal dynamics over all else. His picture is surprisingly dark from the moment it begins, delving into the traumatic origins of its most interesting character in a number of genuinely upsetting sequences. I'd heard this piece packed an emotional punch and the previous two entries certainly had their tearjerker moments, but my goodness this hit hard. Be sure to bring the tissues because there are a number of moments that may just necessitate their use. It's a truly affecting experience. The excellent characters and their evolving relationships are the bedrock of the affair, which is mature and sincere throughout. Although its tone is relatively downbeat, the series' signature humour is still present. While some of it feels a little out of place, its inclusion is always appreciated. Not only is it often funny, it also signifies that the comedy is a crucial part of the character work; these people can't just turn off their personalities when the going gets tough.Despite its inherent darkness, the feature is still a ton of fun when it needs to be and includes a number of fantastic set-pieces that put a smile on your face. The action is exciting, energetic and expert crafted. There's a one-take sequence in the third act that's absolutely phenomenal, easily one of the - if not the - best action scenes in the entire franchise. The picture also looks great, with vibrant cinematography and a solid mix of practical and visual effects. It never feels like the actors are just standing on a blue/green screen set, even though they clearly often are, and the CGI is actually really convincing, almost like the the effects houses had enough time to properly do their work. Basically, it feels like a real movie, with purposeful shot composition and considered blocking. This really is a miracle given Marvel's reputation for rushing and generally mistreating those doing the legwork in creating their fantasy worlds, which - in combination with some lacklustre cinematography - has resulted in their recent efforts being hampered by some truly awful aesthetics.Another element that enhances Gunn's film is its enthusiastic acting, which is honestly really good across the board. There's no sleepwalking John Krasinski's here, that's for sure. The brilliant writing makes sure that pretty much everyone gets quite a bit to chew on and they all chew it exactly the right amount. Their convincing, often moving work adds believability to each and every moment, no matter how wonderfully outlandish it may. They all strike the perfect balance between humour and heart, reflecting the screenplay's own prowess in that department. This entry is arguably the most sincere in its series. Though the prior entries certainly have genuine heart to them, this one seems to wear it on its sleeve just a little more. Its occasional bluntness doesn't dampen its effect, though, because the piece never feels cheap or manipulative. It seems to honesty believe what it ultimately preaches, building upon the warmth the audience already has towards its key players to deliver a powerful finale that wraps everything up almost perfectly.Although the plotting is a little messy, the flick flows nicely and there's never a dull moment. It's arguably slightly too long, but it makes good use of its runtime and is constantly engaging. The villain is seriously menacing, one of the best antagonists in the MCU not for the complexity of his motivation, but for the vicious single-mindedness of his cruelty. The stakes are arguably the smallest in the series, but that's kind of what makes them the most impactful; for most of the movie, they're entirely personal and focused on the survival of a single character. The narrative goes in somewhat of an unexpected direction, yet remains satisfying throughout by leaning into its unconventional elements and providing a powerful look into events previously only alluded to. It's really compelling overall.In the end, this is an absolutely amazing film. Thanks to its unrivalled character work, effective humour, unflinching darkness, spectacular spectacle, energetic action and impressive aesthetic, it stands head and shoulders above most of the MCU and basically hammers the final nail in the coffin of movies like 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022)' and 'Thor: Love And Thunder (2022)'. This is what happens when you hire a filmmaker and actually let them make the film they want to make. Kevin Feige really should take notes. Emotion and character are the key to good stories; it's a shame Marvel seems to have forgotten that. 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' is honestly one of the best superhero movies ever made. Given its recent disappointments, I didn't think I'd be saying that about an entry in the MCU anytime soon.","

Like a lot of fans, really felt they were losing their interest and enjoyment but of course Guardians does not disappoint.This is hands down the funniest marvel film, never laughed so much (of course it was silly at times but you'd expect that from a guardians film)
The action sequences were fantastic and the CGI was great (first time in a while for a marvel film). Music was awesome and every character had their scene and whilst I was expecting some emotional scenes based from the trailer, there were a lot more. Villain was very good too and in my opinion the best in the guardians trilogy .The only things I can criticize was the length and one particular character. Other than that this is a brilliant film and conclusion to a trilogy.Edit: upon watching it the 2nd time and in Imax I've changed my rating from a 9 to a 10. My previous negatives I retract, the length is actually fine because the pace and plot suit it. The development of a character that I didn't like, I was wrong about seeing as this time I understood what gunn was doing. This is also the first time I've ever watched a film again in the cinema and man was it worth it!","

It couldn't get out of it's own way. Somehow dark and cutesy at the same time. Adam Warlock was unnecessary to the story and poorly written. Many of the main characters are at death's door on many occasions with no consequences. Multiple fight scenes involving every character so you can't tell what's happening. Drax and Mantis' banter is mostly just obnoxious. They're like kids you just want to smack the whole time. Nebula just yells at everybody for 2 and a half hours. The High Evelutionary is way too over the top to the point where he's mostly just distracting. There were audible groans in the theater when Kraglin sees Yondu during the big battle.There were positives, too. The flashbacks of Rocket were well done and moving. The FX were mostly great. Some of the songs were great songs and fit well in the movie. Some of the banter was funny. There was just way too much.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","4 May 2023","One of the Guardians is injured, leaving the others only 48 hours to save their life.This does an amazing job capping off an excellent trilogy. James Gunn's work continues to be highly emotionally intelligent, subjecting us to scenes of cruelty not for edgelord humor, which there is still some of, no, to make it a more emotionally engaging and effective story, and to make points about trauma. Nearly every major character has an arc related to the overarching theme that pain begets more pain. If this truly is the last time we see them, at least together, it is a satisfying conclusion.Eugenics and animal testing are confronted head-on and this is a movie that will really hit you hard. The action is creative and visceral, especially the bone breaking, gory parts of it - how did this get a PG-13?! The villain is one we love to hate and we can't wait to see him be taken down. I honestly expected that I would be telling people they have to make sure to watch all the other appearances of this team in preparation, but honestly, if you pay very close attention everything that you need to know to follow it is explained.I recommend this to any fan of movies that are not afraid to get weird, dark and honest. 9/10.","

It has a great cast.But it's not great.Easily the worst GOTG movie and certainly it's a lower tier Marvel movie - I won't watch it again.It's messy, it's basic & it misuses a great cast but it's worst crime is two fold - the music doesn't work & its jokes are old. Two things which made Volumes 1 & 2 stand out are the worst things in Volume 3. I barely raised a chuckle because I'd seen & heard it all before.Yes, it pulls on the heartstrings with it's animal testing plot thread, but it feels out of place & doesn't actually let us into Rocket any deeper than we already were... especially given he's not in the movie very much at all.Unfortunately, this is pretty lame at best.

The film just became ever more ridiculous and stupid to the point where it was just plain irritating.If this is the last one in the Guardian series then it's definitely one too many.","

I found myself shedding tears rather than having the anticipated laughter. It is incomprehensible to me why someone with a disturbed mindset would deem it acceptable to repeatedly and explicitly portray such cruelty towards innocent and adorable creatures, subjecting them to painful ordeals or transforming them into grotesque monstrosities. The entirety of the movie was simply disconcerting, and I strongly caution parents and guardians to exercise extreme care if considering allowing their children to watch it. The visuals were disgustingly graphic without any discernible purpose, the narrative lacked inspiration, and this film fails to offer any redeeming qualities. I had initially been filled with excitement about seeing the movie, as the Guardians series is typically enjoyable, but my expectations were shattered, leaving me immensely disappointed.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Thecritichood234","6 October 2023","It had a basic story but the execution was fabulous, the villain was a great (finally a evil villain) the characters were all the highlight of this movie because since the first one, it has become clear that James Gunn can take lesser known characters and make them a household name and the send off is not the best but a great way to send off this franchise. The best character and the best part about this movie is rocket. The flashbacks are very interesting and compelling shows his backstory shows how the villain became how he is in this movie. Each character has moments to shine and it's very well mannered.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","davidwalker-94471","3 May 2023","Guardians is one of my favourite MCU sub-series (after Captain America) and this one lives up to the others.It's a buddy movie, an action movie, a comedy and an origin movie all in one. It's quite an emotional movie and it does feel very final in terms of the guardians we know.There's interesting development of existing characters and introduction, as is the MCU way, of yet more colourful and rich characters that comic fans will know.There's a bit of romantic will-they-won't-they. Actually there's more than a bit.It feels ever so slightly more grown up than the previous two guardians but above all, it's fun and it's a very good entry into the MCU.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TMAuthor23","16 September 2023","If you're reading this you've already invested some time (and emotion) watching the first two.As a conclusion to the original trilogy (there will be more Starlord) it does a pretty good job. The lengthy backstory and character arc for Rocket is great. Gamora's piece is good also. The evolution of Nebula continues with a new look and more sensitive outlook.The one character I didn't enjoy was Adam. If you've read the original Genesis of this character, he was never ""half-baked"" and goofy. He was more like The Silver Surfer, a demigod. Because this version of Adam is so dumb and clumsy, there's little tension in the fight scenes he's involved in except for his first appearance where we don't see him verbally engage with other characters.The weakness in the film is the extended second act. Nathan Fillion is always fun, but the antics in the organic space station go on too long. And as cute as it was, the freeing of all the children at the end felt contrived.Nonetheless, recommended for all of the above and the uplifting ending to a fun story of a band of misfits.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","neil-476","7 May 2023","The Guardians (now including Kraglin, sporting Yondu's spare head fin, but excluding Gamora, now part of the Ravagers) have no sooner set up shop - literally - in Knowhere when disaster strikes in the person of Adam Warlock, a superpowered emissary from the gold people first encountered at the start of volume 2. It turns out that Rocket is being sought by the High Evolutionary, who created him. In the course of what follows, we learn a great deal of Rocket's backstory.The first two Guardians films were cosmic science fiction with jokes, and a strong underlying thread about finding family in the most unlikely places. This third film is a different kettle of fish. It's not without humour, but it is a much darker more serious film than its predecessors. Rocket's backstory does not have the scope for humour that Quill's did.I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I should comment that there are places where it is disturbing, bordering on horrific (not in terms of graphic content).There are things vewers might expect in this film, and I wouldn't wish to spoil any details, other than to say that I'm sure James Gunn was well aware of this and concerned not to disappoint. The details may not be what you expect, though.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","benjaminskylerhill","4 May 2023","The RottenTomatoes critics' consensus laments that this final Guardians outing ""tugs too tight on the heartstrings."" I fail to see how this is a bad thing.Especially when the film's deep emotional core is rooted in a story that carries this trilogy's themes and characters to their natural conclusions. Unlike what Marvel has been churning out recently, nothing about this feels lazy or thrown together.Although this movie's villain isn't as interesting as Vol 2's Ego, he suits this story as he fits the Guardians' collective journey to embrace each others' worth and turn their trauma into an outward-facing tool to help others.James Gunn has also improved as a director, becoming adept with the action scenes; the fights and the peril here have tangible momentum and they're thrilling.It's entertaining, heartfelt, exciting, and beautiful. I adored everything about it.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","subxerogravity","5 May 2023","It was a hell of a ride, and if this is going to be the last of the GOG volumes than it was not a bad last volume. I will not lie; I could not help comparing it to the other volumes and in that comparison, I like the others better, not to say this was not highly thrilling.This volume was funny. It felt like that was the best the movie had to offer overall. Just a lot of fun rich jokes. It was strange if you think about how much it cost in special effects to make this movie and they made a movie where a lot of funny talking is happening. They gave James Gunn a lot of freedom to do some character development to the Guardians. Did we really need that? I'll just say I now see why Dave Bautista was like he did not want to be known as Drax the Destroyer for his overall acting career.The movie did have a lot of really good action scenes spread through the entire film. On one side, this film was all about the Guardians bonding, but despite how intimate that was met to be the movie felt big. Not the biggest Marvel movie I've seen but their efforts were worth seeing on the big screen.And give it up for the High Evolutionary. Don't know much about the character so I can't speak on accuracy but he was evil. I'm glad the Marvel Cinematic universe is getting better with the villains.My only real complaint was the soundtrack. Great songs overall but it did not fit into the story being told like with the other volumes.Overall, it was a good movie as far as movies go, as part of the MCU like other movies (like Ant-Man 3 which came out earlier this year) I feel the magic winding down, but so far this was the best offering for Marvel studios for 2023.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","philwicksteed","8 May 2023","This was pretty disappointing as I loved the first Guardians movie (and enjoyed the second one). It just felt like a bit of a mess, and the acting and dialogue was not as good as the earlier MCU films.Overall it was enjoyable and the 150 minutes passed relatively quickly, but way too much CGI for me and every time I started getting into it, I found myself snapped out of it by a corny line.One of the biggest issues with it is that the ""grown up"" Rocket was largely absent from the movie and instead the character appeared though a highly disturbing yet at the same time saccharine back story.Even the soundtrack seemed all over the place. It includes a couple of real gems (from Faith No More and Beastie Boys in particular) but there didn't seem to be a any time period or genre which linked all the tunes together. Maybe that's the point, but it felt a bit like Quill had left his iPod on shuffle.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cruise01","16 May 2023","5 out of 5 stars.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is an awesome superhero film that is a perfect end to the trilogy with action, emotions, and a great direction arc that concludes to the characters we love.The plot is great. It involves a bit of a backstory to rocket raccoon. And how he came to be. And a story involving the High Evolutionary played by Chukwudi Iwuji who is the villain. The film is big, fast paced, and action packed. It is filled with a bit of a emotional story which can be dark and concluding characters arcs. James Gunn script and direction does know how to handle the pacing, action and emotional story.The visual effects are amazing. The music score and soundtrack is great. Great cast ensemble. Plus new additions like Will Poulter and Chukwudi Iwuji which they deliver. The action sequences are big and exciting.Overall, this third Guardians film delivers it all. And i can not wait to see where it goes next.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","siderite","6 August 2023","What was fun novelty, a combination of Earth American music, wacky characters and impossible odds backed by the special effects from Marvel and a lot of cameos, now feels tired and overstretched. What was fresh and subtle now it's pouring tastelessly on your head. Everything, from the classic music hits, the gags, the action scenes, the special effects, they just come at you from all directions all the time. And it's not really fun. It is just exhausting.I don't know what went wrong, was it the editing? Was it supposed to be a magnum opus of 4 hours or something and then it was cut to shreds? Was is James Gunn going all out with no oversight and no one to tell him he goes overboard? The characters start of as damaged and annoying, frustrated as well as frustrating, only to then change leaf whenever the story needs it to. The slow motion purposeful walking scenes with an oldie but goldie soundtrack doesn't do it anymore and not when it happens again and again and again. The villain jumps from being god-like to a silly little man. The monsters from super powerful to one shot kills. And there are so so so many characters that mean nothing to me.There were some genuinely wonderful scenes in the film, but few and far between. I hope with fresh new ideas, not like the Guardians, James Gunn is going to resurrect Disney, but at the same time I fear its too late, that he's already spent and corrupted by a system that rewards formulaic quantity to any semblance of creative quality. I like the guy's work, but for me this film has been more miss than hit.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","A7medSalah","4 May 2023","A tremendous closure of the MCU's best and most consistent trilogy. Great fun, with insane action and doses of classic Guardians heart & soul! It will leave you emotionally shattered, but filled with so much hope and optimism.First, The MVP of the movie and i will not be even exaggerating when i say the whole trilogy, Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the emotional core of this one, so much time is spent exploring his past and it leads to the most emotionally devastating moments and he absolutely brings it.Chris Pratt is just as strong as before as Peter Quill, there's always been a sadness beneath the charming exterior but after all the previous losses its starting to come to the surface in terrific fashion as he's determined to protect his family this time around.Chukwudi Iwuji is an amazing villain, eschewing the usual tortured past of most villains for a character who is just plain evil and larger than life, played to perfection.Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff remain really funny throughout but the film wisely still takes time to offer reminders of their dramatic chops as well.Groot is just Groot that we love i will not say anything more.I think Will Poulter's Adam Warlock was a mixed bag at best. Though I liked how seriously Poulter played the character, there weren't really enough parts in the film that let him to stand out too much Nevertheless, Im excited to see him in the future.Cosmo is a New addition to the family and what a Great one i loved it so much can't wait for the character future because Cosmo is great in the comics. On the other hand Nebula arc is one of the best arcs in MCU history that is all I'm going to say.John Murphy Music shares more stylistically with The Suicide Squad opposed to Tyler Bates work but it still remembers to use that iconic theme at the right moment and Awesome Mix - Vol 3 is excellent. No longer focusing on a single decade it creates something much more unique.Finally, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 may be an uneven film at times, but it remains touching and endearing, with a fascinating study of its characters. Overall, it's a fitting and satisfying conclusion to one of Marvel's most beloved franchises.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","FeastMode","5 May 2023","This third chapter in the Guardians series feels like it has a new style of its own while keeping the essence of the previous ones. It's a much more serious tone which I really enjoyed.Like with the last two MCU movies, they dial back the comedy and do a better job of placing it strategically. The jokes feel organic as opposed to the ""insert joke here"" style. And they never take away from a serious moment. And man are there some serious moments.This movie is emotionally powerful. I felt such a range of emotions and they all hit hard. They take their time with the scenes and allow you to simmer in that moment. And the beautiful music magnifies all of this.The arguments between characters are all compelling. I like the added focus on mantis after seeing Pom's performance in the Holiday Special. And I'm so glad they pushed the PG-13 rating pretty far. I would love to continue seeing darker elements explored without holding back as much.I've never been part of the MCU fatigue crowd because I don't fatigue from fun entertainment. But I was a little nervous after two of the last three movies were near the bottom of my rankings (Thor 4 and Ant-Man 3). But with Guardians 3, hope is restored that they can bounce back if they falter.And it seems like they're listening to feedback. This feels more like giving the reigns to the director and allowing him to put his own stamp on it. It feels like its own movie rather than another template movie. And they fixed the comedy. This is how comedy should be incorporated into the movie, the exact opposite example of Thor 4.(2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 5/4/2023, IMAX 5/16/2023)","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","tareqzaghal","3 September 2023","Gunn's farewell to these characters and universe accomplishes everything it aimed for amidst the mediocrity of the MCU post-Endgame. It's clear that there is passion behind this work, there is love for these characters, and there is a desire to do their stories just and set them off in the most caring way possible.Every character gets their moment to shine and is provided a satisfying arc conclusion, you believe these relationships because Gunn has been able to guide the audience throughout his trilogy to fully care for how things might turn out for the Guardians. The action is highly kinetic and energetic, I loved how he fully utilised the IMAX scenes with incredible use of scope. The hallway scene is undeniably a highlight as well. Bright and colourful, the set design stands out as probably the most creative of the MCU by far, especially the sequence at the OrgoCorp headquarters.The story develops in a very organic way, even if it focuses on Rocket for the majority of it, it still feels balanced despite feeling like there were too many flashbacks during the first watch. The High Evolutionary's performances was better this time too. The Counter-Earth segment is still creepy, weird stuff o look at. A bit too long, but it has to accomplish a lot, Gunn has to deal with consequences from previous instalments and other projects that affect his characters. Everything with how Gamora and Quill's relationship was really well handled and interwoven, but as for Adam Warlock, not so much.I've grown accustomed to the regular ""Gunn-isms"" that are present in each of his films, but Vol.3 shines as an example of how important passion is, especially when making a comic book blockbuster, without it, many like the failures being released nowadays, won't stand the test of time, but this has a strong chance of doing so.","

It seems Marvel has declined from the moment Disney took control over MCU.The movie want to be a little bit darker but the same cringe humor formula still exist and it's atrocious! The acting from everyone is mediocre. They introduce us to High Evolutionary but he is weak. They give us Adam Warlock in early stages but as well, he seems awfully created!80% of the movie is about a talking racoon and his so called: origins. Drax acting like a silly child. The special effects are awful. And again: even they tried to make this movie a little bit more darker, the ""jokes every 5 minutes"" are there and the jokes are cheesy and cringe!

It was extremely emotional and quite hard to watch at points due to the tough depiction of animal abuse. I am glad we got to see this backstory depicted on screen! There is a particular narrative choice with one character that I am glad they chose to do and did not follow the cliché certain films have already done.One action scene towards the end of the film was so well executed and extreme. It was a blast to watch! Plus, the music always works so well in these films.However, some of the comedy did fall a little flat at points. It does not linger too much on them though and there were just as many comedy moments that did work. Guardians of the Galaxy fans need to see this film!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TheDanishMovie-Nerd","3 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is a remarkable achievement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Director James Gunn has delivered a movie that is colorful, emotional, and a feast for the senses. It is a movie that might just be some of the MCU's finest work to date.The emotions in this film run high, and I was moved to tears at least five times during the course of the movie. The film explores the tragic backstory of Rocket Raccoon through effective use of flashbacks, which adds a layer of emotional depth to the character. This is a movie that is not afraid to be vulnerable, and it is all the better for it.Every single character gets their moment to shine in this film, and it is a testament to James Gunn's skill as a writer and director that he manages to balance all of the characters so well. There are plenty of moments of levity and humor, but there are also moments of heartbreak and tragedy. The film manages to strike a perfect balance between these different elements, which is no mean feat.The music in this film is as great as always, and the soundtrack is a highlight. James Gunn has a real knack for choosing the perfect songs for his movies, and the songs in this film are no exception. The visuals in this film are also stunning, and the movie is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and thrilling to watch, and the special effects are top-notch.I have no negative thoughts on this movie. It is a movie that had me emotionally engaged from start to finish, and it has been a long time since the MCU made me feel like this. This might just crack my personal top 5 MCU movies, and it is a movie that I will be thinking about for a long time to come.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is a colorful, emotional masterpiece that is a must-see for Marvel fans and moviegoers alike. James Gunn has crafted a film that is both visually stunning and emotionally engaging, and it is a testament to the power of storytelling. The film is an incredible achievement and one that I cannot recommend enough.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","darkreignn","7 May 2023","""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3"" is, no doubt, a quality film. From the subdued and subtle opening to the more bombastic and high-octane action set-pieces, writer and director James Gunn knows how to put his own unique stamp on the tired genre of super hero films - so much so that ""Guardians 3"" doesn't even feel like a super hero movie, and that's a good thing. More of a somber drama than the whimsical space-adventure of the previous two films, this third, and seemingly final, entry plays things very straight, telling an emotional story that may have you fighting back tears. Gunn has a clear care for both the source material and the story he's trying to tell, and it's evident; this is, without a doubt, a James Gunn movie through and through. The problem with that, for me, is that - and I mean this with the utmost respect - James Gunn is a fan of the bizarre and macabre, and I feel as if ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3"" was just a bit too bizarre and macabre for my taste.I saw this movie twice in order to best solidify my thoughts on it because, after my first viewing, I honestly left the theatre confused; and honestly, even after second viewing I still find myself conflicted. On one hand, the movie works as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, filled with emotion and beautiful characterization, with themes of family and friendship ringing true throughout the entire running time. Additionally, the action, the CGI, it all looks stunning, all of it elevated by the story's dramatic heft; not since Endgame has an MCU film been this emotionally resonant. I also don't even need to mention the soundtrack, because you already know it's going to be amazing, and it is - I was tapping my foot constantly throughout the film. On the other hand, however, despite all of the good this movie contains, I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed watching it because, well, I really didn't.While ""Guardians 3"" stands out from the MCU pack, it does so to the detriment of my personal viewing experience. To put it frankly, I found this movie disturbing. Without specific spoilers, the movie deals heavily with animal cruelty, a theme that I didn't necessarily realize I had a problem with until I watched this movie and was privy to Frankenstein-esque animals that look more like something out of a horror film than they do a kids super hero movie. And it's not so much their appearance that's the problem, but rather the mental images that will flicker in your mind as you imagine what said animals had to go through to look the way they do. The film is surprisingly graphic, and I can imagine many children leaving the theatre traumatized based on this aspect alone - hell, I'm an adult, and I found myself feeling queasy and disgusted, with the images sticking with me long after the credits rolled.So, it'll be up to you if the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3."" Maybe you'll find yourself uplifted by the undeniable positivity the movie does have, or maybe the tone is a fitting change of pace for you when compared to recent super hero films. While I am looking forward to seeing this film again strictly for its soundtrack (it really is that good), ultimately the depictions of animal cruelty proved to be too disturbing for me to fully enjoy the film.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Avwillfan89","7 May 2023","This was a lot to take in!Although the Guardians films have always had a great mix of both dark and goofy, funny moments, this one takes it on much more serious level, with themes and scenes of animal torture/mutilation/experimentation, eugenics, and genocide.Rocket's backstory and how he became what he is today (both physically and psychologically) is absolutely heartbreaking, and is definitely the strongest parts of the story.The High Evolutionary is probably one of the nastiest, evil villains Marvel has yet produced, making Thanos look almost benevolent. Chukwudi Iwuji plays him like a Shakespearean villain, and in successfully terrifying manner.Despite some storylines being underdeveloped, unexplored or left out entirely, this is a welcome breath of fresh air after the utter atrocity that was Quantumania. Although it won't be enough to save the MCU from its steak of mediocre films, it's a good start.And Rocket truly deserves all the happiness in the world after all he's been through.","

Thus, I also opted to sit down and watch the 2023 movie ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". And I have to admit that I am very glad that I did, because ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" turned out to be really enjoyable. And it was without a doubt, the best of the three movies in the franchise.The storyline in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", as written by writer and director James Gunn, just felt very wholesome, and it brought a lot of nice details to the various characters. I especially enjoyed the entire focus point on Rocket and his backstory; that one really added so many layers to the character and it was rather nicely written.Running at 150 minutes, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" doesn't feel like a long movie, because director James Gunn manages to keep the pacing going at full throttle throughout the entire movie. Thumbs up on that accomplishment.It is always nice to see returning cast on the screen reprising their characters, and that was definitely the issue in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". A good cast ensemble returned to the screen, and that was applicable to both the main cast, but also for support cast in small roles. That adds a good sense of continuity to the storyline.Visually, then you know that Marvel goes all in, guns blazing. And they also did that in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", oh boy did they ever! The CGI effects in the movie are through the roof, and that adds a lot of feel and flavor to bringing the universe in which the movie takes place to life. Lots of attention to detail. The props, wardrobe and make-up departments also worked very nicely here.If you enjoy Marvel movies, then ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a movie that is well-worth sitting down and spending 150 minutes on watching.My rating of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Kingslaay","5 June 2023","Alright I will be bucking the trend here but as someone who loves films I want to honestly share my views on here. I am surprised by the high reviews and ratings on here. I was left somewhat disappointed with this film. It felt all over the place. The strong points was Rocket's origin story and the somewhat dark and serious nature of the film. But a lot of the film was unnecessary noise that added little to no value. The main villain and their motivation is poorly explained and illustrated. You needed to say more and explain 'why' he is doing what he's doing. We had a whole bunch of children randomly feature in the film and Gamora has returned after being killed off in the Avengers film but with little to no explanation as to how and why she's different. Also despite being a darker film, a key feature of Marvel films has been its great humour. This film has very small doses of it that do not help balance the film and sustain it.Sadly Volume 3 is a far cry from its two predecessors. What made Guardians of the Galaxy great was its quirky nature, over the top characters, humour and great soundtrack. The soundtrack featured forgettable and B side 80s tracks. It's a shame the send off for the Guardians was not on a high note.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","vandykeu","6 August 2023","I'm not a comic fan, and have never really gotten into the medium at all. I'm definitely one of those who enjoyed the MCU up to Endgame but has had major superhero fatigue for a while now. I watch most of the Marvel films because they are good cheap thrills, but... it is getting pretty stale.Guardians 3 though, doesn't really feel like a Marvel film. The whole trilogy is clearly a part of Marvel, but it feels more like a space-opera. More like Star Wars, or Firefly, or something like that. James Gunn has done a wonderful job of building characters, storylines, and a world here, and in third film he goes even further.One of the things I really like about this film is how it shows the consequences of past stories. Marvel has taken these characters on some major emotional rides since Infinity War, and Gunn is not afraid to show us how the characters have been affected, and how they have grown. I really like how each of the 'team' gets their own closure in their own way. Likewise, here, he delves into Rocket's backstory, which is one of the saddest things I've ever seen. This film has emotional impact far beyond a typical Marvel movie, and it is one of the best as a result.The only critique I have is that the villain is a bit over the top. I at first would call him a Mengele, but Mengele was too banal for this. The villain here knows what he is doing and revels in it. On one hand, this is a good step away from Marvel humanizing many of its villains (even disagreeing with Thanos, for example, you can kind of see his point). Here, the villain has no redeeming qualities, but as a result is a bit too purely evil. It works, and you certainly root for Rocket to get his revenge, but it is the weak link of the film.I don't have high hopes for where Marvel is going in terms of a broader story, and I kind of think they should have quit while ahead with Endgame. It has felt like most of the following films have been moneygrabs. But, this one stands up, and is worthwhile.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jql_longhurst","23 May 2023","The miserable run from Marvel since EndGame has depressed our entire family. Dr Strange/Multiverse broke the camel's back. Surely, Guardians would be the shining light amidst the darkness. A brilliant cast with brilliant chemistry couldn't possibly go wrong. Wow. How wrong we were. The darkness, the unending anger across the board, even from the softer souls in 1&2. Child abduction, vivid animal cruelty, and two key characters omitted or morphed in such a way that the rest of the cast delivered banter with juddering effect. Heartbroken. Hopefully, like Star Wars, we will get a true, uplifting Finale2. The Guardians deserve it, and so do we.","

This third film is no exception. There are some really strong moments but ultimately this film is the least funny, out of the trilogy, fails at being effectively serious, and feels more like an in-between film rather than a conclusive end to a trilogy. We learn more about Rocket's backstory, things we already knew, and the characters are set up for future films/Shows. That's all you get from the film. It Sucks.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","KFstudios2009","24 August 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the third installment and the final movie in the trilogy. I haven't seen the previous movies, but it wasn't much you got to understand from the previous, what was good about it. Great space adventure, that shows us the moral of that you should not harm people and animals, and that teamwork and friendship is important. This time we got more flashback from Rockets past, Rocket The Raccoon was a experiment for the perfect society, but the villain didn't want to make things perfect, he just hated the things the way the were. Rockets flashbacks and experiments was heartbreaking and very emotional moments, that almost made me cry. His friends, the other Guardians, tried to save him in this movie, because Rocket was about to die, and his flashbacks come. The movie were great directed by James Gunn. They made a generic plot in an interesting way. Funny dialogues, sometimes confusing, but that is what made it funny. Great visuals and scenography, and I really got the space adventure feeling. Beside of Rocket, I liked some of the other characters, like Peter Quill, played by Chris Pratt, he was funny and you could almost think that he really was a guardian. Cosmo the space dog was funny, not so important but made the movie. I think if Cosmo wasn't included, I would give this movie 7/10, not 8/10. Groot don't speak too much, and he is not the best character, but acceptable. When Guardians travelled between the planets, it flows really smooth and the planets were very detailed so you got a lot of information from each planet, what made me understand more of the planet's perspective and the people that lived there. I think they presented the moral of friendship and family in the movie. From Rockets flashbacks we can learn that harming others is bad, and that freedom is important. You can learn a lot, a movie full of moral and value. If you like Marvel movies, then you should watch it. If you like space adventures and funny dogs, this movie is highly recommended. Well done, James Gunn did a good job, one of the best Marvel movies of the year, much better than Ant-Man in Quantamania.","

Once again, James Gunn delivers a masterpiece here, Adam Warlock is finally in the MCU, and we finally get the backstory of Rocket, which was something we all were looking for.The one thing I gotta say is, everything is so well done here, but we finally a simple villain. Lately all Marvel villains have found ways to redeem themselves, something that I really don't like at all. Thankfully we didn't get that here. Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary should be winning an Oscar for this performance alone, his acting is off the charts in this movie. No redemption necessary, just simply evil.Rocket's backstory is another highlight of this movie. For the past two movies he was just there. This movie, he gets a bigger role and I really love Bradley Cooper's acting here as much as Chukwudi Iwuji's.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","yahaira-729-694701","3 October 2023","One of the best productions coming out of Marvel studios. The writing on this volume 3 brought home the theme of animal experimentation which is the true story is about Rockets origin and his creators. Rocket became who he was because of the lord that made him as a reflection of his quest for a perfect universe. But like all despots that weild power things tend to backfire. The visuals and special effects are great at times though the action space was disorienting were they on a ship or some planet their home base. This one was an action drama to my view point then the previous 2 volumes. I did cry throgh parts of it there is no mercy for animal brutality. Cheers to the outstanding cast and writers.","

It was a proper Marvel movie we got to see in recent years. The movie had more emotional tone and all the characters had more depth in this concluding part. Rocket's backstory was also good and emotional and it moves you. The songs prevent the story from becoming boring. The story was engaging and even after having long runtime and uneven pacing, the story doesn't fail to entertain you. The climax was also nice and it makes you emotional as it feels like end of something beautiful. Overall, James Gunn delivered a beautiful Marvel movie.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","MxS7HGS","14 December 2023","The rollercoaster ride that is James Gunn's direction in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 left me both laughing and crying, and then crying even harder. I have a love-hate relationship with it, but I cannot deny the excellent needle drops, signature humor, and action that we have come to expect from a Gunn film.However, the film falls prey to the usual MCU plunders and feels stuck in a tug-of-war between Gunn and Marvel. The sheer number of characters makes it messy and difficult to find harmony in its multiple swan songs.Despite this, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 works extremely well at its core, with a surprisingly interesting villain and a truly moving goodbye that most fans of the Guardians will love and appreciate. I will surely miss these weirdos.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Floated2","4 August 2023","After nearly a six year hiatus from the previous instalment of Guardians of the Galaxy, this third and possibly last film of the franchise takes things to several new heights. The visuals are arguably better than ever and the story is very interesting and keeps everything well balanced with the assortment of characters.The second film was solid but a slight downgrade from the surprise original. Now this third film feels a little more and expands great upon the previous two. With a longer runtime, there is more room for growth and more screen time for secondary characters.What is impressive is how the film incorporates different genres blending from action to adventure, comedy, drama with silly, funny then heartfelt and quite sad moments. Raccoon definitely steals the show, along with a talking dog Cosmo. Nebula and Mantis also have bigger roles which is great. Gamora was reduced noticeably. Overall very great film and better than initially expected.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","BA_Harrison","3 May 2023","I'm not the biggest fan of GOTG, but I've got one of those Unlimited cards, so seeing the third film didn't cost me any extra. Volume 3 hasn't changed my opinion of the series - it's another loud, flashy, action-packed explosion of CGI, with a catchy soundtrack and lots of the same brand of humour that hasn't worked for me in either of the previous films, and it left me rather bored at times.At two hours and thirty minutes, it really is way too long for this kind of popcorn nonsense: director James Gunn lets scenes go on and on and on, resulting in a movie more bloated than Starlord's face when he sucks on the vacuum of space. I reckon I would have liked the film more had they trimmed a good half-an-hour to forty-five minutes (virtually every scene could do with tightening). When Gunn is on form - most notably, the visually breathtaking Beastie Boys-backed fight scene and Rocket rescuing the baby raccoons (very touching) - the film works well, but there are too many moments that drag, often as a result of the lame comedy (Drax reclining on the sofa THREE times, Mantis repeatedly landing clumsily).In my opinion, the best thing about the film is its soundtrack - Alice Cooper, Rainbow, Faith No More, The Beastie Boys and The Flaming Lips!5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","GomezAddams666","5 May 2023","It's safe to say the Guardians of the Galaxy were a pretty obscure property before their film debut, it is also fair to say that nowadays they are embedded into the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a way that you know what to expect from them.This entry is everything a fan of the dysfunctional group would want, a space opera with lots of action, humor and intense stupidity from the main heroes, but we were also warned this time there was going to be an emotional component attached to Rocket's backstory, and they delivered on that promise.In the first movie we learned that Rocket was a science experiment, but we get to learn the identity of the mad scientist here, a highly sadistic and intelligent being named High Evolutionary.Chukwudi Iwuji plays High Evolutionary like a Shakespearean villain, he is a truly terrifying antagonist who transforms living beings into different versions of themselves, he does not want to conquer the universe, merely just transform its inhabitants enough to proclaim himself a god. By the end of the film you will come to hate this character with a burning passion.Marvel has always being criticized for its villains, but it is my unmovable opinion that not only is most of the criticism unfounded, but also this trilogy has amazing villains, with one very notable exception.Will Poulter joins the cast as the ever-powerful Adam Warlock, in the comics he is one of the most formidable beings in the universe, and when this movie introduces him we get to see the extent of his might as he neutralizes the Guardians almost without breaking a sweat, and if the rest of the story had continued in that direction, the film would have been perfect, but unfortunately it did not.The rest of this entry turns Adam into an immature character, a child that didn't completely grow inside the cocoon he was made in, they turned him almost into the comic relief.We have been waiting for Adam Warlock since he was teased in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and it was a huge disappointment. Will Poulter did everything he could with the character, but it seems the filmmakers did not know what to do witch such a powerful being, which is shameful.Overall the movie is very enjoyable with a few problems that unfortunately stand out enough to be noticed. But if this is the last time we see the complete line-up of the Guardians, I can safely say they had a pretty good run.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","med77_99","8 May 2023","They say, if you've seen one Marvel movie, then you've seen them all.Guardians Vol 3 adds absolutely nothing new to the superhero genre, it's dull and quite predictable from start to finish, albeit I walked out possibly 30 minutes before it ended.The plot centers around Rocket, his origins and past. I found the whole story very dull for an adult, perhaps, kids between the ages of 4 and 8 could find it amusing. His past involving brotherly love to other animals being experimented on by an evil warlord was forced and dull.So much melodrama added, they tried making us emotionally connected to the animals, which I didn't feel, i thought they were childish cartoon characters with no background or developed characters. The scene were they chose their names was supposed to be the high point where we identify with them and connect, for me, zero connection.They then added a somewhat violent scene that enraged Rocket, probably for kids, its frightening, for adults was over dramatic.The whole animal unite theme seemed forced.Seemed like a movie called Cats and Dogs or G force.They also tried to build other characters that i felt absolutely no connection with, namely the mohawk telepathy guy and the talking dog.Some humorous scenes were actually funny but only a few. Special effects no longer matter after the hundreds of movies out there using CGI. Action was lame and because of the lack of stakes, there is no tension invested in the scene.The villain is possibly the worst i've ever seen, one dimensional angry lord who doesn't like to be questioned, formulatic and copy paste from Disney villains.For the first time ever, I walked out of a Marvel movie before it ended, i just couldn't tolerate the cringing script and dialogue, the excessive melodrama, the childish scenes and how predictable it was.And yeah, they had to find a group of lost kids who were so annoying but required saving and hurray !!! We are all happy ,,add to that the long run time and i just couldn't sit through it all.For some reasons, the writers and directors thought cute animals and kids will automatically trigger emotions in viewers, which i did not feel whatsoever.Do yourselves a favor and skip this.","

Advised to maybe watch by yourself so you can feel the story!Guardians of the Galaxy is easily my favorite story line in the Marvel universe.Volume 1 had everyone angry and pitted against each other due to each of their own respective painful back stories. But came out as a team. Solid. Volume 2 was what you'd expect. The team doing their thing. Good movie. But expected. But Volume 3...What can I say about Volume 3 other then it insured the deeper meaning of friendship. The meaning of shared circumstances that unites us. If nothing else, we are all the same when we've gone down the same road. Empathy. You can't fake it. You can't fake the bond between friends that have been though the thick of it together.But Volume 4? Where is it going to go from here? With the bar set so high, well... I hope to find out.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","drawlife","6 May 2023","Let me just say that I think GUARDIANS VOL. 1 is one of the MCU's gem and in the MCU's Top 10. It ranks within the higher tier films like the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA sequels, INFINITY WAR and the first AVENGERS. It felt like STAR WARS without it being STAR WARS as Gunn eloquently put it. I thought VOL. 2 was a massive ""recycled"" step backwards with an overload of humor. Yondu is the only thing worthy about VOL.2So I walked into this one with some low expectations due to how I felt about VOL. 2 and the quality of MCU films as of late. While it is a step above VOL. 2, I did feel like the film yanked along the way with so many moments that just tried way too hard to make me feel emotional.This is probably a me thing, but because I'm not particularly an animal lover, I felt Rocket's backstory tried too hard to make me feel sad. It did provide a lot of depth for him and Bradley Cooper does a great job voicing him. I would argue this is probably is his best outing as Rocket so far.In contrast though, respect to Gunn for including animal cruelty and child abduction. I loved that he went there and played around in that dark arena. I absolutely respect the move because I love when the MCU makes an effort to include mature themes and dark elements from time to time. Humor was more tame compared to VOL. 2 and I didn't particularly mind it this time around. Some of the jokes landed and I did find myself chuckling once or twice.Pratt's Star-Lord feels more evolved and not the same go-lucky/quipping thief, and of course he wouldn't as he's mourning the loss of his girlfriend, but there is another version of her that isn't the version he fell in love with. Another move I respect was that he and Gamora did not get back together. It felt real and made bigger impact mirroring the fact that this iteration of the Guardians is finished. Saldana does a good job playing Gamora a bit more savage and merciless.Bautista has good chemistry with Klementieff as shown in the Holiday Special and I'm happy Bautista got more action sequences showcasing Drax's strength. Groot is used to good effect as well. Not as awesome as the first Groot but way better than baby/teenage Groot. Kraglin played by Gunn's brother Sean and Cosmo voiced by Maria Bakalova are also involved in a meaningful way. Again kudos to James Gunn for this juggling act.Will Poulter's Adam Warlock I felt got the short end of the stick. I thought he could have been utilized a little bit better, but I did quite like his portrayal. As for Chukwudi Iwuji, he does a great job being unhinged as the High Evolutionary. Very threatening, menacing and just all out crazy.I did feel the length. I felt the whole part at Orgoscope was unnecessary and dragged the film. I felt they could have just went straight to the High Evolutionary. Again, while the flashbacks provided some depth for Rocket, it felt choppy to me primarily because I'm trying to engage with the overall plot in motion and then I'm watching something where I felt tried too hard to make me care. Rocket in ""animal heaven"" reunited with his friends also felt extremely cheesy. Another example of that was when the film plays with the idea of Star-Lord dying at the end. What bothered me about that was how does he not have his helmet and his jetpack on his ankles that he's known for having? He's flown in space before and yeah I know he was asked to not have weapons in the High Evolutionary's HQ, but he gave his blasters to Groot who hid a bunch of guns, he couldn't have given him his ankle jetpacks or his helmet? This is why I felt like the film is deliberately trying to make me feel emotional.Also this is a minor, comic-book geek nitpick that doesn't really effect the film, but the visual development team gave them the classic comic-book accurate blue and red striped suits and they couldn't give Star-Lord his mask with the accurate helmet from the comics? LOL.Anyways, I respected the darker themes, I respected that if felt like the end with a whole new team assembled and there were some fine performances, but it felt long and wasn't particularly subtle at tugging my heart strings.5/10.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","HafizhMaulana21","9 October 2023","The final journey and mission of the Guardians in their adventures in the universe. For this time, Peter Quill and his team must face enemies from Rocket Racoon's past who want to reclaim Rocket Racoon. The success of their mission depends on the Guardians, otherwise it will be the end for the Guardians.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is an epic conclusion to the adventure story of the Guardians in the universe. The parting story is quite moving and heartwarming to see their departure as Guardians. GotG vol.3 still provides its own experience watching the Guardians with colorful visuals, old songs that are still a mainstay and humors that are still funny and entertaining. However, GotG vol.3 brings something that for me is so deep. Bringing to a glimpse of Rocket Racoon's past which turns out to make us sad and concerned. The friendship scene between Theefs, Floor, Rocket and of course Lyla brings us a moving atmosphere and a strong feeling of friendship between them. It can be said that this third series brings a much deeper element to see the sadness of Rocket Racoon's past. Rocket's past makes us stunned by how experiments on animals are so cruel and not so good. Overall, GotG vol.3 is the conclusion of a slick and extraordinary Guardians story. The new cast, Chukwudi Iwuji and Will Poulter, become new characters who make a good impression with a slick performance. Chukwudi who played The High Revolutionary became the most memorable character as a villain. The character is just right, appears aggressively, and is able to give the impression of a villain who is really evil and threatening. Likewise with Will Poulter as Adam Warlock which for me is very perfect. The appearance is fairly new but able to bring a positive impression to fans. Of course, it is very sad to see the members of the Guardians who are starting to live their new stories and scatter each other. Meanwhile, now the Guardians have a new member to look forward to.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","kuner-59029","6 May 2023","It goes to show what kind of pull James Gunn has, when he got Disney to greenlight a movie, where there's a gory closeup of someone's skinned, bleeding face, after their face was just torn off. There's also a lot of animal torture and other really grim stuff.Most of the violence remains inconsequential, especially the many teased or hinted deaths of main characters, complete with sad music as they are beaten half to death, frozen, shot through the heart or decapitated, only to be fine again a moment later.And so, without any real consequences or emotional stakes, the cruelty on screen is little more than torture porn.On one hand, I would generally applaud Disney for their audacity, if the violence and misery served a purpose. It doesn't. The emotional payoffs aren't there, and the film leaves you feeling manipulated and cheated. Where Rian Johnson attempts to subvert audience's expecations, Gunn subverts their emotions. Neither seem to regard their audiences as anything other than lab rats.However, Gunn isn't without talent, and there are several beautiful shot compositions, some clever writing and a few instances of well used music. Gunn even at his worst and most self-indulgent is still more interesting than the usual MCU conveyer belt slop. Any 5 minutes of GotG3 has more humor and heart than the entirety of Thor Love and Thunder or Eternals.It's a shame. James Gunn is undoubtedly talented, but he is too full of himself to temper himself when story demands it, and there's something really misanthropic and sadistic about him, that just seeps into his movies. He trivializes suffering and cruelty in a way that is indicative of a psychopathic mind, like someone who would watch Schindler's List and make scat jokes about the boys hiding in the toilet.I can separate the artist from the art, however, and maintain that the first GotG1 is one of the best MCU movies to date (if not the best). This third one, however, left me feeling dirty, like after that Terrifier movie.If you liked the Saw or Hostel movies, chances are you'll like this. Everyone else may want to skip this latest death throe of the MCU.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","olcare","10 May 2023","First of all, I should say that this review will be quite long (for those who feel lazy, they should check out the note section at the end but it inclouds spoilers). I hope someone reads it and shares the same intensity as me, maybe someone has already shared it. I have been a Marvel fan for a long time, and I can easily say that this movie is good, but it is also sad that it took me 3 days to post this review, and I am really overwhelmed right now, let me start.First of all, I want to talk about the team and harmony. I cannot list the actors one by one, nor the technical team, but I can easily say that everything was good, even though it sometimes tended to be too cliché, I think the script was not bad; it was even much better than the last 7-8 Marvel movies. I thank James Gunn for making me feel these emotions and for writing a good ending for the original team.Let me explain my favorite part, Rocket... The story of Rocket was well-incorporated into the plot and the script, and it was extremely critical for a superhero movie. I think it was also very strong and special because it contained animal rights references with the backstory of our character who suffered torture, and it made me feel very emotional, especially when he became the leader of the new team just like in the comics.If we look at the overall movie, there are 2-3 plot errors, but they blended 2 storylines very well. Additionally, the action scenes were quite good, and although I read a lot of comments stating that there was not enough action in some parts, I disagree; the action was appropriate. Although Gamora's story did not satisfy me much, I don't think it was bad either. However, I think the stories of Drax, Groot, Mantis, and Nebula were quite normal and good, and the idea of not killing anyone in the team was also good; it was appropriate for them to lead a normal life. I do not know if the new team will make us feel as emotional as the old team, but it is definitely exciting.My disappointments were the portrayal of Adam Warlock and our villain, High Evolutionary. Although the motivation of our villain was good, due to some bad screenplay choices, he did not fit perfectly as the clearest and well-intentioned villain of Marvel in recent times. (I would like to add a little note here: there was a bit too much over-acting sometimes, which bothered me.) Adam Warlock was a huge disappointment; they shaved off many parts of the character by taking him out of the cocoon early, while he was supposed to be a much more serious and harsh character, I hope his character development will be much better. Because his baby-like behavior in the movie was too long and boring, which was very frustrating. Gamora was also a bit different; in short, I don't know even the Gamora of the same timeline, they confused this issue a bit.The movie was good in terms of technical and CGI aspects. Although I have not liked the CGI that Marvel has done lately, it was quite good in this movie, which made me very happy. The use of music was also the best I've seen lately. It was a fantastic detail that was extremely well placed, despite a lot of music.In short, the place of this trilogy is very special for me. It was a good choice to make this movie emotional, and in some parts, it was really difficult to hold back tears, and I was amazed by Rocket's scene of losing his friends. Of course, there are minor problems, but I did not feel them because the strong parts were much better, and the movie flowed smoothly like water. I hope we will see these characters again...Note: I also thought Star-Lord's return to Earth was a great idea, Drax becoming a father, Nebula becoming a leader, Mantis being free, Rocket becoming a leader, and Groot accompanying him, all of it was fitting. When I left the movie, I felt strange because I didn't think about its missing parts, but rather how emotional and fragile life can be. This movie reminded me that I had forgotten some things, how precious animals are, and most importantly, that your teams define who you are.""","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","donz-8","20 May 2023","I'll keep this review short and simple. Aside from some awkwardly silly jokes and (only sometimes) slightly confusing pace, this was the best installment from the GOTG series. For the first time in a very long while, I really got 'pulled' in to the movie emotionally, something that hasn't happened since ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"". Since this review requires more ""characters"" I'll just add that GOTG 3 was a perfect finale to the series and I'm looking forward to the ""New Guardians"" (or whatever name they'll be referred to). With all of that being said, Guardians Vol. 3 is, without a doubt, one of the best MCU movies, definitely in the top 5 and well worth the price of admission.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","carterkev","12 September 2023","Sorry but what the hell is this mess. Marvel have lost it, it's time to pack it in. All the high scores on here must be paid or something. The film is stupid, all over the place, fat to much CGI and the so called humour in it is just not funny. The first one was good the second one was ok but this is a wreck of a film. Gamora character just annoying with the bad attitude all the time. I wanted to turn it off after half an hour I had had enough, but my wife gave it a go and even she, who is a fan said it just didn't work. I hope this is the end they need to move on and stop spending millions on CGI and get back to good stories and characters. Rocket is the best but they just made this depressing and awful.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jamaisj","24 November 2023","This is arguably one of the best MCU movies. There is nothing really wasted, and everything has its place. While I wish Warlock had been better used, even he works. There are some really great running gags, Rocket's arc is great, and it's fun to see an almost campy villain.The only major strike against the movie is the High Evolutionary, who has little to do with his comic counterpart; this villain is just more of a psychopath with lots of resources. But it does lead to one of the most epic space fights I've ever seen, so I'll allow it. Well, that and the Stallone cameos.This is the perfect way to end a trilogy, but still leave plenty of room for a sequel. The humor is perfect, as well as the bathos of Rocket. This is an almost-perfect movie, and should be mandatory watching.","

It was disgusting. Thankfully my 11 year old opted to stay home for this cinema trip. It was just way too much, I'm really disappointed. What the hell Disney!?More disturbing than some horror movies. Not suitable for kids at all.The parts without animal abuse were ok, we laughed a few times but felt like crying more often than not.Hopefully the true reviews shine through and Disney have a long hard look at themselves.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","T-ZER0","30 August 2023","Just when I think they have gone to the dogs, they manage to come out with a hit that I enjoy! Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is well-written, clever, funny and even made me cry a bit. This movie is essentially the equivalent of Avengers Endgame for the Guardians, they introduce new characters and give the old ones a loving send off.I wish they had Nova, but he wouldn't fit as they had so many characters already. I do wish Star-Lord and Gamora got back together, because I thought since the first one had to do with Peter's mother, and the second one his father, maybe the third will be a love story between them on how they get back together. But they instead focus on Rocket, which I have no problem with. They added Lyla Beaver, which is who I wanted to see after playing the Telltale video game.I literally was filled with emotion on the way they handled Rocket's story and how sad it was, but that made it more satisfying when he got payback against the high evolutionary. Speaking of which, I do think that Kang would have fit more in this movie as James Gunn originally intended, but the High Evolutionary works just fine. I also loved Cosmo in this film, despite what anyone says, She's a good dog. ;) and I wish I had a pet like her.In addition, they had a Michael Rooker cameo that was worth it, and seeing them finally separate made me sad. Also hearing Groot's first official English sentence! James Gunn clearly knows how to make a Marvel movie that is heartfelt and funny at the same time. I am so glad all of us made Disney finish this legendary trilogy. Hats off to you and all the fans. Also, thank you James Gunn. Your Guardians trilogy will be forever timeless. Best of luck to you as you go on to fix DC. We will miss you!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","lifebythesmile","22 May 2023","This review contains no spoilers (and really there is nothing to spoil)I loved the first two Guardians movies. Yes they had fantastic special effects. Loads of action, yes. But more importantly they were well written, well thought out, well acted, had some truly beautiful choreography. The humor was fantastic. Quirky and clever. There were some truly touching moments. They made you think a bit, but they also made you feel something. They were more than movies. They were an experience. And I had dearly hoped that this last installment would live up to my expectations, but to my deep disappointment it did not.This movie like so many others today demands that we move past the reasonable suspension of disbelief, and into the suspension of intelligence.The non-stop action and pretty colors didn't save it from a plot full of holes. The humor managed to produce a chuckle or two yes, but ultimately it felt trite, forced, staged. And cinema is chock full of examples showing that a talented cast cannot salvage a movie from bad writing. Honestly, every time the movie tripped on a moment that was supposed to illicit some kind of emotional response I found myself cringing and thinking the script, the dialogue, must have been cobbled together by someone so lacking in emotional depth that the best they can do is regurgitate the old tropes they've seen watching other shows. They can't create what they don't understand so the best they can manage is to mimic. It was painful.And the fact that this movie has been given a rating of 8.3 by the viewing public tells me people have lost the ability to distinguish good from bad. I guess if Hollywood feeds people garbage long enough they stop realizing it's garbage and start thinking it's caviar.To me it's just another ugly sign of the ongoing decay of society. We have lost an appreciation for finer things. Most people can't even recognize quality any more. The older I get (and I'm not that old, yet) the more I have to look to the past for good cinema. Or to IFC movies. Or to foreign films.Mainstream media today is more and more....empty calories. It's bright, it's loud, it's fast....and it's it devoid or any real sustenance.What value this movie had was only in that it convinced me that there in the long, sad decline of Marvel there is no bottom. And it's time to stop giving them my money.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","anonim-73883","7 May 2023","And so, the third ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is an excellent and I would even say epic conclusion to the entire trilogy of ""Guardians"".Let me start off by saying that I consider all Guardians movies to be the best Marvel movies ever!James Gunn filmed an unusual
CARTOON, but shot the best MOVIE in the MARVEL cinematic universe!For me, the third part is not inferior in quality to the first two parts (I have not watched the special yet)
I liked the plot of the film, surprisingly 150 minutes running time flew by very quickly and not noticeable!It was exciting, not boring and interesting.I am very happy that in this part, my favorite character Rocket became one of the main characters, only because of him I fell in love with the guards team and I am happy that in this part we were told the details about his difficult childhood.He is fully developed in this film, and his arc is closed, as well as the story arcs of other characters were closed perfectly.The whole time I laughed, empathized and worried about the characters, and also cried at some points.Also, I want to note the excellent acting and actors, excellent camera work, excellent graphics and VFX effects, a wonderful soundtrack, and much, much more, I did not notice any minuses in this film!In general, the third ""Guardians"" turned out to be quite an excellent, sweet, touching and lamp family film more than once.I give this film 10 out of 10 and I advise you to go to the cinema to see this film!P. S: MARVEL please make a spin-off movie / series / special about Rocket Raccoon!!!Because I would like to know what happened before Rocket got into the Guardian team and met Quill, and what happened after he left the laboratory !!!","

Rocket it the main character who is dreaming about his childhood when he got hurt and is in the coma while Star lord and the other guardians try to help him. But the antagonist is the evolutionary who evolves things and wants to study rockets brain because he could solve something he could not. With Yondu coming back made me happy because he rocked in the last movie even though he is dead he is there. Star lord gives the guardians leader name to rocket at the end and leaves to live with his grandfather and at the end of the credit cut scene it says "" The legendary Star lord will return.""","

To be a sci-fi movie with alien and animal-robot hybrids, it had a tremendous amount of heart. The scenes with Rocket, Lylla, Teefs, and Floor were some of the best out of the entire film. So much love was poured into these animated characters! Guardians of the Galaxy has been one of my favorite series to emerge from the MCU. It has important themes about finding meaningful friendship in a universe where you feel as if you don't belong. I am sad to say goodbye to these characters and their stories, especially because I spent many hours watching them with my mother and making sweet memories, but I am so glad we've been able to enjoy the journey with them. To everyone involved with this project, well done! 👏","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","prmacrae-13277","28 May 2023","My wife and I have rarely watched a movie that bored us as much as this one. There is no coherent plot or story line. There are so many characters its hard to keep track of them and the ""villain"" is not comic or particularly villainous, apart from shouting. There is very little humour, as the first two films had. Whenever the story flags, there's a fight scene of some sort. In its favour, the computer graphics are amazing, and there's a lot of imagination in the sets and backgrounds. But that's not enough to carry a movie, even a Marvel movie. As he did in Jurassic Park: Dominion, Chris Pratt looked embarrassed at times at the absurdity of his character and lines. I'd give this one a miss if I were you. If there were zero stars, that's what I'd give this film. What a waste of millions of dollars when good writing might have actually saved this.","

This one his rock bottom.It feels like a super long Seinfeld episode: a movie about nothing but which pretends to have something. Sentimentality replaces substance.

I had a lot of issues with the film that took out basically any enjoyment. However, that didn't sour my hopes for this film. Following Suicide Squad and an excellent Holiday Special, my trust was put into James Gunn to deliver the conclusion that this team needed. And we got that and so much more. How a plot about a genetically engineered raccoon can touch on all my heart strings and make me cry is absolutely outstanding but James Gunn did it. He gives all of these characters such human personalities that you can't help but fall in love with every single one of these characters. The villain here is the strongest of the series by far. He is horrible in every regard and has no redeeming qualities. Each Guardian gets to complete their journey in the MCU. With an amazing soundtrack, fantastic performances all around, and a thrilling plot that gets really emotional at times, James Gunn leaves Marvel with a perfect film that is everything I asked for and more.","

And the end.Most of film just seemed contrived, with poor pacing. Lots and lots of yelling, anger, and just didn't seem to come together like the last films.Not sure what happened, but it just didn't seem able to ""find itself.""
Sure, there were new characters, which helped, but the main cast just seemed uninterested, lacking that chemistry that made the first two so great. Heck, the Christmas episode blew this one away. Even the laughter of Drax wasn't enough to keep this afloat.Not sure how anyone could rate this above a 7, not only as a standalone, but especially as part of such a wonderful series. It was, dare I say, boring- with the exception of Rocket and the last few minuets.","

The scenery and costumes are beyond fake...did the audience need Rocket's backstory? Drax is as annoying as ever and the cool music that made the first movie stand out is forced and overdone. Nothing about this movie makes sense and it was difficult to pay attention to front the start. There's also random usuals of unexpected foul language that's out of character.The characters remind me of all the randoms you'd see in the Star Wars films and I think Disney just cobbled together scenes on all of the unused sets they had lying around from their mediocre Star Wars spin offs. This movie seems rushed and can't hold a candle to precious guardians of the galaxy films.","

I am familiar with the origin of rocket raccoon in the comics, and although this was changed, it still made logical sense, and it was great to see his friend Lyla,in it, ditto, lots of other characters from the comics,(.. I chuckled when I spotted Howard, the duck in a scene,-I know his film was pilloried, but I remember I didn't think it was too bad in at all...), I was not sure about Will Poulter playing Adam warlock, but in the end I thought he did very well, as did everybody in this superb romp. My wife and I had laughter and tears in equal measure, easily the best of the three films. The first film was a breath of fresh air, the second was still fun if a little generic, but this one was a fitting climax to the trilogy, although at the end it did say ' star, Lord will return'.... Got to say, I would have to be interested in that, especially if Mr Gunn is at the Helm. Great Stuff!!!.....","

That unspoken thing that they had was one of the best things in superhero movie history. In my opinion the best power couple ever (and I'm a DC>>>Marvel type of guy, because of Batman).Anyway, the movie although much darker than vol. 1 and 2, has a powerful message in the end, as well as a good enough dose of positivity, something that ultimately this planet needs. The depiction of the Guardians is great, new team included. I also loved the fact that the High Evolutionary didn't have a backstory, because I bet that when everyone shed also a tear when we watched tears falling down from Thanos eyes when Mantis was keeping him under control, as his was still grieving for Gamora, as well as the end if Infinity War with him sitting and wathcing the sunset in peace, after fullfilling his purpose.","

The movie amazingly shows the relationship between the guardians and there relation with rocket specially peter and rocket relationship. It's shows there struggle to save rocket through out whole movie and also shows how far have they come compare to the first movie. Just like a average marvel movie the color and aesthetic of the movie was vibrant for most of the places.

It's heavier & more violent than its precursors, but it manages to retain some of the levity this series is known for to keep things from getting too dark. This emotional rollercoaster is longer than it needed to be, with some sloppy screenplay moments to justify certain plot points and move things along. And the ending feels rushed as it tries to wrap everything up.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","joshuavogel79","15 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy isn't really about a gang. It's Peter Quill's story. He's the only one of them who isn't a cartoon. We're emotionally invested in Peter from the moment our trilogy takes off.In this movie, Peter takes a back seat to Rocket, a character whose best attribute is that he was used just sparingly enough that he didn't ruin the first movie. He was only ever comic relief. The tone of this character was clownish on the moment we meet him. It was an absolutely ridiculous mistake to the side to try to use him as the emotional centerpiece of this story.He was an adequately CGI'd cartoon. Most of us tolerated him as a character, ask the necessary baggage required to bring a children's comic book to life. Whoever wrote this movie apparently thought that they could leverage a hatred of animal cruelty into some sort of emotional connection with a character that has not an ounce of believability.The Russian space dog had more depth than rocket.The movie we came here to see was the continuation of Quill's story. He has a second chance at love. We wanted to see that happen. Even a plot arc where we see Quill and Nebula find love would have been something compelling.Or what about the next chapter in his evolution? We know now that he's half God... Does he still have some access to the extraordinary powers he tapped into in the last volume? Powers that he could use to... Oh I don't know... Guard the Galaxy?No. Instead we get an incredibly boring story about Rocket, a character I can't even force myself to care about.And of course, this movie suffers from an incredibly boring villain. Once again we are introduced to a villain who is so obscenely evil that he feels totally flat and unbelievable. Animal cruelty? Xenocide? Not a single personality trait beyond megalomania, narcissism, and psychopathy. *Yawn""On the end of the day we're left with a movie that has no emotional weight at all. And it doesn't even have the decency to be fun or funny.They were even scraping the barrel in terms of the soundtrack. It feels like a franchise that has run out of steam. What a sad send-off.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Reviews_of_the_Dead","7 August 2023","This was a movie that Jaime and I wanted to see in the theater, but with an infant was difficult to find the time. When I saw this was streaming on Disney+, we watched it over the weekend since this is a long movie. Jaime isn't necessarily into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Guardians of the Galaxy is a series she liked before me.For this, we are picking up where the last events of Guardians of the Galaxy: Christmas Special as well as Avengers: Endgame. We know that Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is alive but doesn't remember anything of her time with the Guardians. This bums out Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt). I should say that the Guardians' current line-up is Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Drax (Dave Bautista), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Groot (Vin Diesel) and Peter.This movie explores the history of Rocket. He was created by The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) and his group. There is a heartbreaking story as Rocket gains awareness and makes friends with other similar creatures. When he learns that he is to be disposed of, Rocket decides to free his friends and himself. The problem is that The High Evolutionary anticipated that. This partially explains why Rocket is as bitter with life as he is.We also get to meet another interesting character of Adam Warlock (Will Poulter). He's the son of Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki). He is there to take Rocket back to The High Evolutionary. Things don't go as planned though and we see how ruthless our new villain is.That is where I'm going to stop with my recap as this has a lot going on in it. This runs two and half hours, clocking in as one of the longer non-Avengers films in the MCU. I understand why. This movie is fun while also pulling at the heartstrings. There might be a few times that I legit had tears. It is surprising to do for a movie like this. I'm not sure that's happened since watching Endgame so kudos there. There are also major shake-ups here for this group going forward so it needed to be longer as well.Let me then go over to the filmmaking. This is as you would expect, a CGI fest. This has Disney money though so it looks good. We get epic battle scenes. That's one thing James Gunn can do. They use slow-motion quite a bit. I could have used less there. While watching it, I get why though. There are so many members of the group that is the best way to showcase them. I'm glad what they do here to bridge the gap to the next film. Another key aspect to these movies is the soundtrack. This probably has the weakest of the scores, but that is still better than 90% of the movies in the MCU. I might even be undercutting my number there as well.What I'll say is if you're a fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy, see this movie. If you follow the MCU, see this movie. I'd even recommend it to non-fans of the series. This is just a great movie in my opinion. The best I've seen since Endgame for sure.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.","

He was scary he showed his power and most importantly killed people. All of the Guardian's had there time to shine but most importantly was Rocket. We got his tragic backstory that we got to see throughout the movie and even got to see him face off against The High Evolutionary near the end of the movie. Honestly everything was perfect.

I would have seen GOTG V3 but I watched spiderverse instead. Absolutely adore that movie and it's actually my favourite movie even though I watch a large variety and don't only indulge myself with the super hero genre. This isn't a review as much as it just me sharing how I felt but let me tell you; if you wanna watch something heartfelt yet entrancing and comedic, then this is the movie for you. I had to take a break from the movie when there was an hour left and not in particular because of the movie as such, but I cried the most I ever have in a long time. Rocket's story was so tragic yet deeply blissful. I got nervous and sad plenty in the final act thinking someone was going to die but thankfully no one did. I like it much better that way.

To access his facilities, Nebula (Karen Gillen) reaches out to Gamora (Zoe Saldana) for specialist help.Yes, I cried at the end. Not at any one particular aspect of the finish particularly, but more a sort of low-level emotional moments that tie up what feels like the end of a large section of the MCU, that ebbed and flowed as the perfect song was chosen, or the perfect reunion happens. There are two big levels of pain that GOTG3 is tasked with dealing with. Rockets trauma and survivors' guilt about the time he was experimented on, and Quill's inability to accept that his Gamora has gone, and the one still walking about doesn't love him. There were funny moments too, I should say, it's not one long cavalcade of misery.What it also is, is phenomenally good looking. I know that Feige has said that they're going to refocus on fewer/better films and one area where they can look to improve is the special effects, but for whatever reason this film, with several all-CGI characters, has entirely avoided that issue. I don't know if it's that Gunn is a stronger minded director than others, and refused the compromises, but it's certainly worth it.It's not, perhaps quite at the level of ""Infinity War"" or ""No Way Home"". It doesn't have fan servicing ability that either of those have - but it's a surprisingly dark and mature film and I enjoyed it a lot.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ycxsdhswjs","4 May 2023","I went in with mixed expectations. I'm a huge fan of the MCU; however, some of the phase 4 content had been disappointing. Guardian's of the galaxy volume 3, on the other hand, was one of Marvel's best productions yet! It had:Great character development through the exploration of a certain characters backstory.Hilarious interactions between the guardians thanks in part to the witty script writing.Emotion. Legit straight up emotion. I was sat in the seat feeling the highest of heights during the fantastic fight sequences and a mere moment later I'm almost in tears.In short:
Go and see this movie, you will not regret it!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dean-202","5 May 2023","Depressing, dark, with lame humour sprinkled in with ill fitting music jammed in at random. I can't recognize anything ""marvel"" about this. The tone, weak writing and CGI jammed down your throat all seems more like an audition to work for DC and their low quality entertainment, rather than any serious attempt to grow the Guardian's franchise. Gunn could have, and should have shaved 60 minutes from this 2 hour grim mess. I've no interest in seeing any further Gunn projects, especially if he continues making animal snuff films under a Marvel banner. This isn't a family movie, it's for people who think torture can be entertaining. No thanks, Marvel.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","marcotiero","4 May 2023","First things last: One reviewer scored this low because he ""casually went one afternoon"" on release day to see this, he claimed to have not seen the first 2 then wonders why he didn't know who any of the characters etc. What did you expect?There's also the guy who gave it 1 star ""temporarily"" because he's not seen it yet but all the reviews must be fake. The movie has a May 5th release date in the US but countries like the UK and New Zealand it was released on the third, so maybe you should take these things into account.Anyway, on with the review!This was a fantastic movie, and the positive reviews reflect this. It had everything you could want from a ""Guardians"" movie - Heart & soul, comedy, catchy tunes, fantastic action and visually stunning. It was a thrilling ride from start to finish and it was beautiful in IMAX 3D.One thing to add, though, is that it has more profanity than you'd usually expect in an MCU movie, which doesn't bother me but parents might want to be aware before taking their kids if this is an issue for them.","

I have to admit James Gunn did a good job writing and directing his final installment of the franchise for Marvel, but now after Guardians 3, I'm never gonna trust James Gunn again, after what he did to Henry Cavill and running for DC Universe, so nice try Mr. Gunn, lol!Anyways, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan and the rest of the cast and crew have done a beautiful job with there roles, and the story was so beautifully written with so much emotional stories to tell about Rocket, but I'm not gonna give anything away, so NO SPOILERS!I did cry 3 times in every moments, the humors were pretty funny, and the whole VFX was beautiful. But still, I wasn't ready to say goodbye to the Guardians of the Galaxy. It may be the end of the franchise, but wherever they are, or what Marvel is planning for the Guardians of the Galaxy ... a new journey, and a whole new adventure, and a new story... has just begun.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","smaniatopoulos","6 August 2023","Marvel has pretty much destroyed or abandoned each and every one of its properties or replaced them with mediocrities.The Guardians survived the demise of Thanos and so we got a third movie that nobody really expected or necessarily wanted, considering the second one was not any good and the Guardians had been overexposed in the Avenger movies, so it rather seemed like there no longer was any purpose for one more space opera.Thankfully, Mr Gunn decided that he needs closure before he moved on to the DC Universe, so he got to write and direct the 3rd movie, focusing on the origins of Rocket Rackoon and the famous Marvel villain known as the High Evolutionary.And basically he nailed it.This is in my book the best of the Guardians trilogy, even better than the first one. It is flawless. Yes, there is (as always) a lot of action but it perfectly fits the plot and this time you care, especially since every action scene becomes a plot device to move the story forward. And although in the last few scenes most of the action clichés expected in this sort of movie become prevalent, the excellent script, the very touching and humane story and the wonderfully depicted characters take precedence from the action and make Guardians an excellent scifi movie and one of the best space operas (if not the best) ever made.This movie is Marvel's last chance to redeem itself from the catastrophic period it entered after the end of the Avengers and it should focus on these characters going forward. All its other properties seem totally irrelevant, indifferent and abused to sell politics and create social platforms.This is the only decent movie they have released in 4 years, and they should focus on movie making. It's a real shame that the same people who can create masterpieces like Guardians 3 are wasted on artless and horrible creations such as Antman 3, Dr Strange 2 and all the pseudo-progressive tv series of the past few years.It may be time they seriously consider bringing mr Gunn back from DC and giving him the helm. These days it seems like all Mr Feige cares about is a future career in politics.If they don't find a way to replicate the triumph of storytelling and inspiration that Guardians 3 is, this movie may very well be Marvel's swan song.","

A truly heartfelt rendition by James Gunn has nibbled a bit of my heart in a corner. Rocket truly deserved his story be told to us and this was a genuinely beautiful way of doing it. I hope Marvel keeps making stories this good in the years to come and give them the proper time to be developed instead of rushing them out of the door for the next quarterly board meeting.Nothing more to say.Performance was great. Story was beautifully executed. This is what happens when artists work on a piece on their own.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","osecco-16354","5 May 2023","The first Guardians of the Galaxy really surprised me and I loved the movie (so much it was my top favourite Marvel until No Way Home), and the second wasn't as great but still enjoyed it. This one made me feel.... Really let down and wanting more.I did enjoy the more serious tone in parts - especially how Quill felt more like an anti-hero and hardened from all his losses, Nebula and Rocket were very well written, and how it felt like genuine closure for many of the characters stories, but for me that was kind of it.First it felt like the characters, specially Drax/Nebula/Mantis didn't like each other for most of the film (which was strange as the whole thing is set up to be protecting one of their own) and Adam Warlock was SUPER underwhelming - really felt more his whole point of existence was to save Quill in the end. And I get they wanted to make Drax more of a parent in this film, but I felt like Gamora in the sense they wanted the old Drax gone and made him knew to the point he's a whole new character. I'm also not sure how to feel about Gamora's plot; I liked her roughness but also felt she was too angsty and didn't like anyone; but also Quill felt a little similar to that in Guardians 1, so maybe to show how the ravagers affected them and their childhood traumas.The humour was definitely different too, but was unsure how much of it was genuinely funny or not. Also the amount of fake out deaths (like seriously both Drax and Nebula should have died more than once but are miraculously healed scenes later) was really strange, cause James Gunn is a great writer where that isn't needed. The soundtrack was good for the most part, but where in between kidnapping Kevin Bacon and Tony Stark's funeral did Quill learn about ""Creep"" but more importantly ""The Dog Days are Over""? Do not get me wrong I adore both Radiohead and Florence Welsh but it felt like my own spotify shuffle going from 90's to 70's to 80's to 2000's....I will say too - the multiple shots of animal abuse was definitely not needed. I get Rocket had a super traumatic upbringing, but seeing animals with robotic parts or destroyed in a chamber felt very excessive. IDK why we needed about 5 different flashbacks of it but I genuinely felt like I couldn't sit through the rest of the movie after the 2nd scene. I think it should be more discussed in reviews that happens as it can be triggering for young kids and even some adults.","

A perfect way to send off characters we've grown to love and adore over most of the last decade.It could have easily been by-the-numbers but it has real emotional depth, adds some great new characters in, but most importantly gives the characters a proper end to their arcs.You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll think ""No!"" and ""Yes!"" Naturally the soundtrack adds a lot too - similar to the last two Guardians film, it's an eclectic mix of music - some of which really hits the spot.So yeah.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","fredschaefer-406-623204","7 May 2023","When it arrived nine years ago, James Gunn's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY instantly became one the most popular films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The premise of a ragtag gang of super powered beings coming together and becoming reluctant heroes really struck a chord with comic fans and even those who were casual super hero film followers. The film had distinctive characters, and a lot of humor driven by the uniqueness of these heroes and their sharp edged personalities which were vividly rendered by some perfect casting choices. And a great soundtrack filled some of the best singles of the '70s was an added bonus. There had been some banger comic book films before GOTG, THE DARK KNIGHT and CAPTAIN AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER being among the best, but GUARDIANS had a real sense of fun, and a lot of heart. I think this was mainly due to director and writer Gunn, who took a group of heroes that many die hard Marvel fans would have had a hard time placing in the comic universe and making them superstars. The follow up, subtitled Vol. 2, fell short of the bar set by the original, but it still had a lot going for it. I didn't like the way they used Kurt Russell (they didn't give him a scene with Sylvester Stallone so we could have had a TANGO AND CASH reunion), but they did allow Michael Rooker's Yondu to shine.Now, six years after the last installment in the franchise, we finally get Volume 3. Peter Quill is mourning the loss of Gamora, and drinking too much, while the rest of the Guardians seem to be in a similar funk as being heroes in the post ENDGAME MCU has taken a toll. This torpor comes to an abrupt end when they are attacked by Adam Warlock, a minion of The High Evolutionary, who is revealed to be Rocket Raccoon's creator, and now wants him back, or to be more precise, wants his evolved brain back. Warlock is driven off temporarily, but Rocket is left near death. His team mates must now find a way to save him, and in the process, confront The High Evolutionary and his plan to build a counter-Earth by constantly experimenting on lower life forms to create a ""perfect"" race. Think of The Planet of Dr. Moreau.At two and a half hours, there's a lot going on in GOTG Vol. 3, including Peter's attempt to jump start a romance with an alternate universe version of Gamora who doesn't remember him. But the heart of the film is Rocket's story, or more to the point, his back story, which is revealed in flashbacks. Animal experimentation and vivisection are featured prominently, along with the genocide of The High Evolutionary's failed experiments. This is a dark turn, one tinged with true sadness as we understand Rocket's pain and loss. I think this tricky change in tone works, mainly because James Gunn is a very good director of this kind of material, and he has done the work necessary to earn a proper payoff. Gunn also stages some good action scenes, especially a confrontation in a hallway at The High Evolutionary's HQ between an army of his minions and the Guardians where the latter cut loose in a way that reminds us of why they are such a lethal force to deal with when the chips are down. There's good use of CGI to create a cosmic level comic story, including some neat looking monsters, even if other worlds like Knowhere are starting to have an awfully familiar look to them. Though much of the attention is on Rocket and Peter, Drax, Mantis, Nebula, and Groot all have their moments that remind us why they are fan favorites. One of the most important elements in any comic adaptation is the villain, and thankfully Chukudi Iwuji's High Evolutionary goes above and beyond. His bad guy is an old style megalomaniac mad scientist right out of a horror film with no effort to make him ""relatable."" And the reveal of his final appearance, when we see the damage Rocket has done to his face, is truly a horror moment; one of the reasons why GOTG Vol. 3 may not be suitable for younger kids. Another thing I liked about this installment in the franchise is that it is pretty much free of any social or political agenda, something that can't be said about other recent MCU films. It's refreshing that the fate of the universe doesn't depend on a teenage girl for once. Gamora, Nebula, and Mantis, are bad ass female characters, but they are also allowed to be flawed and funny.GOTG Vol. 3 does have its faults. My biggest gripe is the way they used the character of Adam Warlock, who is a big heavy hitter in the Marvel comic universe, but he could have easily been cut out of this story entirely and replaced with a minor villain. As I said, some of the CGI does not impress that much anymore, and it is overlong, though the pacing makes up for it. All in all, I did not walk out of this final Guardians film with any sense of disappointment, something I can't say for the last three MCU films-THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER, WAKANDA FOREVER, and QUANTAMANIA. That I chalk up to James Gunn, who is departing for the DCEU, where hopefully his talents will be put to use reviving Superman, Batman, and a whole host of other iconic superheroes. But he leaves behind a sputtering MCU, which appears to be going nowhere from a lack of direction and bad writing. All of this squandering the good will of many diehard fans like myself. Though GOTG Vol. 3 is promoted as the ""last ride"" of the Guardians, the mid credits and final credit scenes promise their return. I'd be up for a project that centered on Will Poulter's Adam Warlock, one that did justice to Jim Starlin's creation, but I'm not so sure I want to see Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Karan Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn, the voice work of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel return in their super hero alter egos without James Gunn at the helm. Maybe the three GOTG films should be left to stand alone as one of the strongest pillars of the MCU, but if there is more money to be squeezed out of it by Disney/Marvel, then sadly, that is what will probably happen.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","JacuzziEdits","3 May 2023","I believe that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is not only the best MCU film since ""Endgame"", but it's actually the best MCU film to date. I simply cannot understand why someone thought it was a good idea to fire James Gunn. It was a foolish decision. Gunn's creative vision and direction made this film an absolute masterpiece. The decision not to kill off any relevant characters was a smart one. It left everyone scattered throughout the galaxy, with each character on their own journey. For example, Peter is back on Earth with his grandpa. The High Evolutionary was a great villain and was perfectly suited to the storyline. This film was so emotional that it moved some viewers to tears, which is a testament to its quality.We now have a new team, consisting of Rocket, Adam, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, and a female character whose name I do not know. I hope that we do not get a ""GOTG Vol. 4"" without James Gunn, as he is the only one who could write and direct a worthy follow-up to this perfect trilogy. The post-credit scene hinted that Star-Lord will return, which is sure to excite fans. I hope that we get to see an emotional scene in ""Avengers: The Kang Dynasty"" or ""Secret Wars"" where all of the Guardians (OG) reunite in a beautiful moment.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","BandSAboutMovies","6 May 2023","I'm predisposed toward liking this movie.Let me tell you why.James Gunn did things the video store way, starting his career at Troma, where he made Tromeo and Juliet. He moved on to writing the Scooby Doo movies and the Dawn of the Dead remake before making Slither. But he's always had comic book aspirations from early films like The Specials and Super. The adaptions he's made so far have been smaller affairs, starting with Guardians of the Galaxy.The Guardians are the kind of characters that not that many people were aware of before the movies. The characters come from the kind of books you once found in quarter bins. Starlord was first in Marvel Preview #4 in January 1976 with Rocket Racoon appearing three issues later before not being used again until May 1982's The Incredible Hulk #271. In the first thirty years of their existence, Starlord rarely appeared and Rocket only was in ten comic books.The Guardians were the same way, first showing up all the way back in the January 1969 Marvel Super-Heroes #16. Roy Thomas said, ""Guardians of the Galaxy started out as an idea of mine: about super-guerrillas fighting against Russians and Red Chinese who had taken over and divided the USA. I got a sort of general approval from Stan Lee and gave the idea to Arnold Drake, since I had not time to write and research it. Arnold went in for a conference with Stan, and Stan (maybe Arnold, too) decided to change it to an interplanetary situation. All the characters and situations in Guardians were created by Arnold and/or Stan.""They appeared every once every few years but didn't really take hold until June 1990. That's when Jim Valentino created the Guardians that I've always loved. Few of them are in these movies -- Martinex shows up in a cameo, Yondu is a lot different -- but that series was one of the true joys of the grim and gritty early 1990s.Then, in 2008, following the Annihilation: Conquest series, we got the Guardians team that led to the film series, which wow, was a gamble.The Guardian movies changed the idea of what the Marvel Cinematic Universe was all about. Instead of do gooders, the Guardians were space pirates, the children of world killing final bosses and scarred survivors of worlds destroyed, the last of their kind. And yet, the films had a comedic tone that inspired the Thor movies and gave the Avengers films some comedic lift.So here we are with Gunn's last movie before leaving to lead another attempt at DC movies. And throughout the ads for this movie, the hype and even the film itself, it has the feel of Lando in Return of the Jedi, constantly feeling like someone is going to die and you're going to lose that character forever.The fact that this movie has those stakes and you have those feelings points to its strength.I've also been thinking about how no one wants to be challenged by art any longer. Now, go with me on this, even if you don't believe that comic book movies are cinema. I believe they are and that comics are no different than mythology or any heroic myth.Tonight during The Last Drive-In, the Twitter audience was complaining that one of the two selections, Tigers Are Not Afraid, was too dark and they couldn't make jokes and fun of the movie. Playing Mystery Science Theater 3000 is not why I watch movies. Nor is needing a support group and being there for one another during troubling movies. Movies should push your emotions.A lot of criticism directed against Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 lies in its tone. There are children enslaved by the High Evolutionary, who also figures into the origin of Rocket, tearing him apart and rebuilding him into the cybernetic cynical creature that he has become.And let me tell you, there are moments in that origin that are harrowing and in no way for kids. But the fact that they can push our emotions and make us notice those narratives shifts, well...isn't that what great movies should do?This is the kind of movie that can have a spaceship that has been made out of the severed head of a dead space god; a talking Russian cosmodog with mental powers; that has a world called Counter-Earth filled with animal people and all the problems of our world; and also one that finds each of the Guardians with very real issues: Starlord (Chris Pratt) has fallen into a drunken stupor after the double loss -- once in death, another as she was reborn as a being that does not remember him -- of Gamora (Zoe Saldana ); Nebula (Karen Gillan) making the grand journey from unstoppable amoral killing machine into the person responsible for the lives of the misfits that live inside Knowhere; Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista, as always, growing as an actor) also making growth from killer to father, the role he was always meant for; Mantis (Pom Klementieff) dreaming of a better life; Groot (Vin Diesel) communicating with just three words; even Kraglin (Sean Gunn) trying to assume the mantle of leadership that Yondu left to him.The movie gets going when Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), the creation of first movie villain Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), blasts into Knowhere and nearly kills Rocket, whose body is made of machine code that doesn't allow him to be healed. To save their friend, the Guardians make a deal with the devil -- Gamora -- and track down who created Rocket, even if it means they have to fly into what looks for all intents and purposes to be a space butthole.Despite being fired -- that social story about Gunn was always wrong -- Gunn would come back for this last story, telling The Hollywood Reporter, """"In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula -- and some of the other forthcoming heroes -- goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit.""And that's why I loved this movie.Yes, it's dark. Yes, the tone shifts a lot. Yes, it's overstuffed with ideas.But why is that a bad thing?Maybe we need to be challenged.A few other random things I enjoyed:The music: I usually make fun of needledrop moments in movies, but that's often because they're so obvious. Instead, this movie features some songs I genuinely love in moments that they truly fit: Faith No More's ""We Care a Lot,"" Spacehog's ""In the Meantime,"" The Replacements' ""I Will Dare,"" Alice Cooper's cover of the vaudeville song ""I'm Always Chasing Rainbows"" are all absolutely the right songs at the right time, topped by the Adrian Belew mention in the credits scenes.The end: I don't want to give anything away, but after an entire movie of those Lando moments, the feeling as ""Dogs Days Are Over"" plays are so uplifting that it makes the entire film cathartic. You go through the darkness to find the light.The deep Marvel characters: Beyond Sylvester Stallone returning as Starhawk, there's also Martinex (Michael Rosenbaum), Mainframe (Tara Strong instead of Miley Cyrus), Howard the Duck (Seth Green), The Broker (Christopher Fairbank) from the first movie, Bzermikitokolok (Rhett Miller from The Old 97s), Phylla (the daughter of Captain Mar-Vell in the Marvel comics; she's the young girl fighting alongside the new Guardians in the end credits) and Lem sorcerer Krugarr.Finally, a bad guy you can hate: Gunn and Chukwudi Iwuji worked to make the High Evolutionary a character with nothing redeeming or sad about him. Instead, he's near pure evil, a scientist who sees every creation as expendable, but shocked that Rocket, a throwaway creation, was somehow smarter than him.Also: this has the first f-bomb in MCU history, a ""The Legendary Star-Lord will return"" credit that reminded me of when they did that at the end of every James Bond movie and a gunfight sequence with Groot and Starlord that felt like John Woo within the MCU.And finally: When Rocket realizes what the High Evolutionary has done, as he screams in utter despair, only to finally see the sky moments later, wow. Just wow. That's why I go to the movies.","

Louder isn't better and it doesn't add to the story or experience. The story isn't bad but it is held back with the modern Marvel Studios decisions to make every battle more 'epic' than the last. More people, faster spinning, louder noise and rinse and repeat with 10% more for each battle. Acting was alright, story was alright, soundtrack was solid enough, designs were good but sped up to blur and volume raised to pounding distracted rather than complemented.

I have not watched the other ones (or any Marvel film) started them but wasn't captivated so never finished them so I didn't followed the storyline. Still I had no problem enjoying this movie on it's own. It's such an emotional film and that's what I wasn't expecting at all from a Marvel movie. I cared for the characters, in this one the storyline of Rocket is central and we follow along his journey where he came from and how it ties with the threat they (the guardians) have to face right now. As a animal lover, this hit me right in the feels. Loved the message it brought across. Also the music is so good and gives a light touch to the whole somewhat emotional ride. Loved the humor, the witty banter between the characters and I was just entertained the whole time. So even for the non Marvel or Guardians of the galaxy fans, this is such a recommendation. The rating is so deserved and I'm so glad I gave it a chance and pressed 'play'.","

HOWEVER, I'm very sad to say I did not like it and felt extremely let down...and it's James Gunn and what he did so amazingly well in the first two films that is to blame. I enjoyed the first 2 so much that changing gears so dramatically just did me in. Whatever special sauce that went into the first 2 movies that made me feel so good was so glaringly withheld from Volume 3 that it just left me feeling empty.The first two movies have the perfect balance of laughs, intensity, and music. It never went too far in any one direction. This movie on the contrary is dark...very dark...and it overshadows the feel of the film from beginning to end. After the first 20 minutes I thought, ""Boy I hope the rest of the movie isn't like this."" - but it was. Oh man was it ever. The tone of this movie is just so overwhelmingly different this time around. Gone is that ""fun"" teamwork feel that we've come to love so much. Gone is the crafty decision to not take the whole thing too seriously.One of the film's biggest ironies is that even though they go to such great lengths diving into Rocket's back story that you actually miss out on enjoying the fun, wise-cracking, kick-ass character from the first 2 films because that persona is completely missing in Volume 3.There are those occasions in film when the director breaks a very crucial, yet unspoken rule about a viewer's emotional bond and affinity with the characters. By choosing to not reunite Peter and Gamora (in what would have been a magical note to end on), I believe many viewers will be left unsatisfied. (And yes it is important sometimes to give the viewer what they want - especially if they have already been on this rollercoaster for so many years now.) Yes, I realize Gamora has no memory of her past but this film teased us with opportunities for a rekindled romance. To not bring them back together to me, was a crime.I'm bummed out for my kids. They loved the first 2 movies and could handle the killing and violence pretty well because many times James Gunn brilliantly made killing bad guys FUNNY. There's no way on earth they could watch this movie. It's got too much sadness, too much torture, too much emotional damage, and it has parts that are just plain gross - like almost horror movie type grossness.And what happened to the great music from the first 2 movies? Volume 3 has a few good songs but it's nowhere near the caliber of the first 2. Not even close.Lastly, this movie is at least 30 minutes too long. I felt like the big ship (or whatever that thing was of the High Evolutionary) was on fire for the last half of the movie. The film felt like it tried to end about 5 times.::sigh:: It's time for me to go back to watching Volumes 1 and 2. Like I said, Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad...","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dorMancyx","8 May 2023","What's difficult about ending a trilogy is how to depict a new journey without derailing from the given context, while having it distinct and memorable from the previous - The Russo brothers had done so in Civil War, Nolan too in Batman Rises, and James Gunn in Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3.Traversing their groundbreaking assemble in the first movie and the intergalactic flamboyance in the second, the Guardians finally arrived at their last ride together. Perhaps because it is his ultimate play in the MCU, James approached the film with a waywardly creative and almost selfishly stylish artistry, whether the greasy meatball planet, the earthly furry neighborhood, or the f-bomb-dropping dialogues. Despite its cartoonish settings, GoG3 is still unquestionably the best Marvel movie since Stage 4 due to its fascinating action sequences and poignant stories. With three major battles larger and larger of scale and intensity, the most mesmerizing combat has to be the hallway infiltration. Flawless choreography and one-take technique for starter, the scene fully showcases not only each Guardians' distinct abilities, but their fluent combos which takes me back to the airport showdown in Civil War. Moreover, the drone-like cinematography captures all aspects of the fight to their totality in swift and ingenious movements, even travelling through a penetrated wound. Jointing these battles are often joking interactions native to the GoG franchise, including out-of-context punchlines and dark humor. In juxtaposition to the laughter is Rocket's recollection, which thoroughly elicits the traumatic backstory of our adored mascot, making him one of my favorite Marvel characters once again. My only complaint for Gunn's peculiarly impeccable directing is the music: indeed, the success of Come And Get Your Love and Mr. Blue Sky is in the gene of GoG, but it doesn't mean that an entire film should be loaded with vintage tunes, and I would still like to have the Guardians' theme as the most prominent part of the music.(Spoilers Ahead!)For its curtain-falling purpose, the movie provides each Guardians with their spotlight moments: Warlock's childly curiosity contrasting his overwhelming prowess, Nebula's self-sacrificial resolve when protecting her family, Mantis' empathetic insight into those around her, Drax's heartwarming fatherhood towards the trapped children, Gamora's arc from inattentive to firmly abiding justice, and Peter's development from infatuated with one's past to pursuing himself... And yet, none of these could amount to James' obvious favorite, Rocket Raccoon. With his private storyline, Rocket's vanity, insecurity, and self-doubt are all reasoned as his tragedy gradually unravels: he habitually thieves and mechanizes because these two skills emancipated him from the most repulsive of hellholes, the place where his hopes were demolished twice (to live in High Evolutionary's utopian society and then to escape with his friends) and heart was impaled thrice (death of Lylla, Teefs, Floor). Bearing physical experiment harsher than Thanos' punishment to his daughter, Rocket could not bear to relive the pain of bereavement, which is why he treats those around him with vitriol and cynicism, pretending to sever oneself from genuine bonds. Another character worthy of discussion is the villain, High Evolutionary, a rare Marvel antagonist since Stage 4 that you can irredeemably hate. With little to none background given, the maniacal scientist was obsessed with inhumane bio-engineering to satiate his sense of godly accomplishment, which, when provoked by his own creation's excellence, sought to demonstrate dominion with the most personal assault. However, he was once again defeated by the animal, disfigured in specific, a near-rated-R, literal face-off. Instead of feeling traumatized, High Evolutionary went the other extreme, becoming even more deranged and motivated, just to ""perfect"" his life's failure. Again, an uncommon antagonist who's meant to be the center of abhorrence, and definitely a better villain to whatever variant of Kang it was in Quantumania.No other Marvel trilogy is as unique, complete, and unforgettable as the Guardians of the Galaxy, and I do not take objections for my statement. Honestly, I'm surprised by James Gunn's creative indefatigability especially in a downhill era for superhero movies, and I'm rather hopeful for his agenda concerning the DCU. For GoG3 in particular, it has been a long time since I felt the lingering taste of a movie upon exiting the theater: the throbbing of heart when rewinding a fight scene, the nasal acidity when sympathizing with a character, and the long exhale of relief after the credits roll when all the original Guardians rest aside each other. Thank you for the ride.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Silver5963","17 November 2023","The Perfect Trilogy is an elusive title. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man almost succeeded until Venom and Bully Maguire thwarted that. Lord of the Rings almost succeeded but threw it away at the end with it's painfully long goodbye scene and the plot hole regarding the eagles. However, we're finally looking at the pinnacle of cinema trilogies with the third movie in a set of brilliant films!Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 takes everything that worked about the first two films and expands on it. Everything hits, from the soundtrack to Rocket's backstory, and the addition of the new antagonists Adam Warlock (played humourously by Adam Poulter) and The High Evolutionary (played to perfection by Chukwudi Iwuji).Without giving too much away, this film is an emotional ride from start to finish, one of the best films I've seen. Kudos to James Gunn for giving us the one genuinely amazing superhero movie of 2023.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nufc_geordie","8 August 2023","GotG3 is the perfect mix of action, comedy, drama and Sci-Fi. It's also compelling emotionally however bizarre that maybe.Of all the movies in the MCU, the Guardians trilogy stands out for me because every installment has something the others don't, and that's heart. The cast is outstanding especially Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, and Dave Batista who is just brilliant in everything I've seen him do.This 3rd installment, as everything
in the MCU, has a ridiculous story and a lot of CGI but the true story behind all that is one of friendships, which we can all relate to. It does have a killer soundtrack and lots of laughs, which always helps. Highly recommended!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","rachelsmithliverpool","8 May 2023","Okay I will admit I cried 6x during this film. I thought the film was going to drag considering the last few marvel movies and the time they are on for, but this was a really nice surprise.Throughout the movie it was action packed with moments of comedy which were actually funny compared to some previous marvel attempts. The cast has been great throughout and I thought Bradley coppers voice acting was superb and it was really what made this movie.As for the villain!!!! Fantastic I hated him. Which is exactly what you want. It was perfectly acted and the backstory of rocket was something that was deeply disturbing and made you understand the character even more.A lovely ending.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ha77y73ad97","2 August 2023","Theres been a few instances post Endgame that shows Marvel that they can create movies that are worthy of the title of an MCU movie. This is certainly one of them! Spider-man No Way Home/ Shang-chi are the only ones in my eyes that live up to the hype, story and all of the fantastic moments that have come before in the MCU.Many times over i've been reading about the emotional damage that this movie brings on long-term MCU fans and it certainly packs a punch. 4 experimental beings, broken and tutored are still able to find meaning in their captivity bring the audience to tears with story that ultimately leads Rocket to finding his new family by the end of the first Guardians movie. Theres moments where a look from a Raccoon to a Blue cyborg that melt your heart as for years they were the only surviving members during the blip. All members of team have their time to shine in this movie as we trek across the galaxy.One of the most glaring points that have come out of recent marvel movies is that the villains are sub par, even with such talented actors like Christian Bale to name one they are not able to save the villains. Could be poor writing, could be poor direction or down to the fact that many of these were worked on during covid but thats no excuse when films like the Batman are written, filmed and released during the covid years. The High Evolutionary on the other hand is one of those villains thats going to go down in the history of the MCU, deranged, calm and manic at the same time his scientific process of creating beings to just throw away steers away from the recent bunch that have to have a motive behind the actions. He's just a bad guy! Same as the Green Goblin who yet again is still a standout from 00s to Spider-man No Way Home! He rips animals apart and rebuilds them to how he sees them evolving in grotesque hybrids of metal and living tissue.Only reason that this is not the 10 out of 10 is because of Adam Warlock, when he first crashed down to Knowhere that was the Warlock i thought we were getting throughout the movie! I know that many characters need a starting point to grow from but maybe it was a bit to far back for his start up. The thought behind him was to be closer to Visions introduction as a being who isnt able to process emotion but can work with whoever his master was. Instead we got a baby warlock, far more emotionally unstable than calculation.Its a Trilogy that walks right up there to the top of Marvel, Antman would have been there as well if it wasnt for Quantomania. We still have Iron man, Cap and this to be thankful in a way to round off a trilogy that has been with us for nearly a decade. I wish James Gunn well on the DC front and if a triology of Superman films can come out as well as these then DC fans are going to be in for a treat.","

Just one definite problem to solve and to solve it well. You empathize with the characters and feel that every member of the group is important. The quality of the action is high, but this is not the main part - action just supports the storytelling and characters. Good work, James Gunn. Best actor nominee may sound strangely but I'd like to give it to the Rocket.Funny sayings and incidents accompany all the activities as is the trademark of the Guardians.Can't skip to mention the soundtrack - Radiohead, Beastie Boys, Bruce Springsteen and so on.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","eitaishiguro","3 May 2023","Sorry if my English is bad.It came out in May 3rd in Japan and we were blessed with this masterpiece a bit earlier than the US.As my review title states, perfect conclusion to the perfect trilogy. This is most definitely one of the best superhero trilogy of all time behind ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. I honestly think they have completely different style so it is impossible to simply compare them but there is no doubt that this movie is a masterpiece in its own way.Although I've watched every MCU movie, after ""Endgame"" they gradually became dull and boring to the point I was watching solely by a force of habit. But this movie completely changed everything. I had my hopes up high and it did not let me down.Must watch for any Marvel fans, James gunn fan and genuinely anybody in search for a fun entertaining flick although I would reccomend
you to at least watch the previous 2 movies of the trilogy.Amazing. Thank you James Gunn.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nemesis2000-2","6 August 2023","To be honest I am disappointed I did not get a chance to see this in theaters. Just finished on Disney+ Guardians 3 IS one of the best MARVEL films and IS the best MARVEL film since Endgame.The story expands on the Guardians even more and does it without the comedy aspect overpowering the base narrative. All while carrying a steady pace between story, action, etc. Sadly a lot of the phase 4 MARVEL films and TV series went the route of comedy over narrative, and it shows. Here Guardians 3 includes the emotional aspect where it not only sticks with you but also has the factor where you can re-watch and enjoy seeing those moments again. I go back to re-watching the MCU in phase 1 through 3, but Phase 4 I have little interest in re-watching with the exception of a couple TV series. This does include some sensitive material, and may not be for everyone. Sensitive material is hard to watch, overcoming it to see where it goes I feel is a reward in itself here and Gunn delivered.Guardians 3 feels like the MARVEL producers, higher ups did not heavily influence it and let James Gunn do his work. If you are looking to get that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania taste gone I HIGHLY suggest watching Guardians 3.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","hasheerghafoor","5 May 2023","The best MCU film since ""No Way Home"". This film was about everything I wanted it to be. It was very emotional and deep in a much different manner then I expected. I teared up more then once while watching this film. This is without a doubt the best looking MCU film in a while. The cinematography is amazing! The CGI/green screen is excellent! I didn't detect a single flaw with what they were able to achieve in that category. The action sequences were very well executed, especially one where all the Guardians are fighting together and it looks like it's all one take. The flashbacks involving Rocket's past were very difficult to watch. Very emotional and dark. What made it work really well was not the voice acting but how they made Rocket look and how they treated him. The stakes were never higher in any other Guardians movie but this, which made the intensity and emotions all pay mush well together. The humor worked very well, which can be hard for a film that is very emotional. James Gunn's direction and style made it all work. As for flaws, I found the villian weak as I couldn't connect with him whatsoever. I just didn't care about him and found him pretty useless. Will Poulter plays Adam Warlock and he's very good. It's just that the character is extremely underutilized. I thought there would be a lot of him in this film but there's actually not and they didn't really know what they were doing with him. There's also some plot holes where exposition was required in certain scenes, which is never a good thing. Besides that, this was a really good movie that I absolutely enjoyed from start to end. It's also very fast paced. This film moves and not a single scene drags. Is it the best Guardians movie? I don't think so but it's still up there and one of the better MCU films we've had as of late.Letter Grade: B+","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","mazbutt-16041","3 May 2023","This is what we get when you give a writer and director creative control. Someone who actually cares about the story of characters and it's produced a near perfect conclusion to the GOTG.The darker tone of the movie is set early on and it instantly raises the stakes, however James Gunn doesn't forget to let us have fun along the way. I laughed a bunch and of course there was some comedy that didn't quite hit. And also, action scenes were outstanding!Some scenes in this are certainly disturbing and make you uncomfortable but its necessary and very much adds depth to the story and characters. Rocket, you have my respect Sir. His backstory is absolutely brilliant, i wish there was more.The movie fan in me gives this a 10/10 but if im being critical, it's a 9/10. Adam Warlock felt like a wasted opportunity and he was just THERE. I don't think they really knew what to do with him. Gamora's character has become difficult to do anything with but I appreciate what they tried here.A near perfect conclusion to the Guardians. You'll definitely be missed.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TxMike","14 September 2023","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, the picture is remarkably good and the surround sound really does surround you. If you have a decent or better home theater set-up.While the movie does focus quite a lot on action and explosions, seemingly the kinds that no one could survive, for me the best parts of the movie are the quieter scenes, the ones where the focus is more on the characters and how they relate to each other.We get a back-story for Rocket and how he was created. How he surprised at his natural intelligence and wisdom. And as the movie moves along Rocket's life is in danger and the Guardians have to scramble to save him.As with the others in the series this is just a popcorn movie at its core. It is for entertainment and for that it does very well.","

It will certainly be disturbing for some young kids.I was hoping for more Sly Stallone following on from his appearance in the last movie, but his screen time is about the same.There is a sequence in the middle, that totally took me out of the movie, and they do something I hate.

I have to put myself in a position to disagree with critics against the villain and his inherent evilness. There is but one criteria at play in the context of the Guardians. Healthy duality of crazy and defeatable. That's it, really.I will miss these discount Star Wars mascot freaks with my full raccoon heart.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Top_Dawg_Critic","5 May 2023","Of the three films, this one was the longest by far. I normally don't care how long a film is, as long as the story carries the runtime. But in this film's case, the story was dragged out with long and mostly unnecessary scenes. Much of the film was too much filler and not enough substance, and to make matters worse, most of that filler was overboard sappiness and cheesy dialogue with more misses than hits on the humor. It's like Gunn asked a bunch of fifth-graders to come up with the humor. That said, there were a few hits, but the infantile humor misses overshadowed the comedic moments that hit. Plus I felt the story wasn't as engaging as the first two instalments. Nevertheless, the S/VFX was outstanding, in abundance, and impressive, and the main reason for my generous 8/10, for a story and missed comedy that would've only deserved a 6/10.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","FKDZ","19 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is fitting and strong finale for a trilogy that managed to steal my heart. Putting on GoTG on a whim one day spiraled me into the next, and accompanying essential viewing namely Avengers Infinity war and Endgame. But none of them viewed on the big screen, until today, to top off the journey. This is adventure filled, funny and at times emotional and dark movie. There's something for everyone here. And I dare say it's even watchable for someone who hasn't seen a single marvel movie, because there are some short tit bits of info drops to either remind if you forgot, or to get you up to speed.Directing was fantastic. If I can describe it with one word it's: Dynamic. Maybe at times to a fault, with being to chaotic. I suffered only in one action scene from that but others complained a bit more. Personal taste. But there's so much creativity, not afraid to play with angles. One of the final fights (one take scene) is a joy to watch both in choreography and directing. I do have some gripes, I felt that the music and action scenes felt stronger in previous movies, not by much but it carried the music for longer and made the scene so much more fun. Here they tend to cut the music quickly. And moments just end a little too fast and don't get time to breathe.Story and characters, this isn't a useless trilogy, there's again real expansion on backstory and character progression. I love that the characters get a purpose, or find it. And we leave satisfied. The new side-villain teased in Vol.2 is alright, some good moments. But ultimately didn't live up that much to expectations. The main villain though, firstly, really well acted and a good villain overall. Also driven by his own madness, not just ''I want to take over the world'. No huge plot, but a plot that involved a important character. All characters are fantastic I just have no complaints really. Star Lord puts in the work, Drax is fun, Rocket is amazing. Groot is groot. The finale reminded me of Return of the Jedi, just how celebratory it was. It's a great way to really end a movie experience.Logic and stuff, well it's a fantasy movie so 99% of the unrealistic things I let slide. But if you are picky about that stuff you will notice. Personally I wasn't bothered.Music was great once again, another strong role in making this movie work and the trilogy. All good picks. Though as I said I felt like it was cut short sometimes. Whereas in previous movies it would really carry a scene for much longer.World design, production design. They went all out, from comedic designs to stunning interiors and areas. One of the reasons I love the GoTG trilogy so much is it's world. It feels classic, that kinda weird in-between of man with blue skin, woman with green skin. And full-on cgi monsters and weirdness. It also has that element of Star Wars and Star Trek in it. It just feels so good to watch a sci-fi world that is so creatively designed on a big screen.Whats next, who knows, the credits do tell us but I think it will be a while, or a different movie entirely. All I know is this trilogy was great. I enjoyed it a ton. The grade is mainly for nailing a trilogy. I'd say all 3 are very close together, with Vol.2 being a personal favorite for now.","

Some jokes are a bit cringey, others are really funny. The special effects are top notch, the retro soundtrack rocks and the interactions between the guadians will forever be entertaining.The villain however is really dull and the new Gamora just doesn't work for me. She's not a good replacement and her constant screaming in this oddly rough voice was laughable. Although this entry in the series was a fun ride it still doesn't compare to its two predecessors.All in all an ok sequel but it does seem like this should be the last one in the series.","

It had been a long time since I had seen such a pretentious film. It was a mistake to emphasize the relationships between the characters because the vast majority of them have irrational expectations and behavior; It was another mistake to put Rocket's drama as a catalyst for the film because the villain depends precisely on his relationship with Rocket and that makes any sense of danger disappear. The villain is unfortunately the weakest in Marvel history and he really looks like a jester. If you expect entertainment you will find a couple of moments to laugh (thanks to Mantis) and some interesting visuals. The rest can be said to be pretentious, unbearable, tedious and generally leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth. I rarely yelled at the good guys in a movie theater, Die!! Yesterday it happened This is not the way to make a worthy or valuable film. To put it simply: it's rubbish.","

Many films and TV wanted to indicate political correctness but did not finish their inborn missions. However, Guardians of the galaxy volume 3 did all them well. Particularly Rocket's story made me touched. I thought maybe Rocket's characterisation was the first three in marvel universe. Comparing with other elder super heroes, director Gunn used less time to portray Rocket's context. But he still accomplished this task. Other characters in the movie were also described wonderful. Only Mantis' denouement was a little abrupt. Incidentally, Gunn's bad taste was somewhat barro indeed.","

It felt rushed and strained credulity (even for a movie set in space with gadgets and creatures aplenty) somehow. Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind or sad that this is the final installment, plus the theater was crappy with poor sound. Hopefully upon rewatch I'll get on board.It was good to see the crew again and close the loop on some storylines. I definitely LOLed enough to embarrass my kids and the soundtrack was outstanding.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","CelluloidConnoisseur","5 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fantastic film that stands out as the best of the series. Director James Gunn manages to combine sweetness with viciousness to create a well-rounded movie that is both exciting and emotional. Despite the film being a bit overstuffed, it still provides a refreshing break from the post-Endgame slump in the franchise.Gunn's sadistic side is prominently featured in the movie, and it adds a layer of depth to the characters and storyline. However, the film is not without its flaws. It is a messy finale that can feel aimless at times, and the heavy themes of loss and terror can make it an odd, lumbering patchwork of a film.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an excellent addition to the series and a must-watch for fans of the films. It may not be for everyone, especially animal lovers, comic book fans, and those who are sticklers for narrative continuity, but for those who are open-minded and willing to take a chance on a unique movie, this is a film worth seeing.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","SnoopyStyle","15 May 2023","Peter Quill is depressed after losing his Gamora. The Guardians of the Galaxy are living in Knowhere when out of the blue, a golden warrior attacks it. Rocket is left near death and the only way to save him is to return to the beginning of his story. He and many others were the High Evolutionary's experiments in his mad quest for a superior society.The gang is back, but it's not as much fun. Peter is sad and then angry. Gamora is way angrier. Rocket's origin story is brutal. This series of movies has been more fun and ridiculous than other MCU. This is coming after some very crushing emotional journeys. It's an inflection point where this series needs to build itself back up. There are going to be some changes. Some are known to be leaving. This sequel still has its brand of humor, but the serious stuff is just more sad and more serious. I would like to throw a few more jokes especially with the Peter and Gamora story. I don't know why they try to ship Peter and Nebula, but that scene needs a joke. Nebula should definitely call Peter ugly or fat or pale or all of the above. I don't know what will Mantis do without Drax. This is supposed to be the end of a trilogy. Whatever comes next, I hope it's sillier and a lot more stupider.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","gdkvgf","6 May 2023","I'm not quite sure how a franchise that has knocked it out of the park to date (with one exception) could've messed up the formula this badly.Maybe I should've paid more attention to the writing on the wall after that one Christmas Special miss, but I just assumed that project was an easy paycheck and not a directional change.GotG3 starts weirdly and is super choppy throughout. On paper, the High Evolutionary storyline should've worked, but they spend far too much time away from it. The way they shoehorned Adam Warlock into the movie was almost criminal for a character that important.There's a lot more, but I don't want to accidentally do a spoiler review.It wasn't bad. But the flaws are so hard to ignore that I left the theater disappointed. If you're being honest, you did to.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Ed-from-HI","8 May 2023","WOW = Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is most certainly one of the very best Marvel movies ever produced (and that is saying a lot considering how impressive those recent Avengers and Black Panther films have been) but G of G volume 3 amazingly provides even more entertainment value and enjoyment containing all the expected irreverent humor & camaraderie + ultra-Cosmic action as before but with an extra-added dose of pathos and poignancy (inherent to Rocket Raccoon's intriguing origin Story) enhanced by a First-Rate Science fiction scenario featuring the 'High-Evolutionary' and Adam Warlock ( back in the Day when I seriously collected Marvel Comics many years ago, I always eagerly sought out any issues with appearances by Adam Warlock since he was one of Marvel's most profound, complex & conflicted characters.... and the High-Evolutionary comic stories never failed to fascinate).Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 perfectly blends all elements above and allows each Team member's uniquely eccentric strength (and humorously endearing misfit shortcomings) to be utilized to the fullest extent and perfectly incorporated into the overall proceedings. I was really surprised by how emotionally resonant Rocket Raccoon's origin Story is....... the scenes of Rocket 'bonding' and finding genuine compassion from the other intelligent, mutated-misfit, accelerated feral-creatures/ products of the High-Evolutionary's brutal experimentation, was so heartfelt and moving at times it was hard to believe these were CGI and not real breathing-living beings with actual Souls..... the voice and motion-capture actors should be nominated for Academy awards since their expressed emotions appeared so genuine!To balance the poignancy of Rocket's story the other Guardians especially Mantis, Nebula, Drax the Destroyer and Groot have a lot of characteristically idiosyncratic moments that are hilarious and help maintain the balance of 'light & dark' between the intervals of Fantastic action sequences. Another important note is that G of G Vol. 3 has some of the most Creative Starship designs and futuristic (and even psychedelic) technological concepts... some of the most impressive I have ever seen! To Top it all off the side-story of Quill/Star-Lord trying to emotionally re-connect with Gamora keeps the audience guessing all the way thru.... and the progression of that scenario although not what might be expected is still satisfying, nonetheless.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is highly-recommended, if I had one minor reservation it would be that I wish Adam Warlock could have embodied more of the complexity and profound depth of characterization from the original comics (especially the version augmented by Jim Starlin in the mid to late 1970's) but I am most certain Adam Warlock will appear in some future Marvel scenario since he has almost infinite story potential! I kind of hope the High-evolutionary will also return in some future form..... since these characters (along with the Silver Surfer) + the Guardians of the Galaxy (of course) really exemplify Cosmic Marvel Science-Fiction at it's very Best and most intriguing!","

People were actually walking out. Even the music was awful compared to the other 2 movies.There was no humour or laugh out loud parts. You would think they would want to go out on a high.Stallone was a bit of fresh air. The ending was okay. The best part when Peter returned to Earth at the end. The rest of the cast was a fill in there moments.Well a night out for Popcorn that was about it cause the movie didn't live up to the previous ones. Went out like a whimper nothing special.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ufster-2","8 August 2023","Aside from the usual Marvel formula of bantering camaraderie, heroic sacrifice, this movie tries to explore, both emotionally and intellectually, a basic idea of rights and worth, so far as life itself is concerned.At one point in the movie, angered by Nebula's shoving of Drax, Mantis screams ""You have no right to push him"" before she goes off to scold her for failing to understand that the worth of a life isn't measured on a scale of intellect or utility (competence).""It's all for a purpose""... At the beginning of the movie we see defenseless animals being tortured, killed and discarded like some lab equipment since this supposedly served a higher purpose of helping more worthy creatures to exist. There's no sugar coating here, it's what we do on a daily basis to many animals we arbitrarily decide have lesser worth thus should/could be used in service of higher life forms such as ourselves.It should come as no surprise, but with a thick odor of hypocrisy, that we see the poor Soviet dog (Cosmo based on the real life counterpart Laika) sent to her horrible death with the perfectly acceptable excuse that it served the advancement of mankind, much like the tens of thousands of animals tortured in much worse ways in the collective west up until that day.At the end, we see the arbitrary line of worthiness move towards much uncomfortably humanoid life forms as it has happened following the breakthrough years of the so-called enlightenment, the greater good of the selected few always being the go-to excuse of those with the power to inflict damage and destruction.The native americans, aboriginal peoples all had to make way to the ""superior"" white man in its quest for advancement and perfection. In this sense, the emotionally charged yet superficial exploration of animal rights begs a really important question.If we aren't to have any moral qualms over imposing our dominance over lesser beings on the grounds that they are ""less"" of what we deem worthy, what is the point of stopping at other human beings with similar characteristics for simply being classified as part of our species? There seems to be no objective line that could be crossed in this pursuit if this argument is to be accepted.Laika was a stray dog someone strapped on to a spacecraft, primarily because they could and because they deemed it to be necessary for the advancement of Soviet civilization. In the absence of a Laika, or in the instance that human subjects are easier and more reliable, I'm sure even any western nation pretending to be for human rights and individual freedom wouldn't hesitate to come to a similar conclusion. Oh right they have, many times... Tuskagee syphilis experiments, the American nuclear guinea pigs, countless other instances of psychological abuse in the name of experimentation, the list is endless.I hope this movie serves as a mainstream device of at least getting people to notice the very obvious link between treating animals as convenient utilities and treating humans as such. For all our pretentious moralistic grandstanding disguised in our fake self-righteous outrage, the intelligent among us realize there is no objective difference.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sye-88095","9 May 2023","As a big fun of Guardian franchise, I have to say this one is boring, annoying, and unnecessarily childish. I just wish to get out the theater halfway through the movie. Maybe the animal protection theme is the reason why it is rated so high. The movie can be easily made into a 90 minutes version. The constant shouting and anger serve no purpose but to annoy audiences. The comedy is at least two grades down from the previous series. To be fair, I think this one should be rated about the same as the latest Thor movie at around 6.5. But since so many people give such absurd high rating, I feel the need to balance it.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","stevendbeard","6 May 2023","I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, starring Chris Pratt-the Jurassic World movies, The Magnificent Seven_2016; Chukwudi Iwuji-Designated Survivor_tv, John Wick: Chapter 2; Will Poulter-Midsommar, We're the Millers; Zoe Saldana-the Avatar movies, the Star Trek movies and the voice of Bradley Cooper-A Star is Born_2018, the Hangover movies.This is the third and final Guardians movie, at least with this group of characters-there will be more Guardians movies, just with a different line up. Chris/Star_lord is trying to get over the death of Zoe from the Avengers Endgame movie when he learns that she is still be alive but has no memory of their time together. Will/Adam Warlock shows up, looking for Bradley/Rocket, and in the attempt to capture him, Bradley is badly injured. Will was sent by Chukwudi/The High Evolutionary for Bradley and during flashbacks, you learn more about Bradley's past and Chukwudi's experiments on Bradley and other unfortunate souls. This is a great send off for this group of Guardians. Lots of good action and fight scenes, a few cameos, lots of humor and there are 2 scenes at the end. One just as the end credits start-with a preview of the new line up-and one at the very end that shows a reunion for a character.It's rated PG-13 for violence, language and drug references and has a running time of 2 hours & 30 minutes.I really enjoyed this installment and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

Having seen it, I'm still not quite sure how I feel.The film is better than evrything else, film or TV, released ovwr phase 4 and 5. But still I found myself disappointed. The jokes, the constant arguing, the weird flesh planet... It all just tired me out this time.Rockets storyline does its best to save this movie, but with a very messy ending and too many random moments, it wasnt enough for me to enjoy it. He is the only character they seemingly cared to write a decent storyline for, everyone else feels like theyre just there by obligation.And Adam Warlock..... Dear lord. I dont see a point in saying it at this point but why adapt a character if thats what youre going to do? Literally unrecognisable and kind of insulting after all this time.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","onxpii","15 May 2023","I honestly dont get why i seem to be the only one who didnt think this movie was good especially being in a trilogy with 2 other great movies. It makes me wonder if others just like it because they have been so deprived of good marvel movies for these past 2 years or so. Yes, people are right when they say its one of the best marvel movies since endgame, but other than spiderman no way home, all other competition is bad cinema that isnt hard to beat.First of all, I didn't like that the medpacks were just now introduced. I dont remember ever seeing them before and I think they put them in just to have plot armor for every main character except rocket, just to what, enhance the already high stakes? We dont need to be spoon-fed the fact that rocket is in danger, we couldve completely understood that without it. Its pretty obvious that it is just a useless plot tool so the the writers can be lazy and have characters get into fights with no consequence on their health to be able to do another one right after. If youre going to write a story where you dont have time to include any injuries or deaths, then just dont let them get hurt in the first place??Secondly, since the main villain had these incredible powers capable of stopping all his guards who were pointing guns at him ready to shoot. If he was so powerful, how was he not able to stop the guardians when he confronted them? It seemed like he wasnt using the full potential of his power because the movie was already too long and the lazy predictable plot just HAD to have all the heroes beat him right? This is not the only time the plot has problems with lazily crunching important moments into a smaller timeframe; it can also be observed in the last few scenes where Quill is about to die then is saved in seconds and is COMPLETELY UNHARMED 1 MINUTE LATER! This could have been a sad death scene to naturally end an era, but no, they just had to add this for no reason just for him to end up leaving for earth anyways with his happy ending hero story because thats what always happens!!Finally, the villain is so one-sided, predictable, flat, and provokes no thought or moral conflict in the viewers minds at all whatsoever. It does not challenge your point of view on anything at all. Heroes good villain bad, hurt animal bad, hero always win. Marvel should know we are not little kids judging by the fact that they put in the F bomb and very disturbing scenes of animal cruelty. So, if marvel knows we can be adult enough for that, why are we not adult enough for a story that actually breaks the mold and makes the audience think?In conclusion, yes this movie was good for PHASE 4 (the worst phase ever!!) That does not mean it deserves to be called the best MCU movie by a lot of people. I really think people are overhyping it because they have been so deprived of above horrible content for so long that they think this is somehow a ""masterpiece"" in any way. They introduce new concepts as a lazy fix for their plot holes, make the villain not show his full power just for the point that the hero must always win even if it shouldnt be that easy, and show problems in the world (animal cruelty) without provoking any thought or change in perspective about it into the minds of the viewers at all. People need to take a step back from the hype and realize that hidden behind the tear-jerker backstory of Rocket is a movie that is objectively JUST AVERAGE...thank you for your time.","

A 7/10 is the average score I give and very few films in phases 1-3 dipped down to there. 4 years later, I am just happy that a Marvel film finally made what I thought their bare minimum was. Although the movie can be messy and tone deaf, it does not have a cringey agenda and is centered around a sub plot that has a lot of heart. It is not quite the send off these characters deserve but it is definitely the best they will get given the direction Marvel has gone and the lack of hype surrounding the property in 2023.","

I want to watch it again.You'll notice a tonal change between this and previous instalments. This one is darker (parents may want to view by themselves before bringing along their younger Marvel fans to see if they can handle it), the jokes aren't as frequent or as funny, and there are some more mature themes front and centre right from the first scene onward.And yet, so much of the familiar fun things you would expect are also present too. I won't say more about this for the sake of keeping this spoiler free.I wouldn't say this is my favourite GOTG film but that is not to say it is a bad film at all; it is more a testament to how highly I think of this trilogy as a whole and the care that was put into all three films. James Gunn loves these characters and you can really tell. I'm happy we can officially call this a great trilogy start to finish.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sbweightman","5 May 2023","A fantastic last ride for the Guardians with a film with pretty much everything you could want in it and which delivers on all fronts. The plot is simple but has a lot going on and manages to be light hearted and emotionally poignant with both massive and personal stakes. Each character gets their own chance to shine and the acting is top notch with a villain whose motives are authentic yet flawed. The special effects are superb with every scene filled with odd characters, colourful settings and weird alien-ness and the action scenes are fast paced, frequent and involving. Some scenes do go on a bit long and it does feel a bit like a music video at times due to the heavy use of music, but none of the scenes felt unnecessary and the music was great. It knows when to be fun, when to be serious, when to be funny with frequent jokes and when to bow out.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sujanfaster","8 May 2023","Most of the MARVEL movies post Avengers: Endgame have always lacked a bit of familiarity. A lot of factors like the introduction of new characters, concepts and new world building have contributed to the same. In the midst of all these chaos, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 brings a back that feeling of MARVEL which we were always hooked on to (see what I did there ;-))This movie was surrounded by controversies before its release due to the firing and rehiring of the franchise's mastermind director James Gunn. While James Gunn was working on it he was also parallely working on DC projects and he also took up a major role in DC recently. This has had me worried along with some of the MARVEL fans about his commitment towards the project. The way the Guardians get paired with Thor at the end of Avengers: Endgame I expected them to be a major part of the movie Thor Love and Thunder, but that wasn't the case. Even the Guardians' portrayal in that film kind of had us worrying on whether the MARVEL had lost that portrayal. But as soon as I saw the first trailer of GoTG Vol 3, I breathed a sigh of relief. The movie does exactly what it's promised in its trailer, that is, delivering on the emotional quotient along with a high octane fun ride.As seen in the trailer this story majorly involves around Rocket while also diving deep into the inner purpose of the individual characters. Even though the movie is almost 2h and 30 min long it doesn't seem too chaotic or also diverting anywhere from the main plot. There are some emotional flashback episodes which are very endearing to watch but I felt that they could have been placed more effectively. The action and action set pieces are on point and not a pain to watch unlike some of the recent MARVEL ventures. The movie excels in its production design department as always with a great play around colours. The music and background score for GoTG franchise has always been on point and this movie is no different.In case you haven't observed, one of James Gunn's strengths is his characters in movies. He has a very strong backstory to his main characters and for some of his side characters he provides cool, wacky and memorable moments. One can see the shades of Peacemaker and his Suicide Squad reboot in some of the characters' design in this movie. As highlighted before, this story majorly revolves around Rocket and we get to experience some great emotions through Rocket's POV in this film. Kudos to Bradley Cooper yet again for delivering a special performance. This makes you almost forget that the Rocket is voiced by a human, such is the integration. Chris Pratt's role as Starlord kind of starts shakily in this movie but picks up later to and gets a satisfying arc. Drax, Nebula and Mantis' roles are also quote high on emotions. While Groot has some cool moments in the movie, we don't really get to see the innocent fun which we had seen in the first 2 parts. Special mention to Sean Gunn's Kraglin role and performance, especially in the climax (I am not gonna reveal anything but I almost teared up in one of those scenes). I believe there has been a bit of talk about Adam Warlock's portrayal about how that character hasn't been utilized as per the comics. While I feel that role could have been written better, I also understand the restrictions in expanding that role because of movie's length. Zoe Saldana as the 'new Nebula' brings a different perspective and chemistry with the Guardians in this movie. Chukwudi Iwuji's antagonist character as The High Evolutionary is intense and fearsome but somehow misses the charm of a good MARVEL villain.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is definitely one of MARVEL's very few best post the Avengers: Endgame. I personally liked it better than the Spiderman: No Way Home. It is a great nostalgic treat to the MARVEL fans.","

The wise cracks, the characters the music and the Stella cast combined make it such an enjoyable film all the way through. The guardians now have a new headquarters, in the giant skull of a guardian giant. The team plan on getting gamora to rejoin them and in doing so something happens to rocket and so we get some interesting flashbacks, the show his life and how he came to be and the horrible experiments done to him and others. The guardians also have to contend with the guy that did the experiments and the new utopia that he has tried to create. As always great acting all around. It's nice to have the guardians back, plus the extras that now may join them. It's an emotional end to the trilogy and a great soundtrack to accompany it. Overall a very fun film and i hope Gunn can spin his hand at more fun.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","trinaboice","1 November 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
I'm a HUGE fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, so I've been looking forward to this grand finale. It pains me to even acknowledge that this is the last film in this series. Say it isn't so, James Gunn! He wrote and directed the film. At the beginning of the film, we see the lights turn off in Quill's bedroom, illustrating that James Gunn is putting this trilogy to bed. But surely, Marvel won't really retire this hugely successful part of the MCU, right???Here's how the studio describes this final installment: In Marvel Studios ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.THINGS I LIKED:
The fantastic cast includes our fan favorites: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Kementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter, Sylvester Stallone, Elizabeth Debicki, and more!The beginning of the movie starts on a sad, serious note, something I wasn't expecting.Lots of creative set pieces.Gunn does a great job blending tense action scenes with humor and heart.We get to find out Rocket Raccoon's origin story. Awwww...
It is said that many of the songs in the film are diegetic, which means the characters can hear the music.The song that opens and closes the trilogy is ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone. Sweet.Keep watching during the rolling credits at the end of the movie for another cute scene that references Kevin Bacon.As always, the soundtrack is terrific. The rest of the music by John Murphy was excellent.The story is extremely emotional. You WILL cry.We get a few short cameo performances from a few past characters. Yay! No spoilers!I always love the slow-motion action sequences. So entertaining.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie definitely assumes that you already know and love the characters, and understand how the Guardians' universe works. If you haven't seen any of the Guardians movies, you should absolutely not start with this one. Start from the beginning.Too many of the costumes and sets look like costumes and sets: more design than magic. In fact, this movie sets a new record for the most prosthetics (23,000) used on over 1000 actors.I wish the voice of Cosmo, the Spacedog, were different. It sounds too much like Mantis' character. The female voice by Maria Bakalova was used to pay tribute to Laika, the Russian dog who was one of the first animals in space.There are way too many characters to keep track of in this final installment.So much yelling.The movie is messy with tonal changes.There are a lot of flashbacks that might confuse the timeline for some viewers.Ultimately, I wanted more. Because I'm such a fan of the franchise, I really wanted to be blown away but wasn't. Were you? I need to see it again.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Some profanity and crude conversations, including an F-bomb
Violence
People and creatures die
Lots of destruction.!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","martingreen-71835","7 July 2023","A little darker than the first two instalments, possibly and maybe a little more grown up, but this is an absolute must see movie if you enjoyed the first two movies.The first movie was brilliant, the second movie maybe not quite as good as the first, but wow, the third movie in this trilogy is the best so far in my opinion.This movie, just like the others is visually stunning, but taken to a higher level. The plot is more intelligent without losing any of the humour, and as expected the impeccable music selection.This movie is full of action from start to finish.Do not miss this movie.....","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","tristanmilesheap","6 May 2023","Writing this as it's scoring arguably too highly at the moment and I don't want others big fans of the franchise to go in with high expectations that don't get met.The film is not nearly as good as the original, or even as good as the second. However, the closing 20 minute sequence is great, there's another nice soundtrack, and Rocket's story is the highlight of the film.The bad: the humour really doesn't hit anymore. There was flags in GOTG 2, but it all together doesn't work here. The same is true for the writing, it's not quite the same level.I also can't help but feel the magic is slightly gone. The original was something we loved that we didn't know we wanted, it just isn't recaptured here. It's also just quite a messy film, so much CGI of strange concept creatures and places that focus on quantity rather than quality.In my perspective, it's a continuation of the Phase 4 mediocreness that just can't capture the special something the Infinity Saga movies often had.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","filmtravel101","10 May 2023","I'm a big fan of GOTG 1+2 and thought this film would be an exciting experience but almost half of our group all agreed it was a flop of a disaster.The length of 2.5 hours was way too long for this bizarre Raccoon Rocket origin story that towards the end got so demented with the animal cruelty and Noah's arc analogy that it makes one wonder if James Gunn was smoking peyote or on some Amazonian Ayahuasca trip while writing it during Covid.It's a basic story that really lacks continuity and good storytelling and feels like a variety of music videos of best characters of GOTG tossed in with simple plot to save Rocket life - but instead it feels like a comical rescue relief that is endlessly pathetic - and the final ending kumbayah hugging fest says it all - and the only one that sees the entire film as a flop disaster is our green character Zoraya.What was James Gunn smoking ?We all felt like the villain crew that turned and mutinied against their stretched black faced villain leader - which is a good reference to how we all feel towards James Gunn destroying a great series with such a pathetic distorted story. Mutiny should have stopped this piece of garbage at the Marvel studio.Oh and most of the cgi is terrible unless you like Honey I shrunk the kids type of cgi - and the sound track was 50/50 missing it's mark compared to the last 2 films that were master pieces compared to this mangled motley of cringing sentimental garbage.Kudos to the space dog and please do not continue with any more.Looking forward to new films from James GunnPs o idea how anyone can give this film a 9/10 score4 stars and that is being generous.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","b_shaker333","7 May 2023","This is why you don't see many good movies anymore... this is why the Golden era of film is the 70's... 90's... and some big franchises came out in like the 80's.Because companies and their distributors get too afraid with ballooning movie budgets, and it creates a too many cooks in the kitchen atmosphere.And movie studios are just too nervous to take a risk, or they just make the same crap because it's guaranteed to make money.There is no art, there is no love or passion. It's just cold calculated money, and that's it.There's a reason there aren't many new generation directors... and even if there are talented people... they pretty much all do television. Because of control.This movie is BY FAR and away the best movie in the series... and the best Marvel movie... probably ever. And the reason is they just let the director do his thing. And it works... it will always work if that's what they do.But they rarely do... and this movie is proof positive what happens if the big wigs with no talent just step back and allow the artists to create art. Like they used to... in the 70's... some 80's... and the 90's. Thank you for a trip down memory lane James Gunn... DC should be in good hands... Disney is a bunch of morons.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","John_T_Chance","9 May 2023","Man ... the 100% truth is that they delivered a decent film yet it feels greater than its parts because Marvel Studios has been so lost and so poor since Endgame. Too little too late unfortunately. Box office aside, the movie plays exactly like a curtain call. Self indulgent but insisted upon by an appreciative audience. This sequel is not great, predictable and cliched but it all works. When a pleasant 7/10 movie feels massively refreshing then you know the bar isn't just low, it is on the ground. Overall, it's a fun and a worthy end. Take a bow folks because it's now officially all over for the MCU.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","DoctorDragon","8 May 2023","It's all about Rocket. That was a thing I never expected from this movie and I'm so happy about it. It was the most emotional and sad Marvel movie ever! Rocket's backstory is so dark and cruel that it's impossible not to cry buckets. From the start this movie felt defferent, with a threat never so high of characters dieing.In the end...nobody from the og team died. But is this a bad thing? No. The ending works fine exactly because of this. Instead of a funeral, similar to the second movie, we get a family ""split"". The child going out of home to live it's own life.This is such a beautiful message.I don't even have to talk about the music score...come on...it's magnificent.And the movie itself feels so organic, with drama alternating to comedy alternating to action.Such a great movie!!One last thing, the best quote from the movie: ""You didn't want to make things perfect, you just hated things the way they are."" ~Rocket Raccoon.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Benjamin-M-Weilert","21 September 2023","Ever since the original Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), it felt like this corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was left to do its own thing. These movies didn't have many cameos or connections to the larger MCU except for introducing characters who fought in the Avengers films. Perhaps because of this level of separation from the core MCU, the Guardians of the Galaxy movies have felt more stable tonally than the rest of the MCU films. You can probably thank James Gunn for that.While I consider the first Guardians movie to be one of the best superhero (or even sci-fi) films ever made, Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 (2017) diving into Peter Quill's (Chris Pratt) origins wasn't quite up to snuff. And while Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 (2023) is another origin story, it felt more impactful than its predecessor. After all, the one character of the group we didn't have any in-depth background on was Rocket (Bradley Cooper). This film remedies that in a way that's both emotional and a fitting cap on the adventures of the original Guardians group.In the post-Endgame MCU, movies like this feel rare. Sure, there's room for more adventures for this new group of Guardians, but wrapping up character arcs is a much more impressive feat. Letting things come to a natural end without forcing any hints of the next tie-in or cameo was refreshing. The villain also felt unique but threatening. It was also nice to get a more realistic resolution to the relationship between Peter and Gamora (Zoe Saldana)-kind of like at the end of Broadcast News (1987). Overall, the Guardians films are great by themselves, which Volume 3 epitomizes.A fitting and distinct wrap-up for the original Guardians, I give Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 4.0 stars out of 5.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nakrugt","4 May 2023","The first Guardians of the Galaxy movie was a surprise for the audience who were bored with the Marvel formula. It was fresh, it was fun, it was silly (in a good way). It was shocking.The chemistry among the characters was amazing, and we should be honest, that chemistry among did much of the heavy lifting in the second film, from which I do not remember much.With phase four, I was shocked how bad the writing was in each and every project - except for Spider-Man No Way Home. The rest was trash. That mentality left me concerned for the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3. I was afraid to see our beloved characters disrespected. Happily, I was wrong.There are plot holes, yes, but everything considered, it is fun to watch. Each and every character is given enough screen time for character development, which was non-existent in MCU phase 4. The flashbacks - a stale way to tell a story though it may be- work in the movie: we see the story of Rocket, and his origins. Is it a bit clisché? Yes, but it works.Nebula, I think, is amazing, too. They finally do justice with her in this film.You may not like the ending, they play a bit safe, but at least we leave the cinema with some optimism for each character in their own individual journeys.And yes, I think I am going to watch it again.Edit: After watching for the 5th time, why not nominating Chris Pratt for Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role?","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","eddie_baggins","5 May 2023","With a long time coming F-bomb, multiple scenes that are likely to make the kidlets (and more than its fair share of adults) cry and a direct reference to meth, Guardians of the Galaxy is most definitely back for one more team adventure delivered under the watchful eye of new DC cinematic universe maestro James Gunn who ensures that this Marvel series with a difference is able to go out on its own terms in this current format and in turn save the MCU from a string of dire to forgettable outings that have plagued the company since their Avenger's saga concluded with Endgame.Never more desperate for a feature that critics, audiences and box office results all were in favor for in unison since the dawn of the whole operation with 2008's Iron Man, the MCU should be thankful they allowed Gunn back behind the helm after showing him the door due to past misdemeanor's as Gunn and his cast clearly love working with one other and ensure that their shared love for their characters and the world they are a part of is one show here once more with Volume 3 of the Guardian's universe likely to please all that have enjoyed the prior two outings that have surprised all with their public affection and money making abilities.Arguably more serious minded in many respects, with Gunn not afraid to enter into some seriously dark and twisted territory across Volume 3's two and half hour runtime, it's nice to once more watch a MCU feature that feels entirely removed in most instances from previous events or trying to set up future mash-ups, team-up's or potential threats and in staying focused on itself Gunn is able to juggle the films heavy, light and playful tones to good effect, making this epic adventure one that never stays down for too long as we are carried across various set pieces and emotional undertakings.Using his same oddball charm and keen eye for visuals that have worked for him in the past both here and with his underappreciated Suicide Squad from the Covid-19 landscape, Gunn gives Marvel some of its best bang for buck moments in many a moon.Often backed by another rip-roaring soundtrack full of old school and more modern day jams, if audience's have paid the ticket price wanting to be entertained by spectacle and inventiveness they will get it here, while others wanting heart too go along with it all will be equally pleased (with Rocket's key backstory and arc playing a major role here), as will those more refined folk that perhaps just wanted to see a telekinetic dog or a brash golden boy in the form of Will Poulter's Adam Warlock cause some havoc along the way.Uninterested in messing with the formula or Marvel DNA like it arguably did with its first outing in 2014, Volume 3 leaves the series on a high note if many of the cast and crew decide to stick to their word and move on from what they started those many moons ago, succeeding against the odds and if this is indeed the last time we see this particular group of misfits, miscreants and outcasts on screen in this way, there's solid evidence to suggest that Gunn's three Marvel films are the most consistent of all of Marvel's properties in the cinematic cannon.Final Say -Rollicking along at a good pace across its substantial runtime and combining heart, laughter and spectacle together with a cast that are all seasoned and energetic professionals, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a (seemingly) fitting swansong to this ragtag crew that the world has understandably fallen in love with.4 mismanaged interrogations out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Mojo_Dog","8 July 2023","Let's have a real review on here to fight the pr marketing machine bot swarm.Im starting to believe this conspiracy theory:
The last marvel movies doesn't really have directors and editors. They have been replaced by AI.Love And Thunder, felt like an incoherent fever dream.Ant-Man Quantumania, felt like an incoherent fever dream.Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3, felt like an incoherent fever dream.Not completely unlike the result you get when asking ChatGPT write a story.I loved GotG 1 and 2. And most of Gunns previous work.Number 3 was... what the hell am I watching?Did Gunn really do this? I know he can do better.It's gotta be cut together with AI right?It's either that, or Gunn has lost his passion and gotten lazy or tired of pursuing his usual quality.It feels like watching a long trailer with no narrative weight at all.Nothing feels important. People die and come back like nothing.Sometimes people can survive in the vacuum of space, sometimes not, depends on what is needed of the story or if it's an important character.No coherence. The pacing is insanely fast. Emotional scene, yes very sad. SMASH CUT! Running and shooting!The iconic classic music does not fit at all to what happens in the movie, people even dance out of rhythm.There are ""funny scenes"" injected here and there with no thought, even when it does not make sense. The comedy is just forced this time around.Even acting was pretty bland. They didn't even try with the voice acting for young Rocket. At least Quill and Gamora had some chemistry.Ugh. But really though. I think it is time for the death of superhero movies. Every creator seem to have grown tired of it and is not putting passion into the movies anymore.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","demonblade-37792","8 May 2023","The first impressions of Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 gave me more emotions considering it is the last of the trilogy. It gave me laughter because the jokes were funnier compared to other Marvel movies. It gave me more sadness because there were parts where I thought a certain character that dies. This is also Rocket Raccoon's origin story because it will go more of in depth of how he will learn how to talk and learn more from Rocket's creators. James Gunn did a great job on ending GOTG considering he will move onto DC. The acting by everyone was amazing that makes the viewer feels all type of emotions from laughter to sadness. The cinematography is visually stunning, from the CGI and special effects, that makes you feel that you were in another universe. Lastly, the action was great from the Guardians that made the viewer want more fights. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is great with its acting, cinematography, action, and the story. I would recommend to watch it in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cherold","31 July 2023","GOTG has been the funniest and most rambunctious part of the MCU, so it's a little startling when the third movie begins with Rocket's deeply disturbing backstory, told in increasingly dark flashbacks as the Guardians try to save Rocket from imminent death.This bummer component takes the fun down a notch, but there's still a lot of humor and action, and the series is still able to keep the characters believable among the nonsense, which makes up for storytelling that sometimes ignores the fine points of telling us what's going on.This is very much an end-of-an-era film, and GOG3 does a good job at wrapping things up in a satisfying fashion. I have seen many movies spend a tedious 20 minutes of gauzy nostalgia for characters I don't care about, but this movie keeps it short and fun, giving each character a good send off without getting maudlin.While the first two were seamless wholes and this one is more a lot of great bits chaotically strung together, it's still lots of fun.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","JayWolfgramm","3 June 2023","After so many of the post ""Avengers: Endgame"" Marvel movies failing to impress, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a breath of fresh air. It definitely finds itself on the good end of the MCU power ranking. The fact that James Gunn writes and directs this entry as well helps give the trilogy a sense of cohesion that the other Marvel movies lack.This movie can be both very funny, like the other two, but also surprisingly dark and delightfully heartwarming. Some people may think that the MCU relies on comedy too much, that having comedic relief is in some way inheritably a bad thing. But such is not the case for James Gunn. This film is able to balance the humorous moments with the deeper parts much better than ""Thor: Love and Thunder"". That being said, there were a good portion of the jokes that just weren't all that funny, or if they were, they just lasted a little too long. None of them came at a time that diminished a sincere moment, but some just did not land well.I liked the villain's motivation and his connection with the Guardians. But the way he comes across in action is like a child throwing a temper tantrum. Every other scene he's screaming. It does help him become less likable. But trust me, this guy does not need any extra help with making him unlikable. He is absolutely despicable. He is definitely someone you have no qualms in wanting to see him fail.I enjoy how quickly the movie gets going. The main characters get their goal presented to them fairly quickly. The movie doesn't juggle too many different plot points, it is very straight forward with a clear objective from beginning to end.The movie does however cut to series of flashbacks. For a lot of people, they really enjoyed these scenes. I do agree that they add a lot of necessary heart and character to the present-day storyline. But with what we the audience know about the present; everyone knows exactly where this story is going. That can make the reveal a bit less passionate. I don't know, maybe I'm just heartless.I like a good ensemble cast, that is something that has always helped the Guardians and the X-Men, they have a good cast of diverse characters to work off of. Not all the characters have a compelling arc to go through, but they try. And every one of the main cast has a moment to shine.The soundtrack has always been an important part of the GotG franchise. Now that Starlord has a Zune, his playlist has expanded to include more contemporary music. Personally, this change didn't work for me. I am a huge fan of the oldies, and I felt that helped give the movies their identity. Not a huge thing, I just think that this soundtrack was the franchise's weakest.There are some character decisions that don't quite add up for me. At times characters will act like killing is something that they will never do, then the same character in the next scene will be killing dozens without hesitation.The action is well choreographed, particularly a fight scene towards the end, if you've seen the movie you know which one I'm talking about. The problem I have is that the characters never feel vulnerable. Characters will be shot, stabbed, decapitated, exploded, necks broken and will just hop up like nothing happened. One of the characters seems to be a mixture between the T-1000 and Silly Putty. That really takes out any suspense that any action scene may have when the characters seem to be invincible. Even the cool action scene, isn't a girt and grind fight. It is more of a: ""Look how cool our heroes are"" moment.Overall, it is a good movie. There are just a few things that hold me back from saying it is a great film. Some jokes go on too long. The music doesn't hit that hard. The emotional moments are too predictable. The villain comes across more annoying than threatening. And our heroes seem to be too unstoppable to make any action scene feel important. It is still a fun time, and for me, still the best Marvel movie in quite some time. If you are a fan of the Guardians, then go ahead and Come and get your love.","

In between the action there are tragic backstories, nostalgia kicks like Howard the Duck again and references like the Alf postcard at the ending. The visual effects team did it again with outstanding effects and the makeup team too that deserves a third run for the Oscars. And, such a shame there are no stuntman Oscars category yet. The movie is not just for the kids, but also the mature science fiction and action movie loving audience.

If these aren't signs of his talents then I don't know what is.Oftentimes the third entry in a trilogy is the worst, but I think it might be the opposite case here!I'm not joking, this movie had me in tears because I was either so sad or so happy!All of the characters are given a chance to shine!

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","kosmasp","10 May 2023","No pun(s) intended - and one of two things I was thinking of after I watched the movie. The other one will be my closing line on this review. This being the closing chapter (or volume as James Gunn likes to repeatedly tell us), everything is possible, right? So you will be watching this and have certain expectations ... maybe those will be fulfilled - but maybe not. And that is not just about finality - but also about resolving and resolutions.But let's get back to the beginning - actually we really go to the beginning. The beginning of Rocket - we will see him before he became the character we love now. I assume the story about his ... becoming/being made/born is being told in the comics too. I am quite certain there is a game where the story is being told. And while I knew about it (remembered most of it), it still stayed as emotional as people were saying all the time.The timeline - the way James Gunn edited the movie, is really fine. You may wonder if there even can be a Guardians movie without him at the helm ... the future will show us. The movie has it all - it plants and it sows. It has the humor you have been expecting it to have - and the characters are true to themselves. There are throwaway characters that get their moment to shine (looking at you carrot face), you have good boys and bad boys (and good boys being called bad boy - well you'll know when you watch the movie) ... and many other things. Oh and we get a lot of cameos - one I almost confused with Stan Lee. They are allowed to use his image now - but it was Lloyd Kaufman. Good for him and Gunn to have him in this. Also Howard the Duck and so many other people/characters, that you probably will spot - especially if you are into the comics.The movie I expected nothing from grew on me - and if you have no emotions at all after watching this - someone has to check your pulse. Kidding aside, this is a love letter to Science Fiction, to comedy - and it has the very first ""f""-word of the MCU ... one would expect it to come from Samuel L. Jackson .. but we get surprised (not just by this fact) ... and Chris Pratt is the one to utter it. And the great thing is, you may not even notice it - because it is just so fitting - the way it is delivered ... it just rolls of the tongue and the scene warrants it - it would have worked without it ... but I am not complaining they included it.Visual effects are good - something that many did complain about (rightfully mostly I reckon) in the previous movies. But it is the story that holds this together and makes us fall in love with everyone. Or to quote someone and bring my review to an end: I love you guys - another one you may not entirely notice, but a big moment! I am ... satisfied! To say the least.","

The dialogue was very angry and went on and on, how can it be for kids or even teens?, I really disliked the negativity by Gamora and the Manta girl. Only a rating given of 6 by me and what happened to the whoever chose the music? I only recognizes 2 tunes. Some good scenes were outnumbered by a bunch of mediocre ones. Chris Pratt was good and I liked the development of the background of a few characters like Rocket. Gaps in continuity and storyline too. Wait on this to come to Netflix!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","hemilia","3 May 2023","This movie became my favourite one the moment the lights in the movie hall turned on.Everything about it is just so good. The humour is top tier; the whole theater was laughing in unity. The imagery and sound system were amazing (I'm referring to the fact that you completely fell like you're part of the movie). The storyline is very exciting, I often found myself gripping the chair and it made my cry a few times.There are two things that especially stood out to me: the soundtrack (ofc, one of the main reasons why I love the GOTG series so much), and the evolution of the caracters. I loved how we could really see their development, which sometimes took me by a complete surprise and I didn't feel like there was something missing from the movie.All in all, thank you James Gunn and everyone for this masterpiece! If I had more money, I'd spend it all in the movies seeing this over and over again, because seeing it once is definitely not enough, you just wanna keep watching.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","moviemanmo973","6 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 gives audiences much of what it has given them in the previous installments.Once again the music is good and ties into the action sequences giving the scenes a bit more life. There are some good laughs in this film, personally the funniest was Dave Bautista. He doesn't deviate from what he has done in the previous films and I was always waiting for him to deliver his lines. There were some moments with other characters where the humor was forced but overall it felt organic.I enjoyed how Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana were able to display their chemistry even with their dynamic relationship. The rest of the guardians were great especially when it came to the action sequences. There are a couple tag team moments that were visually pleasing.The majority of this film focuses on Rocket and how he came to be. With the use of flashbacks his backstory is pieced together to give some emotional moments.All of the character designs are well put together except for some of the guards in a certain scene that look like they are just humans wearing weird bubble suits. The best character design by far was the main villain played by Chukwudi Iwuji. I really enjoyed his look and his story in this movie. Personally I wanted him to be more fierce considering he was the main villain. Sean Gunn who played Kraglin was another character I wanted more from although he wasn't disappointing.The one character that did disappoint was Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. I wouldn't blame Poulter, I felt he did what was asked of him as an actor. I put blame on the writers. Adam Warlock was an underwhelming character that only served as a very weak comic relief.His character arc was predictable and his scene involving Chris Pratt towards the end of the film was one of the weaker moments.Overall, I think this movie is just good. I would say it's just slightly above okay.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","danydarko-34609","8 July 2023","So given marvels recent few years of disappointments, endgame, Thor 4, Dr Strange 2 and Antman 3 I'm talking to you! I was as worried as most that the guardians final outing would possibly not live up to the greatness of volumes 1 & 2, especially given the delay with this last chapter due to Disney firing then rehiring James Gunn, proving once again how much of a mess they can make of things. However I am VERY happy to report, it's the BEST of the bunch! I don't really know where to start! It's got great action, the opening scene really kicks things off straight away! There's deep emotions on display particularly from Star Lord, but all get to show their fair share. And the comedy as usual is very funny and off the wall as with previous instalments. And finally as always yet again, the soundtrack rocks! James Gunn really has pulled out all the stops and gives the guardians the grand send off they all deserve. A word of warning tho to those wanting to show it to their young children, it does include marvels first f bomb, as well as some of the scenes are really quite dark which was surprising, but still great! Everyone in it gives great performances especially Adam warlock, although comic book fans may disagree with the direction of the character, I personally found him hilarious. The bad guy at times does border on the line of slightly of over acting occasionally but overall he's a good bad guy. It's bittersweet as it's the last guardians film but it is such a good final instalment, strongly confirming the guardians trilogy to be up there with some of the greats like the dark knight trilogy, Indiana jones, Star Wars etc. I've tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible but fans of Firefly will love a few cameos! Anyway hopefully I've encouraged enough of you that you will have a good time watching this, if you don't, then watch it again just incase there's anything you may have missed! I'm very much hoping this gets released on bluray in 3D as it looks incredible in 3D also! I truly congratulate James Gunn on producing such a unique and brilliantly entertaining trilogy. It's going to be a long time until we get another trilogy that is this consistent with its quality and brilliance. Wishing you and your families well and until next time, may the force be with you.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nickoleterrible","5 May 2023","I am sincerely surprised seeing all those good reviews . Honnestly it was bad. I didn't hear a single laugh for the whole movie, no ""wow"". It was dead silent. Saw couple of folks leaving.The funniest character of the guardians was there all along, but he was almost dead except for the last 10 minutes. Not a single line, no action for Rocket. Except when they were digging in his past, when he wasn't really Rocket. And those parts were so cheesy i was pretty close to leave.At least when Groot re-borned in the second movie it was funny seeing baby Groot. Here they left Rocket aside. It's like new guys wrote the script for this one cause it was completely different. It was a serious Guardian of the galaxy, no special bad-ass vibes we used to see.10 the first, 8 for the second, and only 2 for this one.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nolinger-48439","7 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fitting farewell to a fan-favorite group of heroes. It's great. It's action packed and funny, but also heartfelt. It does a great job of introducing us to Rocket's backstory, which contains some truly heartbreaking scenes. Its comedy works and is reminiscent of the first two movies. It also has a lot of great action scenes, the standout being the hallway scene. That scene alone was worth price of the ticket if you ack me. It was incredible.Another thing that deserves praise is the High Evolutionary. They did a great job with this villain. It's refreshing that they finally made a villain that the viewer could hate and not try to make another sympathetic villain like Thanos. They just went all out in making the High Evolutionary unlikable.I also appreciate that James Gunn managed to give everyone a satisfying arc at the end.Once again, James Gunn killed it. It saddens me that this is the last Guardians film, and that James Gunn is done with Marvel, but I also look forward to what he can do with DC.","

The soundtrack has more cool music, brings back all good and classic times. The only down part for me is some scenes felt slow but it didn't spoil it, you'll still love it, watching on the big screen feels so good and complimenting with the best sound system will make you fell like you're in a roller coaster ride!

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","critic_w","6 August 2023","It's okay. But here's the problem. These are suppose to be ""Super Hero"" films, but they all run short on ""hero."" You will be entertained. You will laugh, perhaps cry, and you'll certainly hate the villain. But without spoiling the story, the victorious cheers are rare. Remember when Quill got the orb on Morag in GotG V1? Remember when they broke out of the Kyln? Remember those victorious feelings. Well, you're gonna have to, because Marvel has lost the hero quality to it's movies. And this was perhaps Marvel's last hope. Of all their properties Guardians relied on a good story the most. But going back to Black Widow, the ability to tell an exciting and victorious Good vs. Evil story seems to have left the building. Maybe they can find their way with Marvels or Brave New World ... but I doubt it. So, 3 points for the laughs, 3 for excitement, and 1 because at least it was better than QuantumMania, and Wakanda Forever. Which unfortunately, isn't saying much.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","kqbkmp","4 May 2023","I certainly loved this movie. It was funny, it was emotional, it was dark and it was really action packed. You will be in for a suprise! This movie isn't for eveyone, since there is some animal cruelty here, but i wouldn't let that stop anyone from watching it because it's so much more to the film. You really feel the love they all for each other, and what made it believable are the performances. They were all great in their roles. I have to add that the special effects were great also, throughout the entire film. And the action is phenomenal considering it's a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie. Though, it isn't a perfect film. Not all of the jokes land, and it does feel kind of messy at the end, which is a typical thing for the Guardians movies. Regardless, I think you'll love it. Hopefully Disney can now learn from their mistakes by understanding why the third installment of The Guardians of The Galaxy was such a hit amongst the fans.","

Could have displayed his powers a little more but still good. The new Gamora was hilarious and a hundred times more dangerous! 😂
The film had a lot of scenes when it seemed that the characters where going to die. (Star Lord, Drax, Rocket) but I'm glad the survived.I think this is a brilliant film and Marvel could be getting better!","

The story, performances of the cast, especially the one of Cooper, emotional weight, actions sequences, comedic scenes, direction, screenplay, soundtrack, cinematography, production value, visual and sound effects, and ending, are all perfect and have nothing to be said against them.The movie was so good to the extent that I felt that the 150 minutes runtime was like 15 minutes, or maybe less even.Regarding the flaws, the only flaw that I found in the movie was its little, if not no, connection to the current MCU story (Kang and the multiverse). Other than that, everything else was excellent. That is why when it comes to the score, I gladly give Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 9 out of 10.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ivanmessimilos","13 July 2023","Finally, after a long time and several mediocre/bad movies, the MCU has released one great movie. A great space adventure, action full of special effects, but also a film with a soul.We got to know the Guardians through two independent films and in several associations with other heroes, characters were built with their own traits, virtues, faults, so this film leaned on those foundations and improved them a little more. Although it lasts relatively long, I didn't get that feeling because the story flows neatly alternating with the action. A great balance of emotions, a lot of humor, but also a lot of tragedy, and that is not easy to achieve. I can't believe that my eyes watered a little at some scenes in a Marvel movie, it sounds almost impossible, but then that's a real sign that the director succeeded in his plan.This movie has everything a fun sf superhero movie should have, even a little more. Probably the most emotional MCU movie, but I can't forget to mention that there is still a lot of humor and great chemistry between the Guardians. I don't want to reveal anything about the plot because I didn't know anything either, so the final impression is great.This is not a perfect movie, I won't kid myself, some characters didn't make sense to me and I wondered why they were even in the movie. But in its genre and field, this is a superb and outstanding piece of work, especially praise goes to it because it completes an excellent trilogy, definitely the best in the MCU world.","

Had the perfect amount of everything - nostalgia, emotions, and a fitting ending.I was never much of a GOTG fan to begin with; therefore, my expectations were low as I only decided to watch it for the plot. However, I ended up having a really good time. In my opinion, this was the best one amongst the three. The visual effects were good, definitely worth watching in the theatre. Not to mention the amazing soundtracks used, and boy they did make perfect use of the soundtracks to hit you right in the feels.Confused whether to go watch it or wait?

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","aciessi","23 May 2023","They teased a finale and boy, is it ever. Guardians 3 is action-packed and filled with laughs, but it wears it's broken heart on its sleeve for the majority of its runtime. In particular, your soul will be crushed with Rocket Racoon's origin story. If you have a really soft spot for fluffy animals, be warned and maybe even steer clear. A decent 30-minute chunk of the film is the Rocket story, and as something standalone, it might be one of the best things Marvel has ever made. Ultimately, it brings a new dimension to a fan-favorite character whose novelty may have already been wearing thin. The rest of the film is just the kind of dynamite entertainment only James Gunn can provide. There's nothing like seeing the guardians travel and explore in the many bizarre realms of the galaxy. Even folks with Marvel fatigue won't be able to resist this.","

Bringing back Gamora went nowhere and felt pointless. Groot is all grown up and no longer cute or funny. The High Evolutionary was so despicable I don't know why his minions didn't take him out sooner! Why was Nathan Fillion wasted on such a minor and pointless character? Action scenes are excellent but there are too many and they're so long it becomes a bit mind numbing. Vol. 3 felt at least a half hour too long and lacked the uniqueness and fun of the first two movies. Lastly the soundtrack felt forced and not as integral as the first movie.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","emilmalda","3 May 2023","This emotionally charged and entertaining rollercoaster takes you through some profoundly unpleasant scenes, yet the feelings of joy and friendship seep through the gruesome moments experienced by our favorite raccoon. But also shows you many funny and wholesome moments that add to the overall experience.Something that rarely is displayed which is heavily used in this film series is the use of music. The music in this movie does not show the average use as a enhancer for action scenes, well it does. But. It shows the importance of music as a comforting tool when we're either sad, lonely, or overwhelmed. Which is a great way to display the importance of music in our lives.This is the first time in a long time I've seen a such a good and deserving ending to a series. It really concludes the series but also set it up for future use which I'm eager to see what's up for the guardians future.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TheVictoriousV","9 May 2023","As I observed in my Ant-Man: Quantumania review, the bigger the MCU gets, the harder it gets to watch any of the trilogies by themselves, as there's so much else in this canon to account for. There's more and more that's good to know before you see the sequel to such-and-such, and there's more and more teasing being done for stuff that's set to happen in the future -- coming soon to a Chromecast near you!But now, with the final (?) entry in the Guardians of the Galaxy series, I do declare that we have one. One solid trilogy that can be viewed just fine as its own thing and may be remembered as the best, most accessible one from the MCU. There's still stuff that will seem strange if you haven't seen Infinity War and Endgame and don't know of the demise of Zoe Saldaña's Gamora, or the time-travel nonsense that brought her back, but the film is written in such a way that this doesn't feel strictly mandatory.There's even a scene where Peter ""Star-Lord"" Quill, played again by Chris Pratt, references a slew of convoluted off-screen events to explain Gamora's resurgence and eventually gives up trying to make sense of it. For those who are only here for the Guardians pictures, it's believable that such a topsy-turvy adventure would've taken place in the years since the last movie; if you do know the other Avengers films -- and are as sick of it all as I am -- you'll appreciate the meta-humor. In true James Gunn fashion, there's more to the comedy here than you may expect from the MCU. (Some elements seem to lampoon not only the MCU project -- its consequences for artists, rarely getting to keep their own stories straight -- but the very Disney empire itself)What truly sets it apart, especially from the more recent titles, is the way Gunn treats his characters. Almost everything lately -- especially the nigh-insufferable Thor: Love and Thunder -- has leaned harder into the MCU's humorous side than ever. But this is often done in the form of characters treating everything, including themselves, as a joke.Gunn makes some of the weirder movies in the MCU, yet his characters never feel like SNL parodies; they're completely genuine -- at least, nobody is as much of a joke as Tazerface in the previous film. Yes, some scenes in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 are ruined by comedy, but they're usually jokes that make sense for the characters, particularly Mantis and Drax's absolutely unsalvageable social skills, and frequently get a laugh.The actors still seem to greatly enjoy the roles, as well. Pratt, Saldaña, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Karen Gillan, and Sean Gunn reprise their roles from the previous films, and Chukwudi Iwuji plays the twisted High Evolutionary, who has a decidedly dark history with Cooper's Rocket Raccoon. (These flashbacks constitute the best scenes in the movie, giving us one of the most memorably loathsome MCU villains in many years.) We also -- somewhat pointlessly -- get Adam Warlock, whose nature in the tapestry of the comics' reality I won't even try to explain.Warlock does look fairly accurate (especially Will Poulter's eyebrows), bar the fact that his costume suffers the usual MCU-isms -- strips, pads, and anything that makes these costumes look over-designed and samey, as if all these different cultures and interstellar beings go to the same tailor -- where nothing pops or is ""too colorful"" or ""too goofy"". Still, like Vol. 2 (albeit not as much), the movie offers some of the more vibrant and interesting MCU sceneries, full of alien realms that look inviting despite the fact that everything probably wants to kill you. We even get some body horror and nasty critters (again: hilariously unsettling, yet cute and loveable), recalling Gunn's early days of B-horror nostalgia. Of course, Gunn also puts more thought into the use of licensed music than, say, the likes of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.All-in-all, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 may be exactly what the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs. The consensus seems to be that the MCU is riding on this film and that, following the less-than-desirable box office numbers of Thor 4 and Quantumania, it's all down to Gunn; if Guardians 3 fails to make bank, it may be time to accept that the MCU is finally done. As it seems, however, people are really into this movie.In between its annoyances, it hits that sweet spot -- while also being kooky -- like only Gunn knows how. Brian Tallerico correctly identified him as ""one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice"" and was even more on-point when writing that he ""loves his outcasts"". The film is certainly not perfect (weird character decisions and wasted potential are its worst non-tone-related issues), but considering everything else that's being put forth by Disney as of late, ""not perfect"" seems pretty damn incredible -- and also, considering the themes of the story, pretty apt.","

I felt so bad for him after the scene where all the caged animals get mutilated graphically. Not that the lab animals weren't demonically scary to begin with. This was even about 15 minutes after Disney let Chris Pratt drop the f-bomb in a movie kids of all ages were sure to be at and not to mention the octopus selling meth to kid animals.Shame on Disney.

a cell. The villain was whiny and annoying. Ideas for scenes are incoherent or dumb. The charm and intrigue of the original is long gone and this is a worn out exercise. Scene after scene gets stretched out excruciatingly and the humor falls flat mostly - with a lot of posing for camera going on. Then Gunn falls into the same problem his predecessor 2nd movie had with overuse of 70s/80s music and formulaic employment patterns of change scene, start new 70s music, rinse, repeat. All this for 150 mind numbing minutes. Was checking my watch over and over. Should've heeded my wife's recommendation to wait until available on streaming. 4/10.","

But through the wreckage, James Gunn has somehow retained the heart of iconic directors such as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.Finally after years of bland superhero movies and writers who care more about their personal agenda over storytelling, we have the third in the trilogy which should be known as the Star Wars of our generation.Guardians of the Galaxy got side-lined in the larger Marvel project and didn't get the praise and promotion it deserved.As a stand - alone trilogy, the James Gunn Guardians of the Galaxy is a wonder.It has loveable characters, great action, compelling story and satisfying resolution.This should have been a blockbuster of the year. Unfortunately, the poor Marvel movies that proceeded it created a general sense of Marvel underwhelming.People who may have loved to se this in the cinema were apathetic because of the terrible movies produced since Disney got hold of the MCU.Watch it. Love it. As a trilogy the Guardians of the Galaxy should become a loved phenomenon to sit along side Star Wars in our go-to Sci- fi action adventure movies.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","gavinp9","5 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3' is the fifth MCU trilogy to wrap up, but the difference here is that it feels like we've been waiting a long time, as it's almost 9 years since the original film showed us how fun and unique a ragtag bunch of semi-superhero aliens could be. Following the events of 'Avengers: Endgame' (and, to a lesser degree, 'Thor: Love & Thunder' and the Holiday Special), we pick up with Peter (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper), Groot (Diesel), Nebula (Gillan), Mantis (Klementieff), Drax (Bautista), Cosmo (Bakalova) and Kraglin (Gunn) when they're attacked by Adam Warlock (Poulter) and Rocket is injured, sending them on a journey to save him.We see a lot - maybe too much? - of Rocket's history via flashback and how he came to be. While a lot of this is emotional and builds his characters, the other characters - including the ""new"" Gamora (Saldana) - somehow seem to not have as much to do, or somehow just a little off. The ""bad guy"" they're out to defeat is The High Evolutionary (Iwuji), who has undefined powers, but needless to say, likes experimenting on animals trying to perfect evolution.There's some cameos, another good soundtrack (including a nice call-back in the mid-credits scene), top-notch CGI and some funny moments throughout. But for all the good moments, they're almost balanced with not-quite-right parts - the melancholy version of Radiohead's Creep that sets an odd tone, Rocket's whole arc, the organic space station, the High Evolutionary's mask, Gamora's character, Warlock's near pointlessness and the inevitable ending. It's not that it's bad or that they don't work, it's just a lot darker and less exuberant than the other two films.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jychoi-26438","28 June 2023","I've been really looking forward to this because Guardians of the Galaxy is by far my favorite from the MCU. Overall it was a good movie, but I couldn't help being disappointed by some aspects of it.What I enjoyed about this movie (and the two previous ones as well) is that it's such a heartwarming story that shows a beautiful friendship and teamwork among characters that would easily be considered misfits in some way or another. They don't always agree with each other, and the teamwork doesn't really seem seamless, but their heart is in the right place and they really care about each other. This is the real strength of Guardians of the Galaxy, and the third of its series did not disappoint in that manner. And of course, the cast is amazing, and the music selection is just perfect.Two things that really bothered me about Vol. 3:
1) I get that experimenting on animals can be bad, and I get that this can be an analogy of what happened among humans as well. But the way it was shown was so shallow. The movie repeatedly showed how cruel the experiment was to Rocket and his friends, and it successfully made the audience feel bad for what happened to them, but that was all. For the amount of time that the movie spent on showing the cruelty of the experiment, it didn't go into any depth of why it's really bad or why the villain thought the experiment was so necessary, so I ended up thinking ""All right, I get it, I get it. Can we move on?""
2) The villain was too weak. There was a lot of build-up about how strong High Evolutionary was, but it seemed like he was pretty easily defeated. It is a superhero movie, after all. The fight was too anti-climactic.So I don't give it the 10/10 that I was hoping for. It was still a good movie, especially compared to how disappointing the other Marvel movies have been recently.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","hdsn-18222","3 May 2023","Just come of the cinema and I am gobsmacked! This movie hits all the notes and is a genuine rollercoaster of emotions.The feeling, the aesthetics, the soundtrack, the humour all work in unison wonderfully, alongside a story which spends most of its time focussing mainly on Rocket's backstory as well as moving forward for our heroes. I simply cannot wait to watch it again.I laughed, I cried (3 times) and I was blown away. The action sequences completely land (especially the scene with the Beastie Boys - No Sleep Til Brooklyn backing track).This movie is absolute perfection. A genuinely delightful end to a superb trilogy. Bravo James Gunn and thank you the Guardians of the Galaxy 🙌🏼","

It takes the elements that made the success of the first two movies, with a twist. It's both entertaining and funny, full of new adventures and new characters.Don't get me started on the incredible cast, which includes Nathan Fillon, extraordinary, as usual.We got lucky to watch it few days before its international release here, in Saigon, but just a piece of advice : don't miss it for the world, and go watch it in theatres, preferably as we did in 4D/3DX, for the ultimate experience watching this seemingly last movie of the guardians serie.If you ask me, after the success this one will have, they will inevitably produce another...","

Groot's new look is awesome, Rocket rocked all over the movie.But I don't know what happened to the CG in marvel movies now, in this movie some scenes looks like animation movie, and can't see any perfection, but still the movie was good because of the content and direction.Guardians of Galaxy Vol 3 is such a relief after a bunch of pathetic marvel shows and movies, thanks to James Gunn.Comparing to the last two parts visuals and CG is quite a bit down, but not only in this one, after endgame it's a normal thing in every marvel movies and shows but not spiderman no way home.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","valadas","22 May 2023","Those who love sci--fi movies will surely love this one . Those who don't will appreciate it because its images, scenes and sequencies are superb. The story itself is the continuation of the two previous volumes. It takes place in a far away galaxy planet in a future very far away from the Earth's past. The main subject is the continuation of the opposition and fight of the Guardians and the High Evolutionary. The Guardians are led by the terrestrial Peter Quill. The movie develops itself in successive physical and technologic fights shown through great and powerful technologic images of course with computer help. The characters are human beings that behave like animals and animals that behave like human beings and are actually anthropomorphic. The action is strong and permanent during the movie's exhibition. One of the best sci-fi movies as a matter of fact.","

A great thank you to James Gunn for making this happen. Marvel is truly going to miss him.The storyline is beautiful, intricate but still simple and touching. Each character is so masterfully developed by its own and while there is lots going on, nothing is irrelevant or misplaced. The soundtrack is phenomenal, there is no other words to describe it. I hope we can see more of the guardians even though this is technically the any one.Easily best 3 movies ever made by Marvel.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Brother_Maynards_Brother","3 August 2023","Just finished watching this work. I was left quite satisfied. I was moved as there is genuine heart in the flick. About halfway through, I suddenly realized that I was smiling. Said physical arc remained on my visage for the remainder of the runtime. There were a number of great action sequences - lots of clever human/CGI fusions. Y'know the types of visual media that grow more appreciated by one over time? This flick will surely be one for me.I started absorbing Marvel comics (never dug D. C.) in the early 70s when I was quite young. This period of consistent Marvel repasts lasted only about eight years but my youthful love for those great comics never left me. The MCU movies through phase three were all good (well, save Iron Man 2, The Hulk and Captain Marvel) but the first Guardians movie was an outlier. Though the group was a minor entity in the comics of yore, they were re-invented as an outstanding bundle of flawed, clever, bickering, irreverent and dancing characters. The flick was just SO MUCH FUN. The team was incredibly endearing, the humor always hit, the action was top-notch and the musical selections were inspired - it was truly superb. It stood above all the other Marvel flicks in terms of quality. Now that Marvel's offerings have gone astray in terms of quality, starting with phase four, I had feared that Guardians 3 would be infected with the general suckitude virus that sadly has afflicted all other recent works (save the Spidey flick, which was fun and engaging). How relieved I am that Guardians 3 turned out to be a far outlier, in terms of quality, compared with the non-Spidey phase four and five efforts.To whoever selected the Spacehog, The The, X and The Replacements tracks, I salute you. To all involved with the creation of Guardians 3, I bow deeply before you. Very well done!Qapla'!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","eoinageary","12 July 2023","Wow !By far the best entry into the Guardians movies and up there with some of the best Marvel movies in general. The story isn't at all what I guessed from the trailers but as spoiler free as I can, a guardian gets injured and the rest of the guardians must band together to help save their life.We get the backstory of Rocket and it's heartbreaking, the high evolutionary is one of the meanest we have seen in the movies. He is cruelty with no bounds, no justification just evil.The action is great and the CG is the best it has been in a long while, the music is perfect such a perfected list that suits the movie to the ground.Stand outs are Drax, Mantis, flashback rocket and I must say Nebulas arc in her MCU journey is great !! Every cast member brought their A game and my god it pays off because it's all fantastic.F BOMB was used spectacularly 🔥 there are 2 post credit scenes, the last one if a goof nothing for the future really except a message, I forgot to mention Adam Warlock, he was really good and you can see he is so early on and I'm excited to see where his character gets to go in the MCUThe stakes are high, the heart is felt, tears swelled and overall I had a fantastic time, the perfect ending to one of Marvels best trilogy, 8.5/10.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Jithindurden","7 May 2023","They wanted to make people emotional and the way it unfolded felt a bit too desperate for it but it still works on most of the target audience. But maybe due to that, too many scenes had a disjointed feel to it. But the needle-drops, while feeling a bit forced, make the audience forget about the disjointedness. The High Evolutionary would have been more impactful if it was someone else even though the actor did fine. But when you see giant names in the cast who has nothing to do and then this guy with such a huge role comes in making no huge impact, it just feels way more important that it should've been someone else.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","timeblank","8 May 2023","The movie Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 follows a mission to save Rocket Raccoon, who has a kill switch in his heart. The team must find a passcode to prevent his death within 48 hours. Along the way, they face dangerous foes, including the High Evolutionary, who created Rocket.Dave Bautista's character in the film is exceptionally funny, and I am glad he was given the opportunity to showcase his comedic talent. However, I have some concerns about Nebula. Did she enhance her abilities? How was she able to repair herself in the heat of battle? In Endgame, she shot her future self, yet she inexplicably managed to heal herself and generate weapons. I guess lots have changed during the years.This film exceeds expectations and is one of the best in the Marvel franchise, with Jame Gunn's direction deserving particular praise.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","LeeLeeds","11 November 2023","This film was a great way to end what was a really enjoyable trilogy for the Guardians of the Galaxy.Now after having Peter's backstory earlier in the series, we shift to Rocket and while my expectations were low for whatever his 'reveal' was, they were totally exceeded by a beautiful, touching and heartbreaking tale of how Rocket came to be the angry hero we all came to know in the MCU.It's a shame this film was released somewhat out of sync with an ideal release flow after end game. We could of done with this as a kind of 'encore' to the main story of The Avengers and not had to so sit through some of the other films released in between End Game and G3.But Guardians 3 stays true to the original vibe of fun, ridiculous, touching, better than you expect cinema that started with the first film.In terms of the MCU. It's done. Every film released since End Game other than this has been awful. So if like me you have gone from MCU fan to angry to now apathetic, use Guardians 3 as the send off and final instalment of what was a brilliant series of comic book stories.","

Somehow they continue to maintain the charm of the first 2 installments and still keep the idea fresh, as well as entertaining. Not an easy chore to execute for a sequel.The cast holds their own as expected, further defining their roles as some of the strangest characters in cinema. How they manage to pull this off is still beyond me. Films like these have ruined lesser actors. You know what I mean.The film covers a lot of historical ground and goes beyond the 2 hour mark.

He was so tortured and traumatized but there is a sliver lining in that dark cage,his animal friends who share the same painful experience. My eyes are full of tears watching them go through all the misery. This storyline was so well developed and served as a backbone of the whole film. Besides, this film also focus on the personality trait of every guardian members. So marvelously written that if you're a first time viewer,you will definitely attracted to their playfulness, goofiness and dedication and amused by them. For people who are familiar with them,you find new delight in them. They had fights and bickering like all friends do,but the commitment and trust they have for each other formed such a strong bond among them. They would rescue, help each other without hesitation. The film also portraits a very despicable and psycho villian that I feel disguised looking at him,in a way a very successful character. All in all, it's the best among the guardian trilogy and there are so many emotional, amusing, delightful scenes that I would go back for rewatch,well done to cast and the production team.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","No-Life-101","7 July 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 - I finally got around to watching the movie and am so happy I did! The opening scene is excellent and shows all of the characters, the music is cool and relaxing which helps tell the story of ""this place is slow and steady"". As a warning, there are depictions of animal cruelty but things don't get too graphic, it's needed to tell the story of Rocket and his origins, and some parts were heartwarming and also heartbreaking. On another note, the thing I like most about the Guardian movies is the world-building that it has, because the story is set in space there are countless worlds that can be brought in with new characters. Also, the action scenes are engaging and fun, easy to follow along, and not overwhelming, it also fits the plot and shows that they're not just fighting for the fun of it.Additionally, the ending scene (and post-credit scene) was very heartwarming to watch. I somehow went months without seeing a spoiler for this movie and it was great because I went into the movie without knowing anything which made me love every single minute.Additional Notes:
The movie is very colourful, as is space, so it looks realisticI always forget how overpowered Mantis can be when she uses her powersNebula has changed so much since her first appearance and she is now one of my favourite charactersI was surprised to hear the swearing, normally Marvel movies don't contain swearGroot got upgrades in this movie!

And the hole history of Rocket, pretty nice. I sincerely preferred movies made for more specific audience.

Everyone got their shining moment, Star Lord, Gamora, Groot, Nebula, Drax and of course, Rocket who is the real breakout of this film.Watching Rocket's horrific past really affected not only myself but the rest of the audience that I attended this movie with. It really shows the heartbreaking past of our favorite raccoon.But this film is not all heartache, there are plenty of very funny moments as well, as well as some of the best action of any Marvel film to date. The team comes full circle by the film's end.After watching some really truly horribly AWFUL Marvel TV shows. (Here's looking at you, She-Hulk, Ms Marvel, Wandavision etc) and after some really bad recent Marvel films, Guardians 3 puts the Marvel universe back on track.Hopefully the upcoming The Marvel isn't nearly as bad as the awful Ms. Marvel Disney plus show was.Good luck to James Gunn who is leaving Marvel to head up the film division of DC films.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","rgkarim","5 May 2023","LIKES:The Plot
-A movie loaded with so much expectations has a lot to handle by Volume 3, and Guardians did not seem to be the movie to improve.-I was wrong. The plot is loaded with so much goodness it's hard to pick apart much of anything.-Strong underlying ties pick apart most characters, and help address and develop them to a classy, but fun way that had me hooked.-It wrapped itself up in comedy and other quirks, but never lost sight of the goals or focus of a character plot and it was amazing to see that happen.-And then to have a fantastic set of climaxes, to utilize old and new and handle it with such grace and yet crude fun, almost unheard of in these days.--And to keep things mixed up and constantly engaging... Gunn nailed it with the direction and writing to tie so much into a rather strong narrative that did not get lost in culture or political agendas. Wow.The Music
-Holy crap was this fun as ever. Guardians is always known for music and again they succeeded in picking a track list to fill the movie with.-The movie is of course homage to some of the most recognizable and daring songs, with variety that works to keep things dynamic and fun.-But yet, the movie again uses the music to so many levels. Comedy, a buzz vibe with action, and that perfect montage/image idea that feels like a PR shot of the characters
-Such combinations and balance, I absolutely loved its use and had a wonderful time with the selection and its use again just being that grade A pick.The Special Effects
-It's an investment in things that show how realistic you can make these make believe worlds come to life and look so polished and good.-Guardians takes this wonderful blend of real life tricks of the trade with computers and giving you the best of both worlds.'It's beautiful and adds that balance that will help age the movie well, and I feel that this just made so much come to life.-Those on animation blended things incredibly, capturing anatomy and physiology to a degree and helping add more to the shimmer of the movies
-And then comes the action moments that are gorgeous and capture to the point of getting the whole shot in the best light and not losing too much in the chaos camera as I call it.-It was so much fun, and unlike others, did not get lost too much in the over CGI that it became cheesy to separate the lines between reality and fake.The Heart
-It's been a long time since I've been moved by a movie and even longer since a Marvel movie did it for me, but GOTG 3 did it well.-I did not cry, but man did I feel it so hard in watching things unfold and the relative plots come to life with my characters.-This film hits a lot of deep topics but never to the point of losing the pace and adventure aspect, timing it to make the most opportune moments to share, and then bringing it to the full moment b putting the resolution in the story.-So much depth and the fact comedy is there to help relieve things without ever losing touch of that core character, you just don't get that quality of balance in a lot of movies.-Perhaps one of the best stories to come out of the MCU...ever.The Character Usage
-And this isn't a movie that is gauged to just one character like they often try to do.-No, GOTG for me uses the characters extraordinarily well, and balancing them all to give the means of inclusion in the movie.-Star Lord has an Arc, Gamora, Drax, and Rocket all have these deep stories that dive further into the characters than we have seen, each story not fighting for time, but rather finding the right amounts of time to share.-But then they don't bleed into one another, but mix into such a blend that you got the full effects and did not miss anything. It allowed just about everyone to play and I loved just how connected EVERY aspect was.-Even the tertiary characters had good inclusion and chemistry and it all worked so well to continue this gradual evolution of the weird family.The Acting
-Is this the Oscars? Nope, not even close. And does it touch the performances of some of the DC and Marvel crew? No, it doesn't hit those that some hold to.-What it does do well though... is bring these performances that again make the comic book crew come to life and continuing to make me invest into the characters for another go.-The conveyance of hurt, the delivery of lines, the mannerisms and the swag that comes with these characters and it really made me think of this being op acting skill in the Marvel group, or at least one of them.Iwuji is a fantastic villain that is arrogant, boastful, brash, and theatrics to make you hate him, or depending on your morals love him, and make this very binding villain.-Pratt does his job well and gives Quill some bite, charm, and a wonderful balance that is fun and still his character, but not overwhelming.-But Cooper... man does Cooper give one of the best hits for me. Touching, but fun,, deep and yet not overdramatic, and I just loved how well he brought everything to the mix. What a performance.-It works everything together and gives you such dynamic chemistry that I don't have enough room to keep it going.The Comedy
-It's Guardians, it has to be funny. Again, the mission is accomplished and in a manner that was very balanced for me.-I said it earlier, but when you put comedy in tune with the story, pacing, and mood, you find me very impressed with it being added as a device.-Then you bring in the timing that is so well, and you find these ridiculous surprises hitting you at the right moments.-Add the nearly R rated moments that come into play, and Gunn's attitude with a leash really accomplished a lot in use, necessity, and fun.-It was all done quite amazing to the point it was nearly perfect for me, and kept me laughing the whole time at the dynamic spread that we got.The Pace
-Was incredible, an entertaining bout of everything at a pace that was balanced and respectful to the story and adventure.-Fast to keep things moving and getting to the end, yet slow enough to stay on the story and give the buildup and emotion the full effect it needs.-I loved the depth of it all and not once did I feel bored or the movie too bloated as I was timing the pace of the movie.The Surprises
-The movie has lots of predictable things, but the movie throws in some intergalactic tricks to really keep you on your toes.-Changes in the plot are some of the biggest lines crossed and surprised, whilst the levels Gunn goes to convey the danger of this man are quite a shocker.-You'll find that the movie really has some things to mix up the formula and make a Marvel movie feel fun and exciting again.DISLIKES:Sometimes A Tad Too much Comedy
-It's rare, but this is a comedy central series so you can expect Gunn to cross the lines a few times.-The idiotic moments are some of the stale moments, while other times it's a running joke that has run too far for my liking.-Caution to those with younger people who don't want cursing, heavy insults, and some demoralizing moments as they are present in this film.Some More Graphic Stuff
-This movie also is a bit more mature than you might expect and not in the indirect way that they used to do.-The third installment of the movie does overstep some things and hit a more mature feel that you might not expect. It's violence alone will cause some to turn away, while the graphic nature and design feel like only a censor shy of belonging to HBOMax.-And some moments with the animal cruelty and darker moments were a bit harder to watch and excessive, but the story component helps blunt that a bit.A Little More Action Early On
-The movie actually works well to build up action and give it some gusto, but I won't lie that I found it again geared towards comedy and not the action fest the trailers promised.-A little more of the end game's battle, (which was amazing) in a few earlier battles would have perfected this and given me just the right balance in this category.-Fortunately, there is so much other things that even this is a smaller dislike, though again there are still moments I would have done to help maximize the potential.The VERDICT:
Guardians of the Galaxy was Gunn's love letter to the series and he did it super well for me in showing that comic book movies still have some potential. It took so much pressure and made a diamond, a star amidst most of the modern that was an adventure I was hoping for. It's fun, funny, exciting and just full of the comic book feel I come to the movies for and escaping the madness of the modern day. But that doesn't mean it has lost the real factor that comes with the MCU and that makes for a deeper film that respected the characters built, the stories made, and further dives into them to make such a spectacle. I loved so much of the balance in it and the way they got the Galaxy running again. Sure, it is going to be debatable on the violence, graphicness, and darker tones and there is some fine tuning that could be done. But in the current state of Marvel, it shined for me and is worth a trip to the theater definitely. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cahidi","29 July 2023","I think it's safe to say that this is the best Guardians Of The Galaxy movie so far. It revealed Rocket's dark past and told us about the future for the rest of the Guardians. But one thing that really touched me is the smile on Nebula's face. I thought I'd never see the day, yet here it is. She even laughed! That's so touching, she finally becoming a true family member of the Guardians. And even though Gamora isn't the same as before, she's still there. Even if she's not with the Guardians anymore. Another thing that I like about this third volume, is that Kraglin finally mastered Yondu's arrow. I'm looking forward to the next volume of the Guardians Of The Galaxy.","

An interesting villain that showed intelligence as well as notable power didn't overshine new lovable characters and the core group. Character development was instrumental to making this movie great with the depth of each scene making every line hit close to home. Each character was given their own time to shine and shine they did. A couple forced lines and some interesting CGI choices are all that keep this from being in the conversation of best Marvel movie to date.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dex_90","13 August 2023","Similar to other late Marvel movies, full of tired jokes that are played out by now.Script writing and plot that seems to lack any coherence or consistency.They start off by wanting to ""save Rocket"", in the process they invade several high-security facilities, put thousands of lives at risk including their friends and their own, watch as a planet with presumably billions of sentient creatures gets blown up without trying to do anything to save it (or them). Then once again put an entire settlement with thousands of people's lives at risk and have it invaded (Knowhere) to save a few of their friends lives that decided to board the big bad's ship in a ""funny"" scene and then decide that they have to save a few hundred children or animals because as opposed to the creatures on the planet these ones really matter.In the process they sometimes decide to horribly injure or murder random people like guards or a scientist while sparing the life of the big bad that just blew up a planet, because... reasons. Maybe his ugly face triggered a bout of sympathy or they are suddenly ""the Guardians"" or something.It all doesn't really make any sense anymore. Spaceships go Woosh, Guns go Bang or Pew, Planet and Space Station go Boom.""Did that look cool?"" No, no it didn't.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jssfranch","4 May 2023","This movie is genious when it comes to the psychology of the characters. They all have very extreme and crystal clear personalities. Each and every character of the movie comes through in equal terms and the focus is on the group and their relationships. Disfunctional and lovable relationships just like in real life.A special mention to the impossible/amazing duo Mantis-Drax. She is an empath raised in total isolation, which is a contradiction per se, and he is a total sociopath that means no harm. Together they become a total clash of extremes that gives your ears and eyeballs one of the best cinematic experiences of pure heart-moving friendship. Just genius. Kudos also to Nebula and her character development, from villain to hero, with a huge-huge heart.All and all, a beautiful, moving, heart-warming film.I'd like to thank the entire team for this amazing experience.","

The hardest thing is knowing there aren't any plans for Volume 4 & 5 and you have the Fast Saga with 10 movies. It's absolutely criminal when you think of that.This volume, was perfectly written and brought to life. What helped is knowing there was a clear vision and a group of filmmakers motivated and inspired by that vision, all working together to make it happen.I would imagine there's so much more still to explore; Peter and Gamora's love story, adventures of Drax and Mantis, rebuild of Knowhere, so many untapped villains and so many civilizations yet to be explored.Totally gutted by his movie, towards the end you could easily have tears full, not ready to say goodbye :(","

It exceeded my expectations completely! There was a nice blend of humour, sentiment, tragedy, love and I felt like every character got their time to shine. There were no cheap plot points and the action was well paced. Didn't feel any boredom unlike other recent marvel movies.It was a little darker, especially with some mild gore, but it added to the weight and themes of the movie. The voice acting by Bradley Cooper was amazing. It was a bittersweet ending to the trilogy but somehow I feel a little excited for what's to come!","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","vrpqqzxp","31 July 2023","To be honest when I first watched the movie in the theatre I wasn't sure if it would be good. Like there is this thing that as more films are released for the trilogy it get worse and more bad, but in the guardians of the galaxy trilogy it's just ain't like that, every movie of the trilogy is good. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to the third movie but then my friend forced me to come with him, and it was SO MUCH FUN I wa in shock when Sylvester Stallone came out of nowhere. But the movie was so funny and say and the action was also good and I had so much fun. I cried a lot during the movie but that's what make movie a good movie doesn't it? In my opinion of course, most of the movies I liked the most are the movies that I cried the most. In my opinion, when the movies gets me into a emotional mood they're good, 'cause I think action and fights it is not all about the movie, there need to be emotions in the movie who will make the people who watching the movie feel something. I think if the movie is just action and fight it is a little big boring, and I'm fan of action movies but there is need to be things that. Will evoke emotions in the crowd who watching the movie. In my opinion emotional scene in movies it is very important. And in conclusion, for those who haven't seen the movie, you absolutely should.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TharsheyN","10 July 2023","A solid ending to the Guardians Of The Galaxy trilogy. This film focuses mainly on Rocket and his past, with a sprinkling of Gamora x Peter and more weirdly some Peter x Nebula it would seem.The storyline is pretty good; Peter starts of depressed, nothing like the old leader he once was until Rocket is injured and that spurs him into taking charge once again. The rest is the adventure they take part in to heal him back up.The casting was well the old cast who are all perfect in their roles plus a new villain who definitely did a good job playing his character. Equal parts, mad, good, scientist and psychopath.The VFX and SFX were pretty good, the CGI especially was better then the past few Marvel movies and that is something to be thankful for for sure.Anyway overall really enjoyed the movie compared to previous marvel offerings. A solid 7/10 for me, good acting, storyline and ending plus a much better CGI then expected from Marvel nowadays.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cmarlborough","8 May 2023","By far the best Marvel film since Endgame, and so anticipated in our house that we were all really excited by the time the trailers finished. I was worried that it wouldn't live up to the weight of expectation but James Gunn is a master and, thank goodness, was given free rein to make something truly special. The music was great, dipping into the 2000s perfectly. The story focuses on Rocket this time and is heartbreaking in places. There is more gore and swearing in this film that any we have seen so far which might be problematic for more sensitive kids, but my kids (8&11) loved it.The film is long but doesn't feel it at all, the pace is consistent and the timing is brilliant, with a mix of classic Guardians humour and serious, character developing plot lines.In particular there are a few stand-out moments. Peters conversations with Gamora are really heartfelt, all the young Rocket scenes are sad and borderline traumatic, Drax character arc is fabulous, there are a couple of near-death scenes that brought us all to tears and I love that Peter's family finally find out that he is alive and well at the end (I hate loose ends!)
There are two end credit scenes in which the prospect of both another guardians film and a future Starlord appearance are set up so worth a watch.Overall I loved it.To watch this and understand every reference you need to watch the first two films, plus Infinity Wars, Endgame and the holiday special.","

It is darkly twisted, gritty, hilarious, touching. Everyone leaves their caricature shells behind, they grow and they deal. It is the most adult, down to earth instalment in the Guardians trilogy but at the same time the most insane, over-the-top soup of craziness. When the end credits roll, the nostalgia levels are through the roof, tears are rolling down the cheeks.We couldn't wish for a better goodbye. It might look like a new hope for the struggling post-Endgame MCU but I'm afraid it is just the last echo of the good old past.","

Only one surprise in the story for me as I know the RR story from way back so I was more focused on the other bitsIts not perfect way to much this is the last time we will see each other but they have space ships so em maybe not G and Neb managed fine. The absence of G was frankly week and the hole I am not your G was week before the end of Avengers and the split was what a long week ends difference that must have been a hell of a (Hangover) weekend murderess wack job too Super Hero in 3 - 4 days or one kiss come onEvery one gets to say good by audience actors and characters despite again it being pointless that every one has a space ship and Neb and G managed it its like those scenes in USA TV Shows were we get a scene for no other reason than its the last season episode and its nice but whyHere we get the added bonus of watching the heroes at their super best working hand in glove perfection to kill a lot of (innocent) slave soldiers after the big bad guy had blown up a planet and the heroes had well em ah done er (nothing) oh well they got a bit confused (I told you not to think about it)Look you don't go to GotG film to examine the motivation involved by the evil charterer do we we go to see big bangs and space ships to see super hot characters being cool if the writers are OK we get a FF family dynamic and if your lucky you get Bumblebee humour this had all of them and to be frank it sits with the Suicide Squad and Vol. 1 and 2 a very good example of a Si-Fi fantasy Comic Book Movie and thank Goodness only one alternant character see it can do doneI have been a fan of GotG for nearly 30 years and have been reading RR since he was the second story in Transformers UK comics and I have to say this is not my outcome for my favourite Marvel characters but it is an (barely) adequate one despite the unnecessary (MCU) deaths along the way and I was at the end (ignoring the child soilder) content and entertained is the MCU back I hope so but I am not sure one swallow dose not a summer make.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","spaulagain","20 August 2023","The first Guardians film is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has such an incredible ensemble of comedy, music, campiness and heart that resulted in what to me is a perfect film. Easily in my top 10 along side Empire Strikes Back and Shawshank.Volume 2 was great as well, but began to show the limits of Gunn's follow through. It overplayed the comedy, and didn't feel like an adventure.Volume 3 is unfortunately even more subpar for the trilogy. From the beginning scenes, it felt rushed and contrived. From there on the whole film circled around Rocket's backstory which after the whole Ego thing, seemed quite repetitive. The story really only became a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" in the last 20mins or so, and that was really just a convenient circumstance.Sure Rocket's backstory pulled some heartstrings, but it also left the rest of the film scrambling to make sense of it all and create a plot with it. The humor was attempted, the plot was contrived, and the characters all felt like they were just their for a ride rather than driving the story with their decisions.Vol. 3 is a disappointing end to the trilogy. Certainly better than any recent MCU film, but by far the weakest in the trilogy. Oh well.","

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","rannynm","5 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the perfect end to this Marvel trilogy. It's an emotional journey, and, for me, a bit of a tearjerker - bring some tissues. I connected strongly with the characters and throughout the movie deeply cared about them. I also love this movie because of the strong messages, astonishing CGI and the ""marvelous"" acting.This movie switches between Rocket's (Bradley Cooper) backstory and the mission to save Rocket embarked on by Star Lord/Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Groot (Vin Diesel), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Drax (Dace Bautista), and Mantis' (Pom Klementieff). The new Gamora (Zoe Saldaña) also joins them, but she isn't the same Gamora we knew. Can the Guardians save Rocket and the galaxy in time? Watch to find out! As always, make sure to stay until the end of the credits!Guardians of the Galaxy is one of my favorite franchises within the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), and director James Gunn and the actors are the biggest reasons why. Gunn has made these movies unique and distinct from the other Marvel movies. Although it's still funny, this movie resonates emotionally with the audience more than the first two Guardians. You can feel the pain and traumatic experiences of the characters. Star Lord as Chris Pratt is perfect. I've never seen a role as good as this one for Pratt, and for me he will always be Peter Quill. Even though Rocket is completely CGI, Bradley Cooper's voice performance makes me believe he is real. My favorite character is Drax (David Bautista) because he is very sweet and funny, and whenever he's on screen, I enjoy it immensely.The message of this movie is that friendship and teamwork are the most powerful forces in the galaxy. This movie contains some profanity, violence, and some gross scenes.I give Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 4 out of 5 stars, and I recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Marvel and Guardians of the Galaxy fans will definitely enjoy this movie. It comes out in theaters on May 5, 2023. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!","

But it won't stop me from having a great time thanks to an engaging story, great characters that give their backstory that fit for the movie, great humor, top notch action that keeps the movie exciting, and amazing visuals that make the galaxy look like anyone would like to explore. For those that loved the previous two, or especially those that want to see this for after the events of Infinity War, I highly recommend this one.

But do some research, it took me two seconds to find out what's in this movie.We literally have information at our finger tips.I also saw a bad soundtrack review. The music is great once again.This is not a perfect movie and it suffers from mcu-ness.However the good parts shine so well.All the characters are given ample screen time and move the narrative forward. I feel Drax was the most underused, but he had some heartfelt moments too.This movie is a reminder that the directors love for a project can really shine through.I couldn't help but think I'm excited to see what Gunn does with the DCEU (or dcu, or whatever they are calling it)Legend for mcu-ness:
Some of the gci was not great
Cheesy out of place jokes
Ruined scenes for jokes
Cookie cutter bad guys (although this one was almost really good - the whole concept around him was good)Overall this is a good movie.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","leocoolio","4 May 2023","All Guardians of the Galaxy movies stand out among Marvel as especially relevant in themes and adept in conveying real emotional moments. This is largely thanks to the great writing and direction by James Gunn who delivers a great finale to the trilogy that will make you feel both sadness and joy but also again delivers strongly on the themes of family, friendship, dealing with grief, moving on from it and the value of kindness, which is already a great feat given the somewhat absurd setting of an action space opera.There are many very very well written character moments especially for Rocket but for the other characters as well that and several moments that will make you choke up and even cry for either the tragedy or beauty of the moment if you allow yourself to dive into them.The humor is again very well timed and unlike other Marvel movies does not take away from the more serious moments or overstay its welcome like in the recent Thor installment.I love the direction they took for the characters as well and it gives Chris Pratt a couple of moments to shine as an actors who can be more than just funny (which he still is very much).Although in terms of humor no one holds a candle to the absolute perfect timing and intonation of Dave Bautista who I very much admire both for his performance but also his integrity around the Gunn firing and re-installment.In closing if you enjoyed Guardians 1 and 2 this is the perfect closure for the trilogy that will make you laugh, cry and think a lot not just about animal testing but also (if you are dealing with that) might help you deal with emotions of grief and moving forward.",NA

Acting was great, lot of tumultuous emotions but for those that are sensitive you may find this hard to sit through. Mainly the Rocket backstop scenes of animal experiments. I'm sure my opinion is a small minority here but just beware if hurting animal scenes bother you. Other than that, typical action and humor though less (humor) than the other Guardian movies. Ties together a lot of the previous Guardian story lines though. Oh and FYI there are TWO after ending scenes so make sure to stay for both.",NA
