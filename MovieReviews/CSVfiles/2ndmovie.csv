"Avengers: Infinity War","RJBrez","24 January 2021","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end. Enjoy!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","0U","23 February 2020","This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Alex_Lo","5 February 2021","A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","grztxks","14 March 2021","Infinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","uzair-36867","8 February 2021","This film is an achievement unto itself. Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","andreascaloni","16 February 2021","Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.Rating: 9.6.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Abdulxoxo","5 February 2021","Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.
Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Puroo","21 April 2021","It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Filmdokter","25 October 2021","#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Jesper2801","26 April 2018","I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","shawneofthedead","25 April 2018","Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Platypuschow","4 May 2018","Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film","

"Avengers: Infinity War","cartermain","20 January 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours.

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheLittleSongbird","2 May 2018","Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"Avengers: Infinity War","garethvk","24 April 2018","Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.

"Avengers: Infinity War","jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","12 June 2018","Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","eva3si0n","8 January 2021","The first Marvel film I really liked. Surprisingly in the film there are many spectacular scenes, which are well held and the main transition between them is made seamless, which does not make you miss. And the main thing that surprises the film - the ending, it really makes it clear that Marvel now plays big, since began to break up with the main heroes of the giving films.","

After re-watching Infinity War multiple times it still gets me because it's sad the ending really is just another cinematic masterpiece which Marvel always pull off and the fight scenes are amazing. Marvel have some of the best actors and the best casts I'm not applaud them for that. No mad Steve was just sexy after mate and I loved it a lot.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","ACollegeStudent","17 December 2021","Rating: 9.0This went where no other mainstream superhero movie went and killed everyone, allowing Thanos to win. The biggest flaw I can think of with this is that there are other ways to achieve Thanos's goal without killing everyone, and there were some plot grievances like Corvus Glaive somehow sneaking all the way to Shuri in the battle unnoticed, and them not just digging under Wakanda's shield to begin with (they did later in the battle). Also, destroying an infinity stone should cause the universe to collapse in some way as explained in Endgame about taking stones from universes, so I'm not sure why none of the main cast raised this issue when destroying the mind stone was ratified into their gameplan (they might have not known better, though). Otherwise, great pacing, a great soundtrack, crisp visuals, seamless comedy, a compelling and humanized villain, and a haunting ending.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Dello_","6 September 2021","Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","pjgs200","12 May 2018","I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Horst_In_Translation","4 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once.I think that movies, especially superhero films, often stand and fall with their villain and here we have Thanos played by Josh Brolin as the main antagonist and he is just utterly great and memorable. Maybe you could say that his (self-perceived godly) ambition to erase half the planet is a bit too mathematical, but everything else about him is outstanding and I have virtually no doubt that he will end up as one of the most memorable villains of the movie year 2018. Even in his weaker story lines, like the part with his ""daughter"" that does not feel entirely convincing early on, he shines and elevates the material to a level where it really saves this entire part of the movie. So yes huge thumbs-up for Thanos. And another thumbs-up for virtually everybody else. Except Starlord unfortunately because honestly his grief may have been huge, but the how he basically destroyed the Avengers' effort that had them close to victory was just ridiculous, so to some extent you can blame him for billions of people dying eventually. Or are they really? I believe there will be a new Avengers movie in 2019 by the same team of writers and directors, so the ending may not be as finite as it seemed to be. You can almost call it a duology. Is all hope really lost? We have to wait a year and see. Honestly I doubt it because there will be a Black Panther 2 for sure at some point, so I guess they will find a way to get things right again for the good guys. It will also be interesting to see if they bring back those who died earlier too, not just those that vanished at the very end.Anyway, this film we have here is one that will make a huge impact come awards season 2018/2019 in all technical categories, especially Visual Effects where it is maybe a lock for an Oscar nomination with a great chance to take home the win. Another thing I would like to say about this film is that it is also a triumph in terms of the comedy, which is not always a success in Marvel works. But here there are some really hilarious scenes and as many bad things as I said about Chris Pratt's character earlier, his banter with Thor is hilarious. And there is a lot more of course. Drax is also amazing in that one scene where he stands there doing nothing. You will recognize many other pretty funny moments when you see them. So what is it that made this film so amazing. I would say it is the script this time. It is bold, daring and not scared of anything while never becoming too absurd or unrealistic (and yes that is possible for superhero films *cough* Deadpool *cough* glad we did not see him in here). But the outcome here is the exact opposite of too many cooks spoiling the broth, both character- and writer-wise. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this one and good thing is you really don't need to have seen any other Avengers or Marvel movie to appreciate the quality we were given with this one. I am truly very curious about the sequel and cannot wait to check it out. This third Avengers movie is my favorite 2018 release at the point of April. And it has a huge chance to stay in the top5, probably top3 until the end of the year. It never dragged, which is always a success for this running time and it gets better by the minute the longer it goes. And the way things turn out eventually reminded me a bit of the last Wolverine film ""Logan"". Happy endings are no longer essential. Realism is what it is all about. Highly highly recommended.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","MrDHWong","25 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10","

"Avengers: Infinity War","numenorsniper-66396","25 November 2021","I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","r96sk","23 January 2021","This is exactly the sorta thing I want from an Avengers film! Full blown, no punches pulled action. In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!Despite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.Like 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.Speaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.There are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.Needless to say, I can't wait to see 'Avengers: Endgame'!","

They weren't speaking English as I had no idea what they were talking about half the time or should I say most of the time! Maybe if they cut the cra[ & made the film snappy it probably would've made more sense & instead of dragging the climax out in such a choppy changing like manner (what climax, I'll get to that later) anyway, as well as repetitive, the climaxes ending was all over the place! Bad guys gets ""killed"", comes back again, gets killed, comes back, more chopping & changing, then a slow dragged out scene, then back to the climax! The end outstayed its welcome, & well as soon as it got to the 2hr mark, you knew they need to wrap it up, but it took another 40mins to do that! Damn!And the ending... don't make me laugh!!

"Avengers: Infinity War","lisafordeay","6 May 2018","OK I loved the sequel Age Of Ultron as it focused more on the Avengers themselves but I will get into the negatives later.Avengers Infinity War is the prequel to the 2015 film and tells the story of the Avengers who are no longer working together and must try and defeat a giant half monster/ human called Thanos (Josh Brolin)who wants the stones known as the infinity stones. Each one makes Thano more powerful and it's up to the team to somewhat get back together and join the guardians of the galaxy(Chris Pratt, Zoe Salvada,Bradley Cooper). Will they stop Thano?The special effects are very good along with the cinematography. However the film itself is 50/50 for me. The downside of this film was that there was too much going on and I was so dissapointed with the hulk played by Mark Ruffalo as you never see him as the hulk at all this time. Jermery Renner who played Hawkeye was absent in this and the film was so hard to follow e.g what happened to Thor's eye. I felt like it was skipping or whatever.Overall do yourselves a favour and watch the 2015 version instead or try and watch all the Marvel films to get used to the story.Also has Tom Holland,Robert Downey Jr,Gwyneth Paltrow,Don Cheadle,Chadwick Boseman,Karen Gillian and even a cameo by Stan Lee.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","blparker-31738","27 April 2018","All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie.","

Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.","

I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters.Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of ""wait, where are we?"" or ""wait, why are they fighting again?"". This one felt more compact to me.

As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.","

So they say. Then there is this new mega movie Avengers Infinity War, now i would take issue with anyone that this is actually a movie at all, it is a consumer product the must see/ have accessory for the moment, Pre-sold, Pre-packaged to a ready made audience desperate to spend their money, it is just another fashionable element in today's throw away age.

Can i be positive in any way about this Marvel, well i saw it in 4DX & 3D, the chair swam and jolted, there were lights, flashes, and sprays or did i imagine the last one, oh yes, the sound was loud, very very loud. and Oh yes do not forget, it is extremely long, very very long, like a bad flight across the Atlantic but without the benefits of a helpful service attendant's tray.

"Avengers: Infinity War","brianjohnson-20043","8 May 2018","I like the stand alone Marvel Movies more, but it almost feels like an obligation to see all of them if you want to see the ones you like, or else, you'll have no idea what's going on when the ones you like continue. I'm prefacing with that so readers understand that I'm not just a hater.First off, I want to address the villain. My opinions I've heard/read asserted Thanos is a strength to this film. I found that to be the opposite. I found his motivation more convincing than the Justice League villains, who were so bad, I can't even really remember their motivation, and a bit less stupid than Ultron who was the AI thing that might have seemed like a real issue in the 80s or early 90s. But today it seems clear that the misuse of technology to our demise is going to be gradual rather than sudden. The vulture from Spider Man Homecoming, or the villain from Black Panther were much more compelling In my Opinion. Thanos felt like a cartoonish version of the villain Samuel Jackson played in the first Kingsmen movie. Except that Thanos didn't work like how the similar villain in Kingsmen worked. They're both trying to save everything by killing off a sizable chunk of people before people kill their planet or planets. The difference is that Thanos wants to randomly and painlessly kill half of everyone everywhere, and Valentine wants to save a few chosen wealthy friends. Overpopulation and idiocy is a real issue on earth. But in the Marvel Universe, it's a planet to planet issue, and it seems stupid to just kill off half of everyone on some planets which might not have any actual problems. And this issue is never even questioned by any of the characters. They just try to play the card that Thanos should try to save people, not kill them. Not a bad point. But it didn't seem like any of the Avengers seemed even remotely interesting in addressing Thanos' concerns. Not even Gamora. Plus, if someone gets two or three of these infinity stones, let alone all of them, can't they use that person yield that power to do good rather than evil? It just didn't settle very well with me. Loki was a much better villain because he's like the Joker. Destruction and chaos is his high. That's a real thing in people that an audience should be able to understand.The strength of this movie is the humor. I laughed repeatedly and was certainly entertained in that regard. It also, no surprise, looked really good and had great music. I was surprised how well the Guardians characters fit in with the other Marvel characters. But to me a feature length movie, even a short one, can't be good if the story isn't compelling. And this movie is long. If the villain's story was halfway decent it would have stood a good shot, but just getting characters together that one likes and making a spectacle, won't make up for giant flaws in the story. I didn't expect everything to be concluded, because these movie all set up more to come. But with an ending like this film has, it should have been advertised as the 1st part of 2 movies from the start. I really don't get how the next Ant-Man movie is going to work after what happened here in Inifinity Wars. Unless it takes place prior to the events of Infinity Wars, I don't see it working. But if that's the case, why not have Ant Man 2 come out first? I'm not a comic book reader. I open them up, look at the picture and think:""I'm supposed to take these silly-looking overdramatic characters and pictures seriously? Do other people see how goofy these images are? What am I, 10? But I've heard from friends who like the comics that much of the events of this film unfolded as they did to stay loyal to the events in the comics. My response to this is that every form of entertainment's first goal should be to work within its own form. To me Infinity Wars' narrative doesn't work for a feature movie. I was upset with how it ended. And I know I wasn't the only one in the theater upset. And I find it disgraceful that, at the moment, this movie has 8.9 stars out of 10. Black Panther doesn't have 8 and it's actually good. What's wrong with people? This movie is currently ranked ahead of movies like 12 Angry Men, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, It's a Wonder life, American History X, The Prestige or Every Single Pixar Movie. What is wrong with people?","

"Avengers: Infinity War","hawkins_saints_rock","25 April 2018","Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable. The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them. My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it. Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves. 9.8/10","

"Avengers: Infinity War","eden-rabatsch","25 April 2018","Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","nodlimax","28 April 2018","This movie has various problems and the first major one is the lack of focus. We keep jumping around to various places and I can't even keep where all of them were.One moment, we are on earth, the next on Knowhere, the next on some other planet to which I can't even remember the name. And it's not just the places, it's the characters too. There isn't one lead or even 5 lead characters we can somewhat focus on. They try to focus on everybody which means nobody is the actual lead character. There was another movie that was initially praised but in the end was heavily critizised for lacking focus on a real main character - that was Star Wars The Phantom Menace. I see the same problem in this regard here with the story.Due to the lack of focus the movie also has pacing issues and therefore to me felt boring. And then this goes on for 150 minutes. And the biggest problem at the end of the movie is that there is no payoff.......ok stop, I have to correct myself there. The payoff (here comes the spoiler) is, that the bad guy wins. Everything the heroes tried to do failed and you know what I was actually kinda rooting for Thanos, because I couldn't care enough about any of the other characters. He became the protagonist for me, which makes me feel terrible as well, because he kills half the population in the universe.In the end I was just happy that the movie was over. However the writers put themselfes in a corner. Thanos is pretty much god at this point and objectively speaking there is no way anyone could defeat him at this point except if they go for something like ""his glove lost the power after he used it"" which is cheap. That will then result in the heroes trying to get back the time stone and then turning back time or something similar stupid.I will not see the next one in cinema. At this point I am pretty much done with superhero movies. I guess I can thank Disney now for first pushing me away from Star Wars and now Marvel.The effects and sound were decent though.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","deastman_uk","28 April 2018","How long has it been since the Dark Knight? The DC film that defined how an epic comic book fantasy could wrap a world around a hero and a villain.Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.","

Judging by the way it has been positively reviewed by some other IMDB members, I cannot help but wonder if we watched the same movie. I fell asleep repeatedly during the opening night screening in my city and I lost most interest in it after 90 minutes or so. (The run time was much too long.) While I've enjoyed quite a few of these Marvel big-screen productions in recent years, I didn't enjoy this one very much at all. Unless you're a comic book fan, I'd take a pass on this one.","

This is not even the best Marvel movie this year(Black Panther had better story & drama), definitely nowhere near 'best superhero movie ever'. The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence. For the record, I loved Avengers, loved Winter Soldier so it is not like I cannot enjoy a superhero flick. This one is not(unless you are a fanboy(girl).","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Lursa","6 May 2018","SPOILER ALERT!!
I am a Marvel Chick. I totally dig the whole Marvel Verse and wave my 'fangirl flag' proudly. I was looking forward to this movie so much...then something happened. I went to see it today. I did not read any of the reviews before I went. I never do. I always view a film without input from folk that usually don't know what I like. So there I was, popcorn and coke in hand. Two rows back from the screen ('cause I'm into total immersion, okay) in my reclining seat. Ten minutes in and I know we're in trouble. It's not the fact that two of my favorite characters didn't survive the opening credits. This is Infinity War, right? People are gonna die. It's just seemed so pointless. Loki dies but Thor survives? How is that fair? Hemdall dies saving Hulk of all people?? Not that I'm hatin' on Hulk...but come on, Hemdall! You have sworn an oath to the 'Thone of Asgard' and you don't save EITHER of the princes? Really?? I know Hulk is refusing to 'come out' after Thanos kicks his butt that no one ever has before but still...The movie goes rapidly downhill from here. Thanos and his twisted cult of psychopaths got on my nerves early and they danced all over them until the end of the film. We bounce all over the world (and off it) to keep Thanos away from the Infinity stones. Who decided that two of the most important stones be 'hidden' on earth? Not a good idea. Our Merry Band of Marvel Heroes needs to take a page out of the Star Trek verse. 'The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few or the one.' This could have saved SO many lives. Loki gives Thanos the Tesseract to save Thor. Thanos tried to kill them all anyway. Actually succeeds in killing both Loki, Hemdall and all of the Asgardians. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, the daughter he loves. (Thanos has a really weird idea of what love entails...but whatever) He does this so he can gain access to the Soul Stone. Dr. Strange gives Thanos the Time Stone to save Tony Stark. (Tony Stark? Wasn't his expiration date up like a couple years ago?? ) This gives Thanos the power to turn back time whenever he wants. Which he does after Scarlett Witch kills Vision (her lover) to destroy the Mind Stone. He just turns back time. Rips the stone out of Vision's head and heads off to wipe out life as we know it. So Scarlett Witch went through all that gut wrenching heartache for nothing.This could have been a good movie. Maybe even a great one but it's not. It's a mishmash of the worst parts of just about every Marvel movie over the past 10 years. There are a few notable omissions. Most of the gang is on deck but they're so ineffective. They rehash the same differences they had in their other movies showing little or no growth or development aside from the superficial 'romantic' themes. I get that Pepper and Tony are an item. We knew this already. I get that Black Widow and Bruce are an item. We knew this two movies ago. Same with Gamora and Peter, Scarlett Witch and Vision. and on and on and on. This is supposed to make their loss more poignant but it doesn't. The fight sequence in Wakanda and on Thanos home planet were so predictable. Such a waste of excellent CGI and actors.The only surprise in the movie is who survives. Thor, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers survive. I know this is to set up the next part of the Infinity War set that is scheduled to hit theaters later this year. The Russo boys need to step up their game. This disappointment does not bode well for the new film. Guys. sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Just FYI. You just know that someone is going to get hold of the time stone and turn back time so we can blah, blah, blah. Been there, done that. I really wanted to love this movie. I really, really did. But I left the theater feeling used and not in a good way. I felt like Marvel turned up the manipulation meter to eleven. Because, you know it's eleven which is one more than ten, right?I rated the movie a '4' because I wanted it to be good. It just wasn't.","

Well, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars.
Note that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc...

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheSeaLion","1 May 2018","While all of the heroes from across the Marvel cinematic universe united in a joint effort to stop Thanos, so too did all of the problems you can think of unite in a joint effort to bring down ""Infinity War.""It should be noted that I am not the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the most part, I find the movies to be passable while there are a few I have really liked, such as ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and some I have despised, such as ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers."" ""Infinity War"" could have fallen anywhere on the spectrum for me, and unfortunately, it fell at the way-down low side as the second worst movie in the entire franchise.The opening scene of the movie is the perfect setup for what is wrong with ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attacking an Asgardian ship with all of the main characters from ""Thor: Ragnarok"" on it. Thanos has killed everyone aboard, except for the few characters necessary to help keep the plot moving. Heimdall (Idris Elba) is left wounded so that he can be killed off by Thanos on screen after using his powers to send Hulk (Bruce Banner) to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers. It is supposed to be an emotional death scene, but the laziness of the writing and the showcasing of character stupidity for the purpose of plot progression is all too evident. Why didn't Thanos just kill Heimdall during the attack on the ship like he did with everyone else on board? It's simple: the plot would not be able to continue if he had done that.Character stupidity is at an all time high in ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" and it is not just restricted to Thanos. There is a lack of communication between characters for no reason other than for the movie to happen, and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) goes so far as to screw everything up in what is easily the worst written scene in the entire movie.The stupidity of the characters can all be attributed to an awfully written script. So much of the dialogue in the movie is the Marvel quips, but a lot of it comes in the form of characters throwing personal jabs at one another to the point of wondering why these heroes can't set aside their differences and not be annoying for even five minutes in order to stop a villain who wants to wipe out half of the universe's population.Yep, that's right. Thanos' goal is to wipe out half of the population of the entire universe. One complaint that people have had with Marvel is how safe their characters all feel. So, Thanos killing off half the population would seem like it was putting their characters in danger, right? Wrong. All of the characters who are killed by Thanos are the characters who had already overstayed their welcome in the franchise or do not feel permanent because, let's be honest, they are needed for future installments to the Marvel universe. It is ironic that the movie that seemingly takes the most risks is the movie that played things the safest.Even if these deaths did feel like a risk, it would not really matter. With so many characters to focus on, the movie has almost no time for character arcs (which is fine) and instead must show its characters through their speech and actions. However, so many of these characters act so annoying or stupid that you are just wishing for them to be killed off, and then the characters who are killed at the end by Thanos destroying half the population lacks any emotional weight because after nearly three hours of unbearable characters and dialogue, it is just a relief that the movie is almost over.The two things that ""Infinity War"" did well was not making the story feel jumbled and clustered with all of the characters, and they did do a good job with the characters of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany), but that is it. When it comes to everything else, the movie falls prey to a term film critic Roger Ebert used, which is 'idiot plot.'Idiot plot means that the only way for the plot to happen is for the characters to act like idiots, which I already went into a little bit to explain how even the smartest of characters have to act like morons in this movie for the plot to progress, but the entire plot of the movie is an idiot plot as well. Thanos' plan to wipe out half of the population only makes sense to the point of his backstory. In execution, it is a plan that falls apart and becomes dumber the more you think about it. This might be, though, because the movie tries to paint Thanos and his plan off as having depth to it, but this sort of plan would only make sense and work for a generic super hero villain who just wants to destroy the world because he is evil. So, with a villain with faux-depth and an evil plan that would only work for a generic super villain character, the overall plot of the movie is a dumb villain scheme that has awful juxtaposition to it.""Infinity War,"" to put it simply, is just awful. Nothing more, nothing less. And for a movie this big that had a decade of hype and buildup and planning, that is just sad.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","imaxxing","3 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. 
That being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. 
Infinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.
 
So, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.Great CGI.No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.Too many characters.The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. 
For the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.It bordered on a comedy.For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. 
While some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.Geared towards a younger audience. As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents. It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. 
Most of us have outgrown the cliches. Poor ending.Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling. A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film.Overall 6.4/10","

But just think of this for a moment.The film was literally;Villian comes on the scene, whichever avengers is around flies or runs at them. Gets bounced back. Flies again, gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back.Then an escape happens, as the villian always gets what he come for as even his minions are way too powerful for every single avenger in the film. Cue literally 2mins of wisecracking and jokes. Next scene cuts eslewhere, villian comes on the scene, avenger flies or runs at them, gets bounced back, then 2 more mins of wisecracking and jokes..... for 2 and a half hours.The diaglogue is minimal in the extreme. Possibly only 200 or so words get said in total throughout the whole 2 and a half hour movie. Almost all of it is just filler wisecracking jokes.Watching this movie honestly felt like watching someone else play a video game, with the 2min cut scenes kept in.I don't know if I am getting old, or if it was just this film but I did not enjoy this. I loved black panther that I seen a month ago. But also hated Justice Leage so am not sure. I get the feeling kids will love this and think it the most epic thing they have ever seen.

Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings .","

"Avengers: Infinity War","dcortner-19918","10 January 2024","The best Marvel movie to date IMO. Fantastic all-around. The pacing was spot on, and I was very concerned about it going in. I thought I'd be feeling bored or dragging around the 2hr mark. But when Thanos reached Wakanda, I knew things were ending soon and I actually remember thinking I didn't want it to end.The cast were all stellar in their roles. Love Cap's new look. Really enjoyed seeing RDJ back on-screen as Iron Man as well. Tom Holland really surprised me with how emotional that Spider-Man death scene was. The ""I don't want to go"" got to me.I thought we'd get some exposition or the Avengers reuniting in some capacity first, but I'm glad we opened with a Thanos attack. It helped establish the pace and set the tone. The movie kept that tone throughout. Thanos is a badass, but I also really enjoyed seeing his backstory and character. In his own twisted way, he definitely did care for Garmora. The relief on his face at the end was a really strong moment. He completed his goal, in his eyes he's done the universe a great justice and now he can just relax.I do hope that at least Loki & Gamora stay dead. I understand those that vanished are going to come back but I think bringing those 2 back would be a bit extreme.I thought for sure Tony Stark or Steve Rodgers were going to bite the bullet in this one. But it just makes me that much more intrigued to see where things go from here.Also, I have to shoutout the score. The music in this film was incredible. I'm not familiar with Alan Silvestri but he did an amazing job. The score enhanced every single scene, and helped immerse me into this world. Fantastic work.","

At least make the fight big.The writing got worse when the Guardians of the SJW Galaxy took the screen - cardboard characters wisecracking their way through vacant scenes.In fact, that's most of the movie. Most of the men act like 12 year old boys, arguing at the drop of a hat. That's supposed to be Stark's gimmick, but most of the heroes (males) act that way. There's no difference between Stark, Peter Parker or even Dr. Strange or even his Buddhist buddy.Most of the dialogue is banter. Mostly the so called actors pose their way through scenes. The fight scenes are so CGI and camera movement heavy that it's impossible to tell what's happening.The movie made a lot of money - a lot of people love the Emperor's new suit.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","ProfGenki","31 August 2020","..but still 10/10. Or 9.5 if its possible.The MCU has been very consistent in their filmmaking and I am happy that Infinity War absolutely delivers.
I am happy that it feels like and is a Thanos movie, a movie about a giant purple men who is here not because to kill smth but to fullfil his deep inner beliefs which is well written and understandable for the audience.
The level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.This movie is not perfect. Jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and Peter Quills occurence with Thanos at Titan is not well thought out. I wish there would be a better solution.Still. 10 years developement of a consistent franchise. And in the end a purple men with a not so empty heart wins. ITS GREAT.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","SnoopyStyle","11 May 2018","The Avengers face their most powerful opponent yet in Thanos. Thanos is collecting the six Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet to execute his evil plan. The heroes of the MCU struggle to stop him.It is amazing that this works as well as it does. This could be best described as The Empire Strikes Back portion of the MCU so far. The heroes get their butts kicked from one end of the universe to the other. It ends with a mass disintegration which is honestly even sadder and much darker than TESB. TESB ends bittersweet but this is just dark. Although anybody with a brain would see that the snap will be reversed in some way. There are many deaths that cannot happen which does diminishes the shock value of the ending. They can't kill off Spider-Man because the MCU doesn't even own him. Sony would never let it happen. They also can't kill off Black Panther due to his future movie and more importantly, his new popularity. Obviously, some characters will not make it but I think the vast majority will rise from the dead. The constant death reversals in the MCU saps away the shock value and that's probably this movie's main drawback. If they picked different characters to disintegrate, I might have doubts about reversing it.The advantage of the MCU is that these characters are so familiar that none of them needs introduction. In fact, this one starts from the end of Thor: Ragnarok and is no worst off by it. The relationships are well established. It's great fun to have them run into other heroes they've never met. Thor joining the Guardians generates a whole lot of hilarity. Drax is especially funny. Quill's insecurities is fun. There is an interesting pairing of Stark and Dr. Strange with Spider-Man as a fun sidekick. Relationships continue to be the strength of this franchise. The heroes are so well defined that the movie can spend its time with the villain. One of this franchise's weakness has always been the lackluster villains but Thanos is allowed to have his character development. His view points and his love for his daughter Gamora give him real depth. In many ways, this is Thanos' movie and it is more compelling due to the development.I do have some other minor issues. The giant Dinklage may be oddly cute at first but it's just odd. That section doesn't have the same action as Wakanda. Thor holding open the iris is not much of an action scene. I'd rather have that section finish quicker without flipping back and forth there. I would push that section back into the middle. The plan for Vision's stone seems like a low percentage play and his reasoning for sacrificing himself seems much more poetic. There has to be a way to do a ""needs of the many"" scene earlier and end in the same place anyways. Overall, this is well-constructed, well-conceived, and well-made. Despite the darkness, it still has its fun. The plot never stalls. The villains are great. The heroes are never in doubt. The franchise continues to be in good hands.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","phoenixinvictus","6 August 2018","I can almost guess how the sequel is going to go... they are going to use some ridiculous time travel trick to undo all of Thanos damage. This two and a half hour movie was nothing more than a ten minute cameo for each actor to fight some alien.
The HUGE plot hole in this movie is Thanos ""plan"" and Ant-Man's mysterious absence in this movie. Let's see how absurd the plot hole of this movie is... Thanos' master plan is to wipe out half the population of the Universe because according to him there aren't enough resources for us all. Have you seen the size of the Universe??? The resources are almost endless! The Universe is a BIG place people! How can anyone not point that out to him? With his magic gauntlet complete he can just ""magic"" all the resources he wants with the snap of his fingers. Duh! But that is not all... Ant-Man possesses the technology to END WORLD HUNGER!!! All he needs to do is supersize ""a steak"" to the size of a ""truck"" and presto you can feed an entire city for weeks. Right there is the weapon to end Thanos' dumb logic.
Almost right in the beginning of the movie Thanos kills off the Asgardians on the ship, except for the main characters because... well just because we'll dump logic out of window and not bother the audience. Thanos then kills Loki-for REAL this time. Let me please have a moment to laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA! Even if Loki is really dead this time I cannot feel anything but amusement at this ridiculous death for he has died so many times that I have lost count! Why should I feel sorry for a guy who wanted humans to worship him as a living god? Wasn't this the guy who literally placed his father in an old folks home to rot away? Wasn't he the one responsible for starting a war of genocide? Wasn't he the one who was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people and caused the near destruction of New York City? Wasn't he the one who caused the invasion of New York City by aliens?
Let's face facts! Nearly every Marvel character has died and been brought back to life that it actually is getting boring!
Heimdall who is wounded uses the last of his powers to transport Hulk\Bruce Banner to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers instead of-I don't know- beaming the tesseract away from Thanos. How about sending it to the edge of the Universe? It's not like he has a locating beacon to find these things.
Gamora wants to stay away from Thanos because she knows something that he wants and makes Star Lord promise her he will kill her (yeah right). Gamora then does the very thing she said she wouldn't do and runs directly to Thanos to engages him in battle where we all know that she will lose.
Aliens attack New York again. What an unlucky city. Doctor Strange is abducted and Wong doesn't seem to care that his friend is in danger and returns home... Really Wong, I'm so disappointed with you! Why doesn't he open up a portal to rescue his BFF? I know that Doctor Strange wouldn't have abandoned him... of course there is the fact that Wong's ten minutes were up and the studio couldn't afford him. Okay Wong I forgive you. Doctor Strange doesn't use his magic gem to turn back time and ""bargain"" with Thanos. Why doesn't he do it? With the help of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spiderman and Star Lord they hatch up a ""plan"" to remove the magic gauntlet off Thanos rather than just cut off the guy's arm off! Star Lord being the screw up that he is screws up the entire plan. Doctor Strange simply gives up the time gem because it's the only way to prolong this agonizing movie for another hour! Why didn't I just stop watching this movie?
Captain America who is a fugitive is suddenly pardoned because he is just so darn good looking and awesome in his costume. Vision says that he won't trade a life for a life but there were so many lives lost during the battle to remove the stone from his head. Wakanda is invaded and the Hulk refuses to come out of the closet... So why was he saved and not someone else? Does anyone care? Why didn't Wong and his friends appear in the final battle and lock the evil alien army into the ""mirror dimension""? I'm just saying... Everyone dies and we all know that they aren't going to stay that way. These movies get worse and worse each year.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","robert-85923","11 May 2018","I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular.However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly. At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before. I just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle... When it finally did end I felt cheated of the time.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","antialias11","13 May 2018","*** Warning, mild spoilers ahead *** Ok, what sticks out about this movie? Nothing much. 
The acting is lackluster. No character has a character arc - understandable because none of them are given any significant screen time. The whole movie is basically one endless 3-hour brawl (with some battle scenes blatantly ripped from Star Wars/Lord of the Rings). Some of the brawls are so over-the top that they are ludicrous (even by comicbook standards). Example: When you break a moon into pieces and hurl all of them at someone on the planet below within one second then the impacting pieces should not just make a puff of dust when they land. The motivation of the villain makes no sense (after achieving his goal the universe will just be back to the earlier situation soon enough). Given that it's hard to emote with a villain in the first place having a full CGI villain makes it even less likely. Some of Gamoras mood swings in the matter where we're supposed to emote with him or her make even less sense.Speaking of CGI: It's on a level we've come to expect with some weird exceptions. E.g. in one instance we see Bruce Banner's head in the open cockpit of the Hulkbuster armor while he's standing around in the background - and it looks like someone just copied it in with MS-Paint. Seriously. Not even Photoshop quality but MS-Paint.The humor is relegated to one-liners and most don't land. The serious one-liners are predictable and pithy. 
The music score is effective if somewhat over-the-top pathos-heavy (but that's not unusual for US films, so it' one of those things we've come to expect to have to endure)The overwhelming feeling is that this movie was ""designed by comittee"". The boardroom idea seems to have been: ""Take the things that people enjoyed in other movies and make them non-stop"". 
Problem is: It doesn't work that way. Gems in movies are that because they are rare. Taking the time to lead up to them makes the payoff all that sweeter.After coming back I rewatched the first Avengers movie just to see if my memory deceived me. But no: It is a way, way, WAY superior film in every respect.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Jared_Andrews","5 May 2018","Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection. There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges. Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all. I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts. Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does.The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve.So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea. For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless.Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected. The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians. The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. 
Spiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony ""Mr. Stark"" and Tony calls Peter ""kid."" There's a certain father-son/mentor-protégé sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever.Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music.Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints.1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him ""Vizz"" is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention.
2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it.
3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie.Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did. Join the phenomenon and see Infinity War today. If you love superheroes, you will probably love this movie.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","gavinp9","25 April 2018","SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much. The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista). The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.","

And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","MxS7HGS","28 January 2024","Infinity War is a favorite among superhero fans. It tells the story of how the Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, confront Thanos, an Eternal, who is determined to gather all six infinity stones and wipe out half of the universe's population. The fate of the universe rests on their shoulders.It begins with a high stakes opening sequence on a ship, where Thanos and his children are introduced with well-written dialogue and a powerful score by Alan Silvestri. The Hulk's confrontation with Thanos showcases the sheer might of the Eternal, establishing him as a formidable adversary for the Avengers.Despite a large cast of characters, it balances them well without feeling overstuffed. It tells a compelling story in two and a half hours, maintaining consistently fast pacing. It features notable performances from actors like Josh Brolin, who plays Thanos with great intensity and Robert Downey Jr., who delivers some of the best-acted emotion in the entire MCU, adding depth to his character.However, some parts of the movie are criticized for feeling contrived or lacking in visual appeal. For example, the moment when Starlord punches Thanos feels forced, and the CGI and aging effects on certain suits are questionable.Despite these flaws, Infinity War is a monumental achievement in the MCU's early phases and stands as a convincing assertion that these films are indeed a form of cinema.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","realmuthaf","6 May 2018","Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good.The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway.There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone ""for balance"" with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah.Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around.I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable. This, however, just continues the downward trend of movies like Guardians 2 and Thor 3.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Shadowboy_25cm","23 November 2021","""Avengers: Infinity War"" culminates the 10 years build-up of the MCU to this first part finale:The villain is very powerful, complex and interesting to watch, although his final art design is not that impressive as other impressive versions of Thanos.There is a lot of super-hero drama, a lot of apocalyptic atmosphere, a lot of smart subplots and impressive locations, there is a lot of surprise.The movie is very watchable and constructed somehow around best-of-scenes, very fast-paced, jumping from one important fight and conflict to another leaving behind some logic. The action and the SFX are impressive, I as a viewer have nearly none time to chill out,
it's a tour de force till the final battle. Very courageous by the makers to finish this movie as a Part 1-movie of a 2-part-finale (just like the new ""Dune"" movie by Denis Villeneuve in 2021).It's a good MCU movie (it's better than the second part ""Avengers: Endgame"") that relies on the former MCU movies to keep it as a fast-paced, gripping story till the end.Highly recommended.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","maruugaa","18 May 2018","I'm not a fan of Marvel or DC or basically anything that Disney creates. Unfortunately, my friend wanted to see it and I figured:
1) There's a chance it could be good, considering there were other movies I thought were going to be bad, such as(Blockers, The Purge, Keanu, and even Wonder Woman) that turned out to be good, so I shouldn't pass this off right away just because it's Disney
2) I figured it couldn't be worse than Red Sparrow.Anyway, I was wrong to both of those. This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence.The only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade.The entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life.With the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class. Also, as someone who was forced to go to Catholic Church as a kid, if you've ever gone to the Good Friday or Palm Sunday mass where they all read that dialogue in monotonous voices that's so insufferable you're in pain? That's how I felt in this movie. I would've rather been a child at Good Friday mass again, because at least then there was prospect of a Cream Egg for sitting through that drawl.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","PedanticEditor","2 June 2018","This movie is shockingly bad, especially compared with the other avengers films, and is the absolute worst Marvel movie ever made. Almost as bad as the Batman vs. Superman movie was for the DC universe. Fair warning, this review is all spoilers - not that it really matters since you shouldn't see the film anyway.I saw the film today and I can't help but conclude that the writers of this film were just lazy. For shame! I get that Infinity War is supposed to be the first part of a two-parter, so pretty much all the good guys had to die. But there are ways of making good guys lose without having them act like lobotomy patients throughout the whole story and literally die from stupidity every step of the way (oh, except for Spiderman who is inexplicably the only intelligent character in the story). In what ways were the good guys unbelievably dumb every step of the way, you ask? I'll tell you. And then I'll tell you what some better written alternatives could have been. This is just from memory, so there are probably more instances of bad writing that I've forgotten.1. Loki gives up a stone to save Thor, even though it may be possible to resurrect him later and Loki knows half the universe will die as an eventual result.2. Loki goes after the more-powerful-than-gods Thanos a moment later with a knife. An effing knife!3. The first thing Dr. Strange does is as Ironman for help. Whaa?4. Dr. Strange gets tangled up in weeds and faints, then to be carried off like a swooned and helpless fairytale maiden.5. Gamora attacks Thanos first, by herself, even though she knows she alone holds the key to a stone.6. Gamora gives up the final stone to relieve her sister from momentary torture, knowing that half of all life in the universe will die as a result.7. Wakanda opens its forcefield, and the super-duper powerful lady stops guarding the last stone in order to fight.8. Star Lord prevents the other good guys from removing the infinity stone holder from Thanos by deliberately saving Thanos from the mind control lady.9. Ironman didn't punch Star Lord's lights out when he saw that he was getting ready to do something moronic.10. Neither did Dr. Strange.11. Thor stabs the Thanos through the chest with a super-axe (which was obviously stupid in the first place, but even then he has time to pull it back out and chop off the baddy's head), and instead the baddy says ""You should have gone for the head"" and sucks himself into a portal to escape.12. Last, and least important but still annoying, the Hulk is effectively impotent for no good reason.Here are 3 Possible solutions off the top of my head that would have been less poorly written:1. Dr. Strange is distracted by something even more important for the entire movie, so that the other heroes can die tragically, and in the second movie he stops being too busy and just rolls back time and undoes Thanos' acquisition of the stones - also causing the heroes to not die.2. Same thing, except Dr. Strange or his compatriot could have opened up and closed one of their portal thingies to snip off Thanos' arm with the stones on it.3. Thor could have died trying to make the super-axe, or he could have cut off Thanos' head and someone else evil could quickly put on the stone-holding glove thing instead. Either way would have been an improvement.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","rowpotdroid","29 April 2018","Suffering hype fatigue, over a year of industry talk about this movie in pre release. It takes away from viewing the movie. In the end it's just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age. The first avengers was original. But now what Hollywood movie makers due best, take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs. Sorry about raining on your Hollywood comic book Heroes block borer. But the only hero I can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels. They've become boring and predictable recycles. I spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie. Seems Hollywood is addicted to CGI for making movies that shouldn't be made. If they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up, no story, plot or actors acting just things blowing up.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","bob the moo","27 August 2018","I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","bradykitchen-33648","15 March 2022","This film is phenomenal. I have no other way of putting it, they do a amazing job especially with how big this film is. The Russo brothers do a crazy good job with managing this huge cast. Every character is given some sort of purpose and their time to shine and it makes for through the roof entertainment but also a well written movie.This film has a really big advantage over other MCU films, all of the characters except for one have been developed. It allows the movie to focus far more on the plot and making a quality story and less so on showing who these characters are. This movie is very fast paced, which creates what is the most entertaining MCU film.The one character that was developed was Thanos played by Josh Brolin. He is the best MCU villain because he was developed. Almost all of the MCU films have one issue and that is the villain. Most MCU villains are not given enough development to be considered a good villain. Thanos is the polar opposite. This film does an amazing job of explaining his character and explaining his motive. There are a few times where you actually ponder whether he is right and that shows how well written Thanos is.The action in this film is insanely well managed. You get to see each character have their action moment and makes for a really entertaining watch. The comedy was also very good and I feel they managed it a lot better than other MCU instalments. I find a lot of MCU projects use comedy at inappropriate times whereas this film did not.In terms of gripes there were a lot of plot holes, which is hard to fault them on because of how much they already have to deal with but plot holes are there and they need to be mentioned.Overall this film is amazing. The Russos do an insane job with managing this giant cast while providing the best MCU villain to date.9.5/10.","

The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies.

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheNabOwnzz","2 August 2018","Since i am not a little boy that has an absurd kind of fondness for Marvel comics & thus its movies, i am able to judge them objectively without being prejudiced by a couple of adults flying around in capes. And with this knowledge, it is quite obvious that Infinity War is indeed objectively a terrible movie.As stated before i am admittedly not a Marvel fan, and i did not care to watch any of its predecessors before this one. It ofcourse should never be a requirement to watch about 18 films in order to comprehend this one better, but to be honest you really don't miss anything during Infinity War's simplistic narrative if you have missed all its previous films, except for maybe knowing the characters in it. But judging from what i have seen none of them are even slightly relatable even when having watched previous films. So even if you have watched previous films, a connection with these characters is impossible since they are so terrible written and often times poorly acted.First off, i cannot fathom enough how terrible the screenplay is. A couple of characters try to be funny and come up with lines of dialogue a 8 year old could have though of, such as: 'Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards' or 'Why is Gamora', or the discussion about Thor's new haircut. The plain stupidity in its dialogue and writing is basically an insult to the audience's intelligence, and thus it is a very dumb and low IQ motion picture due to this. The acting is mostly terrible, except by perhaps Josh Brolin ( Which is saying a lot, since he was a pure CGI character ). Especially Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt & Tom Holland all hand in absolutely atrocious and horrendous performances. All of them try to be funny and joke around in serious times, but it is never funny, instead its terrible pretentious attempt at creating wisecracks results in loads of cringeworthy scenes that will make the audience embarrassed to witness. Although in the three actors's defence, the abysmal script didn't help their performances either, and they are only partly to blame.The only interesting character in the film is Thanos, and while it does help a little bit that he has the most screen time of all characters by far, he still seems to be a victim of the cliché fest that is Infinity War since his reasons for wanting to take over the world are hardly original ( Sacrifice the few to save the many kind of motivations, which we have all seen before ), and can probably be found in the 'Standard Hollywood villain rules guide book' anywhere. None of the 'Good guys' are relatable because their dialogue is so ridiculous and since the only intelligent person in the film seems to be Thanos, as everybody else seems to be lacking in self awareness and self consciousness on every level ( Especially all the times people who know what Thanos is capable of keep attacking him like they think they have a chance, what a joke that is ).There is once again a lot of sub par plastic cinematography with many artificial backdrops, especially in Wakanda. None of it seems particularly natural, and thus the film also has this visually artificial kind of feel that further decreases your immersion ( Although the characters already decreased this pretty far down with their terrible dialogue ). There is no depth or real sub text in the film except perhaps Thanos showing little Gomora his knife balancing which symbolizes his view of a world in balance, but that is pretty much all the cleverness in it. It also has a lot of melodramatic scenes ( Especially with Vision and that redhead woman whose name i forget ) between characters that you cannot relate with, and the only thing that i wanted to see happen was Thanos killing them all, as he was the only individual with even a slightly bit of depth or character, thus making only him, the villain, relatable. Ofcourse as is standard in modern films Infinity War is also very politically correct in that it uses a lot of women warriors fighting like men against eachother in order to negate gender differences like there are none, which further enhances the notion that this is ultimately an irrelevant film.Admittedly the only strength this film might have comes from Thanos's character, and everything else seems irrelevant due to terrible acting & writing. In the end, despite that a lot of characters meet their demise, it still feels as though nothing is really at stake because all the characters are frequently making unfunny jokes & dumb decisions, which in turn leads to the question: 'Why should we care?'","

That is not true and if you're too blind to see that this movie was worse than Age of Ultron, which comparably was pretty bad itself, but this takes the cake and you shouldn't watch, or rate, superhero movies. Don't for a moment think that Avengers: Endgame will be any better. When you write a film so full of plot holes that it may as well have been filmed through a cheese grater, you should not be praised as great directors, or even called writers at that point either. You should be bent over the knee and spanked and then scolded for writing, and directing such a bad movie.I've never uttered these words before but Ang Li's Hulk with Eric Banna was better than this film.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","PedroReviews","30 January 2024","Avengers: Infinity War, the culmination of Marvel Studios' decade-long superhero saga, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that defies expectations and delivers an exhilarating and emotionally resonant experience. The film masterfully weaves together a multitude of storylines, bringing together an ensemble of beloved Marvel heroes to confront their most formidable foe yet: Thanos, the ruthless cosmic warlord seeking to restore balance to the universe by wiping out half of all living beings.At the heart of Avengers: Infinity War lies a complex and compelling narrative that explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the delicate balance of fate. The film challenges conventional superhero tropes, questioning the very nature of heroism and the cost of saving the world. Thanos, portrayed with chilling intensity by Josh Brolin, emerges as a formidable villain driven by a twisted sense of righteousness, adding a layer of moral ambiguity to the story.The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing the impressive power and skill of each Avenger. From the intense clash between the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos's Black Order on the planet Titan to the epic showdown in Wakanda, the film delivers a visually stunning and visceral spectacle that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, Avengers: Infinity War excels in its character development, giving each Avenger ample screen time to shine. We witness the growth and evolution of beloved characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, while also introducing new heroes who make their mark, including the brilliant Doctor Strange and the enigmatic Scarlet Witch.The film's emotional impact is profound, as we witness the bonds of friendship and camaraderie forged among the Avengers tested to their limits. The loss of beloved characters is handled with sensitivity and depth, adding a layer of tragedy and realism that makes the stakes feel incredibly high.Avengers: Infinity War's most defining moment, the one that will forever be etched in the minds of MCU fans, is the ending that leaves half of all life in the universe decimated. This shocking and heartbreaking twist serves as a devastating conclusion to the film, leaving the audience reeling with questions and anticipation for the future of the MCU.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","AlsExGal","26 August 2018","Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan? The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (""Stop Thanos""), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","radursm","3 May 2018","Not everything that glitters is gold! I'd say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars.
Returning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.
The last ""Avengers"" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.
Yes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine.But the ""Avengers"" franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back.
""Infinity War"" is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It's a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.
I quote a friend: What's the fool, the one who wrote the screenplay or the one who laughed at the jokes of the ""Guardians of Galaxy""?","

Had too little screen time to be an effective character (all characters) and fit in the plotline effectively. 2. This ties in to not enough screen time, lack of emotional connection to the characters. I simply didn't care that half of the characters died by the end of the movie. Because we all know that most if not all characters are going to return anyway in future movies, it's a financial decision on Marvel's behalf. We all know that these characters are cash cows for Marvel studios so why care that they died when we all know they are going to come back anyway.... 3. Plotline, it had potential but due to time limits done by the studio and editing team it wasn't fully developed (Yes I understand half of you are going to say 'but I want my movie to be an hour and half and mindless fun'. and to rebut that, you can look this up here on imdb, 90%+ of movies that have made the most money and have the highest ratings are at least 2 and half hours long, most being over 3 hours so don't claim to represent the majority). 4. I would have liked this movie a lot more if they would have split it up into 2 movies, which would have been warranted with the material they were using in the movie.

Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a cliché, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...","

"Avengers: Infinity War","jmichael3387","4 May 2018","I wasn't expecting much going in. I figured it would be all action, since there are so many characters. But I at least thought some of the action would be entertaining. But it wasn't. Not one action scene was any good. Thor Ragnarok was a masterpiece compared to this. This movie was truly dreadful. My girlfriend, who normally likes any superhero movie that's action-packed, even though this movie stunk. Many boring scenes of talking....all about nonsense. Because when every single character can do absolutely anything....when every character has powers that are limitless....like for instance, let's go to outer-space, let's teleport, let's shoot a rope that curves 20 times and wraps around our opponent....when anyone can do anything....the result is total boredom after a short while. The 9.0/10 rating here is Fake News, I guarantee you that. Statistically impossible....especially for such a bad movie. I was sooo bored.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","SamALMan","9 May 2018","I am not a comic fan.. I never read printed materials on infinity war and now after watching this movie I feel if I have the chance to read it, I will.Anyway.. the movie started where one of the most recent Marvel studio movies ended, Thanos is on quest to collect all the infinity stones to proceed with his plan and while doing so he faces opposition attempts by the avengers and others.You will definitely feel shaken by the first scene in this movie and the shock won't wear out by that scene.. Thanos is determined to collect all the infinity stones even the one that is unknown whereabouts to Marvel movies fans to fulfill his aim.. the aim that made his quest to collect infinity stones understood and analyzed. It hold a real nice philosophical thought that really worth all the time to analyze. The visuals were amazing in this movie, specially for Thanos and the new characters. You can read emotions better on the main ""computer constructed"" character, they are very close to the emotions that you may be able to read from human real face. It is a fast based movie with few ""quiet"" scenes and short scenes with slight laughs here and there to lighten the mood. The characters who appear in this movie have varied screen time but it is noticeable even when some characters get longer screen time, they do not overshadow the efforts of other characters that have lesser screen time. The movie is definitely aiming to please group of audience that appreciate certain types of jokes and references. ********** SPOILER Begin**************
There were no introduction to Thano's snap.. by looking back at Thano's reasons to kill people, I never find it connected to the moment where he snapped his fingers.. he snapped as a impulse or reaction to an avenger attack.. his reasons where corrupted by emotions!.. but definitely showing that Thanos would do anything to have this power in his collection. 
********** SPOILER end**************Marvel studios started a huge project with multiple layers and stages that will make it impossible to wrap it as a perfect project.. you will definitely see slips here and there specially when the other Marvel studios productions seemed connected to this movie. At the end I would say that this movie is more suitable to young audience (to me 40 years and younger). Comics started as a ""relief"" and ended to be an ""art"".. This movie is one of the good examples of a nice modern comic movie.","

That movie was freaking epic.Thanos is at long last (after Hela) one worthy opponent for the Avengers - almost too worthy. The way they managed to give everyone some screentime and even do it well was exceptional! It was just so cool and funny and suspenseful!I'm sad for the Asgardian people, though. And since when is Wanda this strong? It's a bit disappointing that the infinity stone wielder Vision himself seems to be that weak.When Thor was about to beat the crap out of Thanos, holy moly. That was one epic move.I can see that I'm not even sure what to write since there is not so much plot but rather the movie is just filled with action. It was definitely a blast.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","brsmarc","23 May 2018","WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI went to see AIW in the hopes of washing away the taste of mediocrity of Black Panther. Having seen pretty much most the other Avengers franchise and predominantly liking them I thought BP was a deviation from the norm but, I now see with AIW's this might be the new normal.This color by numbers film is probably what the average fanboy would hope for: formulaic plot, a who's who of super characters, an odd and apparently solipsistic villain, a barrage of special effects, machines of destruction and a few melodramatic emotionless bonding moments.The entire two hours and twenty odd minutes ends up being nothing more than a long, boring commercial for the sequel (which will also likely dupe the same crowd of lemmings) into forking over $10, $15, $20? for a ticket. The ""deeper"" interpretations will probably dwell on the conflicted nature of Thanos and his complex subtextual commentary of the state of diminishing resources in their world (hint, they mean our world) and the Orwellian double speak where, when he and his henchmen/women go on their intergalactic killing sprees they pronounce (without irony) that they are not murdering, they are liberating. This is the language of dictators, despots and mass murderers (Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler). His insatiable goal to collect the infinity stones for his special glove/gauntlet will give him ultimate power. How serious is this villain about gaining ultimate power? Well he actually trades away his soul (technically its not his) for the ""soul infinity stone"". Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.In this rendition, our friends from prior Marvel movies seem to be not marvelous at all. This is the foundation for every 8 yr old boys ""fighting argument"" (eg: Who would win if Aquaman fought Spiderman? Or ""who's stronger Hulk, Superman or Batman?) fun and engaging sure, if you're an eight year old boy.But what makes this movie such a mess is exactly the notion of more is better. You could put all your favorite foods together on a plate and one look would make you say, ""Yuck, this is disgusting""But its the weight of expectations, need to generate huge box office, and this kind of ""ultimate hero fantasy"" that makes you feel like ""lets simplify"".","

"Avengers: Infinity War","walentys","3 July 2019","The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for ""comedy"" is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a ""lighter"" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for ""comedy"" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film.Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing ""modern Marvel movies"" as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula.The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place?Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were ""just there"". No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into ""one united Avengers"" character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos.The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it.Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.","

I know this a two-parter and a lot of what happened will be rectified, but it was still a huge disappointment to me.

"Avengers: Infinity War","hotjanuary","13 May 2018","Infinity War is a good super hero movie. But I thought Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther were better.Marvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies.
1) if a battle between the Hulk and Thor in Ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat I'm pretty sure Hulk vs Thanos in a spaceship would last one punch.2) Star-lord is just a dude, he does not catch and hold Spider-man.3) If Tony Stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in Iron Man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in Waconda? I'm sure War Machine would have access to activate them.4) If Scarlet Witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near Wakonda why do 2 dudes in Scotland give her a hard time?5) Steve Rogers isn't invulnerable. When swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth he's apparently unharmed after Thor's hammer clears the baddies away. They had time to rip Steve up but didn't?Don't take the easy way out when writing the story. A lot of it was good but some of it was not. Writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief.
1) When an elaborate plan pins Thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he can't DESTROY THE UNIVERSE nobody would stop to talk to Thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe. At the very least you shut up and HELP REMOVE THE GAUNTLET so Thanos can't destroy the UNIVERSE!2) Gamora really thinks Thanos doesn't love her? All that time she was talking about Thanos not loving anyone made no sense. I kept thinking, Gamora, you're being really stupid, everybody knows what's going to happen... maybe you should try running or anything?3) When Thor arrives at Wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump/smash. Banner even feels he has time to stop, open his helmet to say ""You guys are so screwed now!"". But when all the heroes go to protect Vision from Thanos.... Thor arrives AFTER Thanos gets the last stone?I know I'm picking. It's because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and I'd rather not have anymore X-men The Last Stand or Fantastic Four (2015).","

It is yet again white people saving the Universe! Where did we hear that before! Also why does Marvel incorporated Thor, a greek god in their series and not for example the God Krishna from India? Towards the end there were so much of the same going on that you don't feel any empathy anymore of the entire Avengers crews when they died one by one, and you start to think the Universe might aswell be perished, who cares....cant stand the fact that this movies continue to go on and on, and wishing for it to end!

"Avengers: Infinity War","glofau","2 May 2018","A movie should stand on its own two feet as an entertainment experience. You shouldn't have to watch 18 other movies first in order to enjoy a film. Unfortunately, to enjoy Avengers: Infinity War, you really have to have seen all the other MCU films or this film doesn't really make any sense. Hell, they rarely even introduce characters by name, let alone give you any clue as to who these people are. It really takes shalllowness to a whole new level of yawn-inducing ennui.It's not like I haven't seen any other Marvel superhero movies; I've seen several. When I was a kid, I read the comic books. And I still had no clue who most of the characters in this movie were! And I certainly didn't give two hoots whether they lived or died.The film is a spectacular, eye-popping kaleidoscope of sumptuous costumes, special effects, and MONEY spent lavishly on just about everything. The salaries for the all-star cast alone must have sucked up a huge portion of the film's budget. But who cares? If you weren't already invested in the characters, you aren't going to become invested in this sea of nameless wisecrackers spewing rather clever (but pointless) dialogue endlessly.I couldn't make it to the end, I walked out about halfway through. I hear the end is the best part but I couldn't summon enough interest to care. They lost me with the meaningless major death early in the picture. Snore! I don't go to a film to see favorite characters bite the dust! Especially since they'll just have to resurrect people so they can make their various contracted sequels in their own franchises. This film is an expensive waste of time unless you're a rabid fan.It's all about the story, man! Without a good story and some time spent up front getting you invested in the main characters, a movie is nothing. Black Panther was terrific because it had a terrific script but this film sucked rocks because its script was a shallow, mediocre snooze despite the witty repartee. Don't bother unless you're a big fan of the MCU.","

there is no any fight I see from captaion and black panther, just a few punches.
even end was not that good. I thought this movie will be better than first one but now I know first one will always stay best from all.Tony didn't stay in earth and I didn't like it.
action scene were good but not compared to what we saw in civil war.
This is very big movie, there must be some scenes and actions which supposed to be unforgattable. You will also feel at least one time that this isn't movie about avengers or saving earth/universe. its about thanos and gamora story. good time wasted there. No complicated plots. plot holes. no combination of music/sound. 
no interesting and emotional plot like civil war and doc. strange movie.I hope next part will be better than this.

"Avengers: Infinity War","RoBiN_SinGH211221","30 September 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","

Thor and Hulk may not have beaten him, but they should have done more damage. On Thanos' home planet, even though he had multiple infinity stones, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Star Lord, Drax, and Mantis should have taken Thanos down with their collective strengths.And the ending.

"Avengers: Infinity War","ssatvaya-16480","19 June 2021","AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...
Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb .....,
Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".","

Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic cliché formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and cliché There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.","

No mean feat in a movie with this many awesome characters. Robert Downey Jr is as awesome as always (when isn't he??) as is Tom Holland, he made me cry, it not going to lie. Mark Ruffallo has more to do than normal as Bruce Banner.Chris Evans and Benedict Cumberbatch are more supporting here as is Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany (even though I was crushed with there final scene) Sadly, Scarlett Johansson is wasted here!!

"Avengers: Infinity War","kuaci89","26 April 2018","Just WOW , The Russo nailed it, hand down from me they did it again. Part by part is interesting to watch , some of scene make me shock some scene make me wanna punch people so bad. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones. One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it.Really worth watching it , if u non Marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch , really enjoy it . Of course every good movie always have some issue with it but just MINOR issue can close eye and let it go. Going to watch it again soon . Love from Malaysia.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","judemcrobbie","20 March 2021","I have basically nothing but praise for Avengers: Infinity War. Considering the rest of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are very safe and don't take many risks or deviate from their generic formula, this does. These movies will go down in cinema history, for better or for worse, and I do truly believe this deserves to be there.
There are plenty of reasons this is the best MCU instalment and one of the better movies of the decade:
The primary reason is the villain, Thanos. He played spectacularly by Josh Brolin, who even in motion capture gets all the acting through. The MCU has had such weak villains throughout so to see Thanos done so well is a great change. I think the genius behind how Thanos is the best villain is because the way the movie cleverly poses the question ""Could he be right?"". This gives him not only a sense of moral righteousness to us but we can truly see the ""No one thinks they're the villain"" philosophy making him so compelling. The opening scene of the movie shows the mad titan effortlessly slaughtering families in his quest to destroy half the population of the universe. He seems completely unfazed by this like he's done it before countless times. There is a clever line of exposition in this after this, not only backing it up that he has (That we will see a flash back showing he's been doing it for at least 20 years) but also how he got the first stone. I like this decision to say rather than show this as it puts us in the action of the people we actually have emotional resonance with, The Asgardians. Throughout this scene we see the two previously strongest characters, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), get not only beat down by Thanos but humiliated. This is especially prevalent in the hulk as we don't see the fight between Thor and Thanos. We do get to see the fight between The Hulk and Thanos however. This is one of the best set pieces in the franchise as not only is it bombastic action but also shows character for both of them, but especially Thanos. Through a mere few counterattacks, Thanos decimates The Hulk. This shows the brains he has, not fighting like the animal The Hulk does, and showing he also has the strength to go toe to toe with the previous strongest avenger. The genius behind the decision to show the brains is that t circles back to when in the final fight he says ""You're not the only one cursed with knowledge"". In this scene we also see the smarts of Thanos, outsmarting the God of Mischief-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He ultimately kills both Loki and Heimdall (Idris Elba), the final remaining people from Thor's previous life before the first Thor and the avengers. I think the next time we see Thanos on screen is in the Knowhere scene. In this he uses his grip over the weapons he has gathered, showing their abilities and his ability over them by cutting through The Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff) with ease and going as far as to turn our beloved Mantis and Drax into Spaghetti and just blocks respectively. There is a lot more in this scene which I could talk about, Peter's arrogance and the Guardians dysfunctional family ultimately leading to their downfall to the hand of a competent villain, but I will elect to talk on the emotional climax of the scene, Peter Quill attempting to kill the love of his life in order to save humanity but getting the rugged pulled out from underneath him. This leaves Peter in a complete state of disarray as if he had killed he would have felt immense guilt for killing the one true love of his life, and if he hadn't then he may have just doomed the universe. No win situations like these are perfect for developing character as we get to see them in difficult situations. This drives Peter and the rest of The Guardians the rest of the movie. There is two more Thanos scenes I would like to would like to talk about: the first of which is the Nebula torture scene. This is a truly perfect scene compared to the many others. Marvel has a tendency to crack jokes unnecessarily, which I'll get into later, but this is just completely devoid of all that humour which is just perfect. The fact Gamora says ""I always hated that chair"" and Thanos deciding to bring himself to the lower level, not feeling the need to assert his dominance over her sets up the next scene perfectly, and then the other thing in this scene is the decision for the 'Mad Titan' no to torture Gamora and instead torturing Nebula, again this makes the next scene perfectly. Then the final scene of the Thanos chat is the Vormir/Soul Stone scene. This scene is just chilling. When Red Skull (Ross Marquand) pronounces that you must give a soul you love for the soul stone, the reactions from both Thanos and Gamora are just amazing. Thanos goes completely silent, null and void he thinks over what he must do. The tear shed shows the pain perfectly set up in the previously alluded scene, but understanding he must do what he must do. In his eyes it means crossing the fate over the universe over his daughter and the only person he ever truly loved. Gamora in this scene is fantastic as well. She originally believes that Thanos doesn't love anyone and therefore he will fail, going as far as to taunt him about it. At the beginning the taunts come thick and fast but they slow down with her voice realising there's only one thing he loves. The climax of Gamora trying to kill herself instead of having to give the stone to Thanos is what makes the scene so great, giving the moral compass of The Guardians and she carries that to her grave ultimately.
Another reason for this being this being the best instalment in the franchise is because of the writing and acting for/from every character:
Iron Man is the man who started all this and Robert Downey Jr. gives a trademark performance. He brings the narcissism and arrogance that comes with the character. He also shows the swagger but more he brings arguably the fourth personality trait of Iron Man's tenure. This iteration brings the most human Iron Man. He has always had obsessions but in this the obsession is with having a child. This is started as far back as Captain America: Civil War (2016) with the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland). In this Spider-Man was easily the youngest superhero, he was still in high school, so Tony Stark saw him as a child, which later became his child of sorts. This is emanated as the same you want to push your child but not to the point of harm, Tony brings Peter Parker into the fight to expand the help for Team Iron Man or whatever it's called, but at the first sign of real danger he tells him to leave. This is carried over to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) where we see Iron Man as the mentor, Uncle Ben figure of the MCU. To those who don't understand that, Uncle Ben in Spider-Man is the man who teaches Peter humility and ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Tony Stark has this trait in this as he teaches Peter not to thrill-seek and do it for the greater cause, what Tony Stark had to learn 9 years prior in the first instalment of the MCU, Iron Man (2008). I say all of this because he gets annoyed at Peter for getting on the spaceship as he is fully aware that it could be a one way trip. The line Peter says ""I can't be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man if there's no neighbourhood"" encapsulates the lessons taught to him in the previous instalments of his character in other MCU movies. Then to see Peter die in his arms has to be the killing blow, comparable to losing a child. Not only does Tony feel this, but because of all the time spent developing their relationship in other movies and this one, we the audience also feel this like the dagger Tony Stark has just been stabbed with, both physically and emotionally. The back and forth between Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Iron Man is brilliant, it evokes the feeling when two of the worlds greatest but heads, like Messi and Ronaldo or Lebron and Curry. The ""I speak for myself"" from Doctor Strange is completely unnecessary and he just affirms Tony Stark's point but it shows however on the same tea, they are very much at each other's throats. This is even more apparent when in the spaceship Tony and Peter save Doctor Strange by blowing a hole and releasing the vacuum. Doctor Strange doesn't thank the pair but proceeds to make an indirect threat to them, saying he will not hesitate to not save them in aid to keep the Time stone. Also another 'alpha' character in Peter Quill joins them on Titan. This throws another problem as he has no willingness to listen to anyone but himself.
Thor is clearly fighting out of vengeance towards Thanos. Though not all by the hand of Thanos, in the last 3 features of Thor he has lost his father-Odin (Anthony Hopkins), his mother-Frigga (Rene Russo), his brother-Loki, and his four of his best friends in Heimdall and the warriors three (Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano). This man has seen everyone die around him so the guilt he must feel is through the roof. This is said by Mantis when trying to empathise with him. He is very much motivated in this by vengeance, it is because of this he is so powerful as he has ""Nothing left to lose"". This gives Thor the reckless abandon needle to take on Thanos alone or take the weight of a star to form his weapon. The will to take the weight, heat and energy of a star shows how much he was connected to Mjolnir. In very much way the the Tardis feels like a person in Doctor Who (1963-Present), Mjolnir had a sense around it that it was more than just a weapon, not just how Thor and it interacted but it's perfect timing and the noise it makes feeling like a language. Speaking of people Thor has lost, Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was destroyed early by Hela (Cate Blanchett). There isn't enough words doc for me to get it all in","

"Avengers: Infinity War","daendil","6 May 2018","Warning: spoilers.There is not much one anticipates from a superhero movie. Spectacle (with lots of CGI), iconic characters, some basic story arc, and saving the world in the end.
Infinity War didn't deliver. And I hate to utter that. I hate to command movies to stay within they genre... But if they don't, there must be reason. There must be good reason. The makers stripped this movie of the most important superhero-flick-features and what remains, just falls apart.First of all, there are way too many characters (could this have been the reason behind the ""end result""?). And then the story arc: it's a downward spiral. The heroes try to stop the villain(s) at multiple locations only to fail one time after another, letting the villain march through with his plan and collect each and every one of the stones. And finally the world is not saved. The end. Cast. Oh, wow. Thank you.Now for the spectacle: that was ok - though most of the fight scenes were too shaky and chaotic for me. I would have preferred less and more detailed scenes, but I don't complain. It a little bit felt like a Japanese anime though, where one combatant pulls a big ass weapon only to have their opponent pull an even bigger ass weapon, and on and on, until one time an entire moon (!) was dropped onto our heroes...For the positives: we did have some good laughs, and the main villain is well detailed (for a superhero movie). Also, Peter Dinklage!Lastly I hate to be blackmailed to watch next episode like this. So no, I will not watch the next one, at least not in the movie theater.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","BA_Harrison","28 April 2018","A mean, ugly purple dude scours the universe for the pretty gems that fit into his snazzy metal gauntlet, intent on using the power of the stones for his own nefarious needs. It is up to a team of brave superheroes to try and stop him.I've fallen way behind on my MCU, and am probably not the best person to comment on this latest instalment; or maybe, just maybe, my objectivity makes me more suited than most avid fanboys.For the best part of two hours I was reasonably entertained by what unfolded, despite not knowing the backstory to several of the characters. The plot was pretty easy to pick up, the action scenes were visually impressive, and there was never a lull in pace. It was slick, big-budget popcorn fodder designed to appeal to the masses, but which hardly qualified as revolutionary or indeed, all that memorable. Eventually, I could feel tedium creeping in. And then the last act changed everything...The finalé, in which half the population of the entire universe ceases to exist, makes Avengers: Infinity War a movie that lingers in the mind long after it has ended. Spiderman, gone. Dr. Strange, gone. Black Panther, gone. Groot, gone. And many more besides. Well-established characters vanish in the blink of an eye, and I have to admit feeling a lump in my throat at their casual dismissal. It's a bold move, for sure, and one that will guarantee discussion from all that stay the distance (which reminds me, be sure to remain seated for the now obligatory after credits scene).6/10 for the first two hours or so, but that ending... I'll be generous and add a couple of extra points for Marvel having the balls to go ahead with it.***EDIT*** Having pondered the fate of so many superheroes, I now expect Marvel to bring most of them back to life in the next film via Dr. Strange's powers of time manipulation-not such a ballsy move after all. My rating might be reduced to 7/10 if this is the case.***","

"Avengers: Infinity War","plasticanimalz","15 July 2018","I wasn't going to bother with a review but then I read the first review by blparker that said everyone giving this a bad score were trolls who didn't see the film, then went on to praise it like it was Citizen Kane. I found that rather humorous. My suggestion is to see this in the theatre as the VFX are the only thing it has going for it and won't translate on the small screen. I had no idea this was a 2 hr and 40 min film until I bought the ticket and I seriously contemplated walking into another film because I just did not expect much from this film. When the film started it poorly leapt straight into a scene as if we were in the middle of the movie rather than the beginning. It didn't make a lot of sense other than a set up for on of the long-standing characters to die. Once we moved past this terrible scene it got a little better, which kept me in my seat 'cause the first 10 mins of the film made me want to leave the movie as I was afraid the rest of the film would be like this. It doesn't get much better but at the very least it manages to be entertaining.There is a plot, though, there is very little to it. If you know anything of the Infinity comic, which also was not that great, you know that a lot of characters die. The difference is they killed characters in the comic I cared about and the movies they don't even bother to have those characters, so, whatever. Secret Wars was a much better comic and tells how Spider-Man got his black suit, but it had actual story, so, I guess they didn't want to use a better comic. Infinity truly is one big dude fight. But not even that exciting of action. I thought the Black Panther action was better. I'd read that a bunch of guys don't like Rey from Star Wars because she's a Mary Sue, which I learned means a woman with ultimate, unstoppable powers. Funny, I've never heard a name for guys but they bothered to come up with one for women. Basically, every dude in this film is a Mary Sue. If Thor has the power to resist a star how is it he can't get out of a couple steel girders a wizard wraps around him? How is Captain America always so invincible? He was always kind of a lame character but now he's all-powerful in this universe. Why is Spider-Man suddenly Iron Man? What is the point of Vision, for someone so powerful he doesn't seem to do much other than whine.I did think Dr. Strange was cooler than his own movie in this film. Tony Stark, always likable. Thor was very enjoyable, and I loved his scenes with the Star Jammers. Peter Parker's humor was funny and I liked him better in this film than Homecoming. The best scenes for me were the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Pretty much everything they do is good. The best comedic line was from the bald Black Panther woman, which, unfortunately they didn't show that much of her. In fact, this was a 2 hr 40 min movie with only 2-3 minutes of screen time for the few female characters they've bothered to add to the film Marvel Universe, who are mostly only in the films to make the guys not look gay. The Scarlett Witch seemed to be one of the most powerful characters yet her few scenes were only dedicated to talking about how much she loves Vision and fawning all over this boring robot guy who doesn't seem to have emotion. Yep, a real attractor for women. Black Widow has been lame from the start. A Shield Agent with no powers whom they've given laser guns to, on the team with a bunch of super powered dudes and a god. Lame. There's a long assortment of Marvel super power females they could have added to Avengers but they literally just added someone to look hot. It really annoyed me how underused all the female characters were in this film. Black Panther's sister was the star of the Black Panther film and she has no purpose in the Avenger film other than to cut out Vision's stone. She's basically an extra.I've never kept much up on Thanos 'cause he's a relatively boring character who wasn't very often used in the Marvel universe for the 10 years I read Marvel comics. I think he was more of a Silver Surfer or Rom villain...which, did anyone actually read those? I thought the idea that balance is used as bad and evil was a bad message. What is he now, an eco-terrorist? He didn't seem so much crazy as a Green Peace dude with too much power. Thanos chose people at random so he wasn't a racist, a bigot, or anything else, he was by the films portrayal an environmentalist. Humans thin out animals when they ravage the terrain. How is it different? I go to films to be entertained, not have these poorly plotted out existentialism by stoners moments. In the past 6 months, Infinity War, Jurassic World, and The Last Jedi all had these nihilist themes or moments where they are trying to express some weak, childish form of morality but it is actually anti-heoric, selfish, immoral, or just lame.I, in some way applaud the writers for making the film mildly entertaining despite the amount of characters they were working with. That is a challenge. But, overall there wasn't much story going on or actual emotion so I really didn't care when they killed off a good chunk of the heroes. All I could think was, ""Oh, his contract is up, so they're killing him off. They didn't use her anyway, so, of course she's dead. Oh, well, he's a new actor every 2 or 3 movies, so, no surprise."" Didn't care. The entire film was fairly unmemorable and my life could have continued just fine without seeing it.","

 I'm not sure if Disney paid people to rate this movie this high or people turn off their brains before watching this or most people prefer destruction and people punching each other over a good storyline. 6/10 because the visuals were stunning.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","jtindahouse","2 May 2018","There are some films that simply can not be reviewed without going into spoilers. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' is one of them, so fair warning. I watch roughly 150 films each year and yet this is the first MCU movie I have seen. Not a single one of them up until now appealed to me. What finally got me along to see this one? Well the fact that it is currently sitting in the top 10 of the IMDb Top 250 had a little to do with it. I had to see what all the fuss was about. There are some truly tremendous and groundbreaking films in that list and the top 10 in particular holds some of the greatest films ever made. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' has no business being there.There are a lot of characters in this movie to keep up with and it is frankly exhausting at times. Admittedly, the film actually does a pretty god job of balancing everyone and giving them sufficient screen time and a purpose for being in the movie. There are so many characters though and so many story arcs that it can become a little frustrating waiting for the good ones to role around again. What I've learnt is that there are some incredibly strong characters in this universe ('Iron Man' was the stand-out for me) and some phenomenally weak characters too ('Captain America' probably being the weakest from what I could ascertain). The strongest thing the movie has going for it is the character of 'Thanos'. A genuinely intimidating, menacing and threatening villain is always the key to any superhero movie being good. Josh Brolin plays him brilliantly (as he always does) and this film owes a lot to that character alone.Now let's get into those spoilers by talking about the ending. Basically 'Thanos' wins and with the click of his fingers kills half the universe. We then see roughly half of the superheroes crumble into nothing and ""die"" (supposedly). I suspect this has a lot to do with the film having such a high IMDb rating. It turns out people love an ending where the bad guys win. That makes me happy, because it doesn't happen anywhere near enough in Hollywood today. My problem with the ending though is this. If you really think those characters are dead, never to be seen again, then you are sorely mistaken. So in that sense it is incredibly cheap. I hate movies (universes) where a character dying doesn't actually mean they're dead (DC is just as guilty of this sadly). As if this isn't obvious enough to 90% of people, the film actually reminds of you of this fact not 5 minutes prior when a character is killed only for 'Thanus' to go back a few moments in time and thus bring him back to life.Enjoy this film for what it is. It's a great looking flick, with some excellent action sequences, funny one-liners and a menacing villain with a clear and simple plot that is easy to follow. It's done well no one could deny that, but don't try and claim that is something truly great and worthy of the IMDb top 10 because that is simply not the case.","

Minutes of pure action, people that were fans, were not fans or think they are fans watched this movie around the whole world, their are groups of characters that fight for the same thing and as the movie goes on, more and more characters group together until there is only pretty much 1 big group of heroes. This movie is unique because the heroes aren't the protagonist, it's kinda the amazing villain Thanos, he is emotionally driven and his story is great, he is kinda a hero, he thinks wiping out half the universe is necessary to safe the universe from problems caused by overpopulation, he knows it is crazy and solving a problem means trying not to hurt anyone but he believes he has to do it! He is constantly getting hammered by the heroes and you kinda feel bad for him, there is no villain. This is why he is a great villain, he is not trying to be a menace out to blow the world, he is trying to do his part and save it.Another thing I love is that anyone can watch it, anyone can enjoy it even do they don't care about marvel, the MCU works in a way that someone only has to watch some movies to understand that there is a connection with these stones, and someone going after all of them is a big deal! The movie is it's own think and is pure fun superhero action, it is great and truly has a infinite amount of fun.The movie is a must watch and is the big event in a way, it is kinda the first part and the second being Avengers Endgame, both movies are their one story at the same time as being a part of this now over a decade long franchise.

Thanos (Josh Brolin) gathers a group of bad guys with the quest of obtaining all the infinity stones. His goal is to save the universe by killing off half of its life with the snap of a finger...and enjoy the sunset. The film combines all the Marvel characters available to do a film to fight the villains and Stan Lee to play a bus driver. The feature assumes you have seen all the other films as there is zero introduction of character, and hopes you have forgotten a few minor details that conflict with the current film. The film is generally darker than previous films, but still has the humor. I wished Star Lord had discovered a new tape whereby he could defeat Thanos. Not thrilled with the plot or ending. The production works with 3 subplots for much of the feature. The ending...well we know what happens next with a go back in time and let's hose this series up like they did X-Men.","

Each stone quest involves 10 minutes or so of the same CGI fighting. Why 5 stones? Why not, they've got time to fill. Lots and lots of time. Many of the characters are likeable esp the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Hulk and Tony Stark BUT, there are just too many groups involved with too much repetition. The plot is mildly interesting daring to touch on overpopulation crisis. Thanos makes a good point. Though in true Hollywood style, he goes about it the wrong way. He should have sterilized half the planet, not dissolve them.","

Sure, non-stop action with all your favorite heroes and foes, yet an overly fast paced plot leaves only the outstanding SFX to remember when you feel cheated by the ending, and knowing you have to wait another year to close-out the mystery. So until then, you have to jump to your own conclusions. Not a fan of these type of plots. Still, exciting and well directed and acted. A generous 9/10 from me.","

And thankfully it didn't. The movie delivered what was expected from it.Full paced action with CGI as a visual spectacle.And the anti climax was a bit of a gamble which paid off perfectly.I would have given it a 9 if not for the unnecessary misplaced humor,which the directors are still refusing to let go.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","l-r-patrick","2 May 2018","Firstly, special effects were really good, cast was also very good! I grew up reading these comics and Thanos along with Doctor Doom were my two favorite bad guys!
Thanos is very good in this film, it's just the writers obviously don't know the comics very, or just think they are better than the likes of Stan Lee and Jim Starlin who
was the person that created Thanos. Thanos kills to please Lady Death, he does not kill just because he thinks there's to many people, what a stupid idea that was.
I mean if he is worried about there not being enough resources for the population, once he has the infinity gauntlet, he can solve that by creating enough resources for
everyone! It would have been so simple to have Thanos worshipping Lady Death, her just silently watching, and him, as in the comics trying to gain her attention by 
killing to please her, but that was to complicated for the writers to put in, as audiences would not know who she was, lol. Self explained by Thanos, easily done, 
we've not seen the dwarf before, but he magically appeared, I mean, that was another waste of a whole sequence, Thor trying to get a hammer made (Beta Ray Bills 
hammer btw), I mean WTF, just have his proper hammer rejuvinate and hold the power, oh yeah, these writers wanted to change that part of the story as well.
These writers need to know, Stan, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko etc etc wrote and created these characters and they should stick to the original elements that made them
what they are today. They think they can come along and rewrite these stories in their vision, just like JJ Abrahams with Star Wars and Star Trek, they think they are
better than the original creators which they are not by any means!For me it's getting to the point where I don't really care if I see these films anymore, they just let me down every time, where these writers don't do the proper research
and just create it in their own way. The comic fans made the comics a success, without us over the years, there would be no films, so maybe you should try to please the
fans before the random cinema goers?Bits that really annoy me, no Lady Death or any celestial power beings of any kind, Red skull appears on the planet galaxies away to Thanos about the sould gem, great writing
there, true to the comics, NOT! Boy that sucked, I thought, why is this not at least Mephisto here or Lady Death, Red Skull, it's so bad I want to cry.
The Hulk was not really in the film, just the first few minutes, they just wanted to give the actor face time, so just had him jumping around in the Hulk buster outfit, yawn!This film is an insult to The Infinity Gauntlet Comics, go and read Thanos Quest, then The Infinity Gauntlet 1-6 and wait for this on normal TV.Totally ruined one of my favorite story lines, these writers need to get over themselves and not write it as if they think it's their creation, it's not!Best bit in the film for me, was Stan Lee's cameo!5/10 but should have been an easy 10.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","milleniumlogan","3 May 2018","This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans. The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. 
Star-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy. Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot. Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene. Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense. Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie. Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth. Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU.","

Its plot is a series of battle set-pieces, in which a cast overstuffed with hero figures engage in pointless fights with an unbeatable enemy. The dialogue is throwaway, the scenes of human interaction brief and trivial, and the moral seems to be ""you can't win"". The ending is particularly offensive, because it violates the prime rule of narrative-- providing the viewer with a sense of closure. At the end (almost) everybody dies and then. . .The End.

But these never-ending franchise add-ons are pretty boring unless you're 12 or a CGI junkie. There's very little evidence of a story behind all of the mind-boggling action, over acted drama, and special effects. It drives me nuts anymore, when fighting takes a 5 minute 'time out' for a lame, ""poignant"" dialog scene. I guess that I've seen too many of these to enjoy them anymore.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","searchingfortao","27 April 2018","I've watched every MCU movie at least twice. I love them all, even Iron Man 2, but this was terribly disappointing. This whole thing gave me the impression that the writers watched a lot of Game of Thrones and thought: ""I know what people like, let's kill a bunch of heroes!"" Even if the fight scenes devolved to the absurd, it didn't matter, we had good guys dying, so this would be a win.Now obviously it's a comic book movie, so it's a safe bet that most if not all of the heros they killed will somehow miraculously be resurrected, but that's not the point. I just paid £12 to watch characters I fell in love with get murdered for 2 hours only to have it wrap up with half of everyone dying. Now I get to wait an entire year to find out how they're going to fix it.If I wanted to get punched in the stomach, I'm sure I could find someone to do it for less than £12 and 2 hours of my time.","

I will not hold on one second and beat on him after you get the glove off, I will do it now!' because darn it, it's too tough to expect us to come up with a good reason they fail."" How about having some of Thanos's followers show up and prevent it? There are so many other problems with the last third, I swear it was written completely separate from the rest.

"Avengers: Infinity War","tfminfl","13 January 2019","303. Avengers: Infinity War. Heres what I get... There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Droid army Vs the Naboo... only now it was Thermos' computer viruses Vs Wakanda... you're sayin that wasn't intentional? Filmbufftim on FB.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheMovieDoctorful","14 November 2018","No matter what people think about me or my opinions, I wanted to like this film more than anyone. I love superheroes, I love Marvel and as much as I criticize the MCU for being safe and formulaic, there are several Marvel Cinematic Universe films that I've loved (The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the first 2 Captain America movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther to name the big ones). And I love that this movie enthralled and captivated many of my friends, a good number of them calling this one of their favorite movies of all time. However, the truth of the matter is that Avengers: Infinity War disappointed me. It deeply let me down. It's not an absolute failure and I certainly wouldn't call it irredeemable, but I can't say I find it to be a good film either.In terms of positives, the first one to come to mind would obviously be the jolly, purple giant himself, Thanos. He's undoubtedly one of the most interesting and developed villains in the MCU to date and he's acted phenomenally by Josh Brolin. I commend the creative team for keeping Thanos utterly despicable and villainous while still making him a compelling enough lead for us to be invested in his dark mirror of the Hero's Journey. It's fascinating to see an arc like this, full of sacrifice, struggle and personal loss concluding in an ultimate triumph, be translated to a villain without losing any of the qualities that keep him monstrous. He is a fully rounded, fully realized, human character; just not one who's a good person.As someone who hated Tom Holland's Spider-Man in both Civil War and Homecoming, I actually liked his performance and characterization here. The high stakes consequences of the story allow Holland to go to emotional places he simply wasn't allowed to before and his relationship with Tony Stark carries much more emotional weight, relatability and humanity to it than either of his previous two films. Maybe there's hope for this Spider-Man after all.Most (Keyword; most) of the content regarding the Guardians of the Galaxy is done wonderfully. Dave Bautista's Drax and Pom Klementieff's Mantis act wonderfully off of all the Avengers they get to interact with and it's nice to see that MCU teamup movies have moved and matured beyond thinking that every teamup movie needs all the team members to hate each other and fight over nonsense for 2 acts. Chris Pratt's performance as Starlord is truly heartbreaking and I commend the team behind Infinity War to have the guts to painfully strip away everything this character ever loved. For all my problems with the film, Starlord's emotional breakdown at Thanos after learning of Gamora's death is actually a major highlight of the movie for me. It's a deeply human and relatable moment that Pratt acts with such intensity and power.I also found myself really invested in the love story of Vision and Wanda. Elizabeth Olsen and Kevin Bettany have beautiful chemistry and their calm, soft moments before the storm bring a real gentleness and quiet beauty to the film. Scarlet Witch being forced to kill the only man she ever loved to save half the universe was by far the most emotionally powered moment of the movie and it's such a shame these two got so little screentime.That's the biggest problem of the film for me. Characters getting little screentime. Infinity War is deeply overstuffed, it has characters by the dozens and no idea what to do with a good half of them. Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Black Panther, the Hulk; all of these characters (As well as the side characters they're associated with) could be completely removed from the film and nothing would change. And yet, I'm supposed to feel the epic weight of their massive battle with the army of Thanos despite their importance to the story being minimal at best and non-existent at worst?The ending felt cheap to me rather than dramatic and emotional. The only deaths to really affect me were Vision and Spider-Man. The rest (Minus Gamora, whose death is too awkwardly edited and weirdly toned down from a violence standpoint to affect me until Starlord's reaction, and Loki, who has been seemingly killed and brought back to life so many times that I hardly buy he's finally dead) die with little to no reaction from their friends and comrades when that's exactly what we needed. We don't get to see Rogers react to losing both of his closest friends or the rest of the Guardians all dying together. It's all such blatant sequel baiting, especially with many of the characters (Including Loki) already having future MCU films or TV shows announced. Gee, I guess they're all just going to center on piles of sand, huh? This kind of sequel baiting conclusion is hardly ""new"" or ""bold"" or ""inventive."" In fact, it's pretty much what the MCU already did with Captain America: Civil War.Speaking of, as much as people want to give Guardians Vol. 2 crap for not balancing the comedy and drama well, where were your criticisms here? Towards a movie that starts making pop culture reference jokes almost immediately after Gamora's death, hardly even giving us a moment of mourning or reflection? A movie that hardly ever gives us a moment for pause for Thor to mourn Loki? I'm sure there was ambition in here somewhere, but in the end, everything got overpowered by the Marvel formula and tone for me.No, Infinity War isn't terrible, but I simply think it bit off more than it could chew. However, everything is set up for Part II to blow me away. I'm still holding out hope for this stage of the MCU to end in a high note for me.","

Apparently this movie is a culmination of all the previous storylines in the Marvel universe, so this time they made sure to _really_ go over the top with it to please the fans. All your favorite characters are there doing their own thing to fight against the main villain in an end game that feels like it's 7 hours long. With so many characters and so many parallel storylines I found it hard to focus or care about anything and just tuned out, like when you're watching a very long battle in a Transformers movie that has no consequences whatsoever and the movie loses you and you start to ask yourself why you're not doing anything useful with your life instead of watching that nonsense.It's probably just me as I'm not really interested in this universe in general and the main villain is kind of disappointing in my opinion, but be warned, if you're not a die hard fan either, you will probably be bored to death just like me.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","s3276169","30 July 2018","The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel. This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh. The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks ""all the same"". On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer. That said this film is what it is. I've seen it all before and I'd be hard pressed to want to see it all again. 5/10 from me.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","haydenluz","13 August 2020","Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","ryfin","8 November 2021","I adore this movie, and it is by far my favorite MCU movie. Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.","

The movie is more of a Thanos story which is fine as we need to know as much about this Titan, however the rest just didn't measure up.I understand getting some 30 characters together in one movie was always going to be a stretch, but I really didn't enjoy the movie. I won't delve into the plot as many reviewers have done so, I will just say that some of the action sequences were pretty good especially from Iron Man and Dr Strange, but ultimately the ending really agitated me and yes, we all know there will be another movie soon to complete this story but it just felt like a setup movie.Not as epic as everyone is making it out to be. I still rather watch the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier and even Ragnarok over this any day.","

The power balance between characters strength and weaknesses seemed flawed. One character would be in peril from X weapon in one scene but then beat a more powerful weapon Y in another scene.

"Avengers: Infinity War","coldembrace619","15 May 2022","Can you imagine a better comic book movie? So much going on from start to finish, and yet the story is well-written, every character is unique and brings extra flavor to the film, and every transition fits perfectly. The Russo Brothers really outdid themselves, I was utterly captivated the entire movie and will probably rewatch IW multiple times without getting bored. This is a treat for comic book fans everywhere. Also, how about Josh Brolin as Thanos? Ridiculously good!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","FabledGentleman","25 April 2018","MAJOR SPOILERS!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!My headline is the easy way to describe this movie. It is grand, majestic and spectacular. Just like Thanos towering everyone else with his physique this movie also stands above everything else, at least most of it. Because wow, this movie is really something to behold. Marvel went all in with everything here, the cgi is phenomenal, the acting is great, the story is well told, the pacing is near perfect. I have seen this movie twice in IMAX 3D and once in 4DX now, and i have never seen a movie with better image quality than this one, never.Ever since the MCU started with Iron Man i have seen every film released, most of them are good, some are outright great, a few are mediocre and very few are bad. But for the most part it has been a hell of a ride, and I've eagerly been awaiting this movie for quite some time, we all knew that it would come down to this, but were you prepared for what would be the outcome? Not many were, though many of us knew several avengers and other major characters would die in this film, i did not expect it to be this many.This movie truly didn't waste any time getting down to business, as before ten minutes had passed, Heimdall and Loki are killed, and we see the Titan kick the crap out of Hulk, this set the tone for the entire movie right of the bat, and was IMO a smart move, now we knew for sure what a badass Thanos is, and this was before he got all the stones.What the Russo brothers have done here is to overdo themselves. Winter Soldier and Civil War are two of the best MCU movies to date, and you got to wonder how Marvel found these guys, and knew what they were capable of, because Infinity War just lifted the bar even higher. This movie is sort of Michael Bay's wet dream, this is what he wants to achieve, but never can because he has no idea how to tell a story or handle emotions. This movie is a 2 hour and 30 minute spectacle, which has action scene after action scene lined up, and it never feels too much, somehow they managed to balance it, and that is a feat not many directors can pull off.But also the music is masterfully composed, and fit every scene perfectly. And the costumes and props design are state of the art, everything looks and feels so right in this film, all the people involved has done an outstanding job.And i really have to give it to Josh Brolin. Thanos is easily the best villain i have seen in quite some time. He is a complex villain, that is so well portrayed i almost start rooting for him, and that is saying something come to think how many years i have grown to love the avengers and the guardians. This is also big thanks to the amazing cgi that just brings so much life into the character. I can understand his motivations, i can side with his thoughts, i both agree and i disagree at same time. Such a great character, easily the best MCU villain so far, and i had Loki as my favorite before him.At the end when Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Scarlett Witch, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Black Panther, Mantis, Bucky Barnes and many others are killed because he gets all the stones, i both felt a sense of pride for Thanos completing his mission, he truly is a determined badass. But at the same time i felt great sadness that so many of the characters that i loved, are dead.But MCU has killed characters before, which has been brought back to life, so i guess that will be the case here as well, as the next movie most likely will deal with time travel and fight Thanos in the future and the past. Dr.Strange gave up the time stone because of the 14.000.605 outcomes that he saw, only one lead to victory for the avengers, and giving up the stone was the beginning of the victory path. So even though this movie ended on a cliffhanger, it left enough hints that will be talked about for a whole year, and it will build the biggest hype in the history of cinema. So at the end of the day, this movie just delivers on so many levels, and it will make way for the rise of many new characters to enter the MCU, and finally take down Thanos and undo some of the damage he has done.It's quite amazing that this movie actually managed to live up to the hype, that should not even be possible when you think about it, but it did. The movie is absolutely amazing.I can't wait for Avengers 4.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","brunovanael","21 January 2019","Jurassic Park, The Sixth Sense, Alien, Harry Potter and The Hangover are great movies. Putting all characters, realities and styles of these movies into one would probably result in a hidious thing, and that's what's wrong with this Avenger movie. There's too much of everything. More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","tommy5677","29 September 2018","That's what you enter the theater with. Especially when you're going to see a Marvel movie. In this case not a single one was met. By the middle of the movie I found myself asking, where is it going and when is it going to get there.Three quarters in I found myself realizing it needed to be over. Every scene became a drag because that's what they did. On and on, one after another, with no endpoint. It was like the writer had a vision and then went blind.A simple plot that was easy to follow but it never seemed to develop. And you would think that in 2 1/2 hours you might get to know your characters a little. There was so much constant action and CGI, there was little or no time for that.If you enjoy being on the edge of your seat the entire time, this movie will do it for you because the action is never ending. A shining example of overdone CGI, lots of violence, and not enough time to tell if anyone can actually act.All of this nonsense to be left in the end with an incredible sense of loss. When I go to a superhero movie I want the superhero to win. In this case, The Avengers are nothing but a bunch of losers. And then there was the End Credits. They were giving credit to employees of the studios, like the CEO of Disney. WTF! This went on ad nauseum just like the movie itself. Don't waste your time waiting for the scene at the end, you'd be better off leaving the theater before the credits start to roll. 
In my opinion, this movie is an abysmal failure. Don't waste your 13 bucks on such trash.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","warren-87235","20 September 2018","Having missed this at the cinema, my other half and I finally got round to buying and watching it (in 3D). Wow... what a mess. I'm glad we didn't pay to see this at the cinema. I'm quite honestly amazed at how many good reviews it's been getting. It's disturbingly close to 'Last Jedi' level bad (but not quite... that would still take some work). There's no real plot to speak of, things just seem to happen 'because', any sense of logic or consistency goes out the window (And that's in comparison to most of the other Marvel movies, which are hardly that great in the logic stakes in the first place!), power levels constantly change to fit a particular scene, rather than match what has been established for characters previously, etc., etc..... To top it all off, after all the build up, Thanos turns out to be one of the least interesting Marvel villains, with face-palm-inducing 'woke' motivation. The only good thing I'll say, is that it manages what most Marvel movies usually manage: the character interaction and banter is fun for the most part, and amusing. Oh, and most of the effects are good (except for Banner pointlessly in the Hulk-buster).I understand and applaud the desire to try an 'Empire Strikes Back', but there are a few big differences (A story, for one). Empire works so well because our heroes get their posteriors kicked. They struggle tooth and nail to survive, and even when they do get a chance to fight they are soundly defeated. Infinity War falls flat, because the villain and his forces never feel particularly strong, and our heroes get repeated opportunities to defeat Thanos and simply don't take them because it would end the film early.To be honest, despite its very obvious flaws (and a certain top lip deserving second billing), I actually found Justice League more enjoyable. I genuinely began falling asleep at the end of Inifinity War and closed my eyes, just listening till the end, I was so bored. Such a shame and a wasted opportunity after the build up of so many movies.","

The ending is surprising, especially for an American movie, but besides this the movie neither offers scenography comparable with Star Wars or Avatar nor any unique special effects.There is no consistency in action, power distribution or whatsoever. One minute the same character can die from a fist hit, the other he survives an explosion of the whole planet. Once he travels the space barefoot, the other he dies from being sucked from the ship. The colorful light goes back and forth but the evil character doesnt use any of his powers most of the time just to prolong the boring fights.Watching this movie is just distubring and frustrating.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","tyrantlizardthad","19 August 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film so powerful and good that instead of being crushed by the weight of its expectations, it lifted them up and launched them out into space. Packed with epic, intense action, fantastic character work, and a powerful ending, it doesn't get much better then this. It's especially remarkable when you remember just how much buildup there was to this film and how massive the expectations were, you would think it would be almost impossible to meet, but Infinity War does it so well it makes it look easy.The story is exhilarating, it moves at a brisk pace which really makes you feel the immense stakes and how urgent the situation is. Every single character is handled extremely well and are all in character. The film makes sure to pay attention to what spot they're in in their character journey since the last film each respective character was in and continues their development. It maintains continuity and brings every character together in a way that's organic and serves the story perfectly. Tony Stark finally gets to fight the thing he has been tormented by and preparing for years to fight, Steve Rogers and most of the other Avengers are fugitives of the law and thus are more rugged, Bruce Banner is still dealing with his conflict with the Hulk (continuing what was established Thor: Ragnarok), Thor is dealing with the grief of losing everything, manifesting in personal vengeance towards Thanos, and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the characterization of Thanos, one of the best villains in cinema since Darth Vader from Star Wars (which was the intent of the Russos, specifically saying that the wanted to make ""the next Darth Vader""). He is a ruthless, insane and narcissistic monster, but he still has honorable traits, respects his enemies, he has a very flawed perspective of how to save the universe but believes it whole-heartedly, and even a fatherly love towards Gamora. He's terrifying but also humanized, and it just works perfectly.The computer generated effects, especially those that brought Thanos to life, are perfect, as is the soundtrack. While MCU scores are typically regarded as forgettable, Alan Silvestri's score for Infinity War is anything but. The performances are impeccable as well, there's not a single unsatisfying or uneven performance. Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Benedict Bumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Zoe Salanda as Gamora in particular stick out to me and knock it out of the park.In conclusion, Infinity War is the best MCU film and one of the best films to have come out in the past 10 years, and I don't think you could ask for more. Infinity War (along with its sequel, Avengers: Endgame) isn't just a movie, it's an experience.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","pal05052003","29 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War manages to fix and upgrade superhero movies on many levels. First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","pink_floydilia","10 February 2019","So to preface this review, let me start by saying I'm a massive Marvel fan. I've lived, breathed, written and read Marvel since I was eight years old.
The Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie. And to the masses, it was good. So hats off to them for making a crowd pleasing movie. But to the others who like some sense and substance when they pay good money to see a movie, try harder.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Mr-Fusion","29 April 2018","High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, ""Infinity War"" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color. But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result. If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly. I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction. And that's about it.6/10","

"Avengers: Infinity War","comolgab","12 January 2019","Superheros are super because they do amazing things compared to the rest of us in this world. Here however, everyone does amazing things, always, for too long. It becomes boring. There is no normal world in the background to provide the contrast, it is one (long) fantasy tale. They're all ""super"" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still ""clunky"" and ""solid"". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character. Of course the movie is visually striking, but again, from the first scene to the last: I got used to the visuals after about 20 minutes, the rest felt to me like repetition.","

If you love these characters, were hooked on the previous movies, *don't.*

This movie is not like the others, and honestly, does not show much screen time for most the characters.
It is much more violent and emotional than the previous films, but more than that, it is extremely disturbing.
Basically, if you feel obligated to view it for your favorite characters, just beware, there's not much screen time for them, so don't push yourself, or feel like you have to do it.
Also, I would definitely NOT take kids to see this, as the movie has a very dark and disturbing atmosphere to it.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","olgavalentovaov","30 April 2018","This movie has certainly made history. A film that has so much going on and still manages to be boring just has to be some sort of a record. I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there).
Also, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot.
And to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay. We don't need another character up in here, we really don't. And especially not Carl Manvers.
Not worth the cash, not worth the hype, not worth another word.","

Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some ""plot holes"" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers","

"Avengers: Infinity War","bogdanrc","27 April 2018","Awesome visuals and CGI, but this is not 1990s. Terminator 2 was awesome back then. Now CGI just does not impress anymore. That's Michael Bay territory, and this movie sure looks like that - awesome CGI and dumb plot.Character and plot wise, I just want to say that I am sick of heroes and villains having their abilities appear or vanish from one scene to another just to justify the plot. Not to talk about stupid character decisions that completely change the plot...It takes away from the soul of the story which becomes simple, forced and artificial.SPOILER:Just one example for abilities (but the movie is full of it): in one scene Thanos beats the pulp out of Hulk, but in the rest of the movie all the other heroes receive punches from him like it's nothing.And one example of stupidity: Quill becomes responsible for the grim ending by saving Thanos in the last second, as Thanos was on the verge of being stripped of its powers.I expected more...","

"Avengers: Infinity War","tzarr0","14 July 2018","Well ... the only movies i really enjoyed from this Marvel Universe ... are GotG 1,2 and Thor - Dark World and Ragnarok ... especially because are not Earth based, and explore other cultures and civilizations. This one butchered both ... storylines and character groups, with a really childish story follow-up and characters' motivations, an overpowered uni-dimensional antagonist with a relentless and simplistic goal (i guess this is specific to comic-books ... but i hoped the franchise had outgrown those ... and will try a little more depth), way too many action scenes with a known outcome ... no twist, no upset ... nothing to look remotely interesting and to remember about the plot. A bleak ending, with many random and meaningless ... 'deaths' ... which are not even close to be emotional ... because of the random factor ... and because they won't be probably permanent ... which bring us to ... ending with ... major cliffhanger ... which is a very ... poor writing choice for a movie. The only way you watch a movie ... is because it offers you ... a sufficient sense of closure and explanation ... at the end ... otherwise ... you watch a tv series ... because these story is much more long-winded, complex and characters are much more ... in-depth. In conclusion ... this has to be one of the worst ... titles in the entire franchise ... when i was expecting ... a deluxe / combo.

"Avengers: Infinity War","oliverdimitri","26 April 2018","Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","nicar127","13 May 2018","Kill kill kill. Death. That's what this movie is about. To their credit, the actors in this film were all great, despite each being given minimal screen time, with near zero character development. There are just too many characters and angles, each with the same ultimatum: KILL. (They are all trying to kill the villain Thanos, of course, but it's still Kill Kill Kill!)I never felt any passion for any of them until Gamora was thrown to her death by her POS step dad Thanos. When we see movies we want to feel the passion of the characters we are watching. None existed until this moment. My favorite character in this film is Peter Quill. Way to go Chris Pratt. He brought depth and passion, sorrow and love, to his role. He is the stand out in this film. I cried when he cried. I was pissed off when he was pissed off. Peter Quill / Star Lord was the sole representative of human emotion in this film. And he did it well.On the technical note, Thanos just looks like a cartoon character.
(No offense, Josh Brolin, you were GREAT as Thanos!!)
CGI always looks fake. I watched the entire movie imagining the ""green screen"" behind all of them. In a few years, actors won't be needed at all.Iron Man could have just gotten a huge eraser to erase Thanos The Cartoon.
Have a great summer!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","dezsokekovacs","28 April 2018","If you like to watch for 2.5 hours how your heroes get beaten and even killed then this movie is for you, otherwise it will not entertain you. 
At the beginning Thanos has only one Infinity Stone but at the end he has all the stones and therefore he snap his fingers, half of the population dies (Avengers included) and ... THE END!
This means that there are 5 fights for the 5 stones and Thanos wins all the fights by beating and/or killing the Avengers.All MCU movies structures are the same. They are split in 2 parts: in the first half the heroes get beaten and the villain wins all, but when all hope is gone it start the second half when the heroes recover from their wounds and they win (almost every time) with a big ""idiotic"" bam.
The Avengers: Infinity War is the first half. I think it will be entertaining to watch it when the Avengers 4 will come out (just like The fellowship of the ring + The two tower). It's very likely that in Avengers 4 they will use the time stone to reverse the time to resurrect the dead Avengers. Or maybe another stone (honestly I don't really know what they can do) but the resurrection is for sure.Bottom line: this movie is watchable if you see it only once. But to watch several times how your heroes get killed means that you need therapy.PS: When Dr. Strange looked into the future to find a positive solution, he found only ONE from millions of possibilities and they didn't used it. Why? Or they used it but Strange didn't saw in the future that Peter Quill is coming?","

Don't get me wrong, originality alone does not make a good story. This movie continues to try squeeze water from a rock and I leave wanting so much more. The movie was much too long and especially the fight scenes. As in the old Wendy's commercial, ""Where is the beef?"", or in my case a good story and characters I care about.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","adeckofcards","25 July 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.
In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.
It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.
'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","

All that we get - is a portion of idiotic choices just to excuse the upcoming ""ACTION"". Ye, baby, gimme more... These sweet fireworks and a talking piece of purple CGI is all I need. These ""Avengers"" might be mentally disabled: can't think OR use abilities OR communicate with each other.

I felt really bad when yondu died in GOTG 2 but in this film never felt anything for anyone. So many died but i don't know why this film was in a rush and that's why their death didn't made me feel bad for them. They should have increased the runtime of the film. One of the worst thing is characters were not balanced. Captain america hardly had any dialogue. Hulk was shown only for 30 seconds in the entire film. There were many ways to stop thanos but hey he should look badass so let's make heroes dumb. Cgi was okay but in many places it looked cartoon-ish. In one scene it looked like Mark ruffalo's face is pasted on hulk buster. The film is full of plot holes.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Shakor77","18 July 2018","To a certain degree most super hero movies are pointless as they are mainly about beings with super powers and in flamboyant costumes duking it out at each other. And, seeing as I grew up reading super-hero comics, that is just fine.However, without getting into any spoilers, this movie could have ended the first minute as the end-result would have been the same as watching the whole thing for 2+ hours. So I guess you could say that this game was a setup for the next Avengers movie, which seems to have become the norm these days.But disregarding that, there are a number of other weak points in this movie such as:Hulk was a massive disappointment and made his weakest contribution so far of any Avengers movie. And it was never explained why.Vision was another disappointment as apparently the Black Widow, who has no super powers, could hold her own against someone who was mopping the floor with Vision.Some young girl in Wakanda, who I never heard of in the comics, is apparently more intelligent than both Bruce Banner and Tony Stark as she came up with a solution, in about 5 minutes after been presented with the problem, that those other two hyper-intelligent people could not come up with. I suppose that is because of feminism?Loki made a very uncharacteristic choice which quickly made him irrelevant in this movie. Why then even have him in the movie to begin with?Dr Strange, who was pretty good in the movie, didn't seem to stand much of a chance against a Thanos henchman but apparently could go toe to toe with Thanos himself?Thor was easily swept aside by Thanos, in the beginning, yet by the end seemed to be the only one who could actually defeat Thanos, just because he had a weapon. Yet in Thor: Ragnarok Odin suggested that Thor, was more powerful than Odin and did not need any weapons as he said: Are you Thor: son of Hammers? I could go on and on but this is basically a very nice action movie with some great performances from actors such as Josh Brolin as Thanos. But don't think too deeply about it as it is just an action movie and not much more.","

People have just have just made up their minds that it's avengers so it must be a very good movie. The pervious avengers movie were better than this one. In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","three_dead_crows","5 May 2018","In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. 
 
The day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel. After watching this movie I feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure Peter Quill is, just like they did with Danny Rand in the defenders.","

So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama!

BUT the idiocy of believing there are a handful of little stones that control the ENTIRE UNIVERSE? All the neat outer space scenes and strange alien landscapes all of that.BUT to say he would be able to control the ENTIRE Universe?I am sorry but that is beyond ridiculous.I am huge Marvel fan and can actually say I have been reading Marvel since FF#4. And at one time had almost every single issue of the comics they put out until the mid 70s. They were great fun.This movie on the other hand is silly. One person with a handful of stones controls the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.Do the writers at Marvel et al have any clue as to the size of the universe and that is just what we have been able to see? The bazillions and gazillions of GALAXIES, the number of planets would be a ONE followed by millions of zeros. The amount of beings, and all sorts of life forms would be a One followed by a number of zeros so large it is unfathomable.I would have bought say, the galaxy. But this stupidity of the entire universe was just that.Seriously lame. Silly and beyond any sense of rational thought. YES it is comics and just a movie but the primary belief in how to enjoy a movie is the SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Sorry, NO. And on top of that it all centered around a small planet in one of the arms of the Milky Way closer to the edge of the end of the arm than otherwise. Really? HOW did we get so lucky in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.We are supposed to believe the Thanos character would have the ability to wipe out half of that? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAI love Marvel but this should have been an insult to anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together. Oh well I hope we don't get a conclusion that reminds me of an old Saturday Morning serial of Jungle Jim where at the end of the episode where we had to come back next Saturday to that theater to find out how he got out of the predicament of being caught in a HOLE half way done and below him were lions ready to tear him apart and above him were natives ready to rip him apart and cook him.So how did he get out of it? Well Next Saturday's episode started with the voice over stating: ""After Jungle Jim got out of his last trap he headed towards the nearest village"" Seriously that is how they did it.So are we going to get either this was an alternate universe?
A dream that when one of them gets out of the shower his wife says I had the strangest dream?
Or .....? ""Thanos you bad boy, Where have you been? Your father and I have been looking all over dozens of universes. Now you put things right or you are going to get such a paddling when we get back to home!""Thanos: ""Aw gee mom you never let me have any fun""This will be the only interesting part is what silliness they use to restore the universe to its natural order minus some nutjob like Thanos.Gods above and below that was an awful movie but it was cool to see all the Superheroes in one movie.. So glad I could watch it at home and fast forward through all the fighting.BUT ya gotta hand it to the fanboys who have posted it was the greatest cinematic effort in the history of the world. And the one guy who said anyone who says differently then IMDB should immediately pull the review and probably publicly flog the person who wrote it.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","myema77","17 May 2018","Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates.
Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find?
You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered:
Slick action and stunning visuals.
The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here. Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond.With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie.
The story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing.
(The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner)
The supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe.
 On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn.
Thano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing! Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life.As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this. Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie?
Opinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie.Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme.2 stars, one for Tom Holland and the other for Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Lewis_Heather787","28 April 2018","What did I just watch???? To be honest I don't think I can process everything and I'm not such if that is a bad thing or a good thing. To get it out there straight away I'm not a die hard fan of these films actually if anything I've losing more and more interest in the MCU as its gone on. I'm not quite sure why, just a lot of them are not for me but I can see why general audience love them, they are vey appealing. Positives.The Russo brothers were given an almost impossible task and that was to bring together a huge amount of characters in one film and tell a cohesive story that works. For the most part I think they have achieved that, the directing of the film is faultless and is a real achievement considering the number of things that could go wrong with a film like this. Personally though I would put it behind ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"" for the Russo's , those films have less problems than this one.The cast for the most part is good, I cant mention them all because there are so many however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly and I'm really shocked to be saying this, the best character in the film for me is Doctor Strange. Now I personally didn't like the character in he is own film, but thats another story, in this film he is the heart and plays an important role. Acting from Cumberbatch is obviously going to be great, but I was blown away by how good he really was. There is a fantastic fight scene between him and Thanos on his own, wow. The other standout is Thor, Hemsworth again knocks it out of the park and has really cool scenes towards the end of the film which are worth the wait. The others are all really good as well for the most part, but those two definitely stood above the rest. NegativesThis is where this review gets a unhelpful mark because it goes against the consensus of this film. For me there are four main negatives film the film, ok bare with me. Firstly its the same old same old problem I personally have with the MCU and that is the dreaded humour. Extremely cringeworthy at times and once again far to much of it especially with the Guardians, which also really don't like. I know Im in the minority on this, and I have no problem in people thinking this is the best part of the film its just not for me. 
The humour of the film links to the next negative and that is the tone of the film, which to say the least is all over the place. One second we have cringeworthy jokes and the next second its all trying to be serious. I think the Russo's really struggled with this element of the film because the humour and jokes undermine the seriousness. Do one or the other??
The third negative is the end which is a complete joke right? The end was looking at first glance to be a fantastic emotional punch and shocking end to some characters. However instead they decide to ""kill"" off characters that we pretty much know for the most part will be back for the next Avengers film next year. Marvel have already announced sequels and other solo films for characters like Black Panther, Spiderman and maybe even Doctor Strange. So their deaths are meaningless and carry no weight, brings up the question what is the point in the whole film really when we know a reasonable amount of it is going to be reversed in the next film.(I could be wrong)
The final small negative is the length of the film which is far too long, the film does definitely drag in some parts.Overall the film is probably just about good enough for 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, when the film is good it is very enjoyable and good to watch however I have my reservations. They are mainly my own fault and I'm definitely in the minority when it comes to them. However I'm wondering whether even the most die hard fan is not a little disappointed with this film like hasn't this been 10 years in the making. Finally if you like these types of films you will absolutely love it however if your not to bothered like me then you might not enjoy it as much.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Vartiainen","21 June 2018","Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something.So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring.The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more.Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending... We will be talking about that ending for decades to come.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","CubsandCulture","12 December 2018","Everything about this movie was portrayed as bigger and more. Bigger Action! More heroes! The problem with that eventually more becomes less and the story collapses under its own weight. That happens here but not as much as I expected. The final film is coherent so there's that. It is also largely fun. There's that too. However, there is still too many sequence of the same stuff (get the stone!) and a lot of the film is very unwilling to play with the world it has set-up. Of note Dr. Strange and Thanos (post reality stone especially) are far too punchy. You can change the fabric of reality. Why do you insist on just punching people?A film like this lives, or this case disappoints on its villain. Thanos is OK as a villain. He is played well by Brolin. How he is written leaves much to be desired. His radical environmentalism simply doesn't connect with anything that is actually happening in the world today. It makes the film feel insular and escapist in the wrong way. Moreover, the logic of the character requires him to be either a eugenicist or a ""eat the rich"" radical; the screenplay does neither. The writers try to split the different by applying the big moment randomly. (but somehow random means 1/2 of each significant couple among the heroes). It simply doesn't work. It is not chilling. It is not human. It is silly.The deaths (""deaths"") are overdone. I simply do not believe Disney is going kill off a bunch of Golden Geese. It simply doesn't have any emotional weight because too many characters that have sequels in the works ""die."" The ending only gets a hearty chuckle from me.This film is fun. It moves and most of the action is good. But it is shallow, hollow and expects us to forget how capitalism works.","

The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is.
Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie.

Love these types of movies, like I said, I'm a comic book geek.The scenes were outstanding, Thanos fighting all of the Avengers and then some who wasn't Avengers joined in to beat this evil foe. I just hated in how it ended the death of Tony Stark (aka Iron Man). Now for me, I wasn't much of a Robert Downey Jr. Up until his role as Iron Man, loved the way he brought some intelligence to the role of Tony Stark as well as humor to. I just hated that they had to kill him off.Maybe Dr. Strange can go back to that moment and change the coarse of history and still keep the ending the same, by allowing Tony Stark to live but still killing off Thanos...hmm, interesting concept, HEY MARVEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","10 June 2018","I know I'm extremely late to the party, but I waited for a time to sync up and see it with a friend (we both have too many obligations in the education realm), plus I had to see Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok beforehand.Now before I leave any impressions, know that my experience was dampened by students with a moronic goal of sabotage by deciding to blurt out anything about the film they knew that I wouldn't want to know. I mean... what can I do to them in retaliation? Fail them? Strike them down with the hammer of Thor? Nothing, they're untouchable and they know it. It's sad, and I thought I've taught them to be better than that. Unfortunately, that select few is out there and always will be. I've waited nearly thirty years of my life for a film of this impactful magnitude to come out in its respectful genre, and individuals half of my age decide to play the card of indecency upon me and essentially impede on the level of my viewing experience.All that being said... it was a very good film, even better than I liked it (the problem was the spoilers). In fact, if I were to list negatives for this film, it would really just be all in one lump-sum bullet point regarding the lack of grounded material: a lot of space related stuff, nanotechnology (and I really don't like the Iron Spider compared to regular ol' Spider-Man), whims of inexplicable magic sources, levels of seemingly unbeatable friends and foes where I don't understand the devastation of a punch or explosion onto the individual taking the blow, and the recurring MCU element of death not necessarily being a finality for characters' ends.Conversely, there were many things that I really appreciated about the film. The first thing I would like to mention was the balance of everything, starting with the balance of characters and their moments. I thought this was going to be a massive issue going into this film, where it would just be one endless action battle and people wouldn't be able to serve their parts correctly, or they would only serve aspects as a moment of convenience to further the plot. Instead, where everyone was at during any moment seemed very natural to the overall MCU progression of items, and interactions that were had (on top of some that have yet to occur, lying in wait for the fourth Avengers film) were nicely played out. Villain encounters even appeared late in the film, which is kind of nice so that the legend looms larger as the movie goes on instead of playing beats such as: ""We need three fights between hero and villain, so let's spread them out."" Even characters who are physically inferior weren't just suitably matched up with other characters of that nature, and instead they found a way to possibly hold their own or team up to make things equal enough so that the fights could be anywhere with anyone. None of this works just in script alone; this was done by the hands of great directing. The Russo Bros have found a way to serve this great kind of balance for two straight films, though in Civil War it really felt a little more like: ""Let's force the issue and get everyone on screen at once, even in a bit of a friendlier brawl."" Admittedly some characters miss the boat of even appearing in the film, but it was few and far between, and they are explained away where frankly it worked just fine.Another great form of balance was in the light versus dark emotional moments. I have been on Marvel for having too many lighthearted moments in their films, or really too much levity for the sake of entertaining the crowd on their first viewing of a film. They really pushed the envelope with Thor: Ragnarok, and honestly I was not appreciative of it. They needed to find a way to strike the right balance of when to say what and what surface level of comedy they need to inject during the characters given the moments, but most importantly every light moment needs to be balanced with a dark moment for emotions to hit the right heartstrings. Infinity War does exactly that. I wasn't eye-rolling when they injected humor, and only one or two comedic bits were out of place for the moment they were in. That is a fair price to pay for the overall structure. They had enough characters to find those moments with in the 160-minute running time, and for once they didn't have the villain(s) either be demoted to that same level of yuck-yucks nor did they subject them to another character's comedic relief as a way to actually victimize them.This is a great time to transition to this film's villain: Thanos. I have had my quips with MCU villains being rather underserved in scope compared to that of the larger picture at play, like where they may be more of a pawn so the rest of the chessboard could do its thing. Thanos, however, appears as the king of this universe's chessboard. He was the main character in this film, and probably had the most screen time. He was not just a villain seeking ultimate domination of everything for the sake of it, he has his own goals and purposes in an attempt to restore a harmonious balance (there is that world again) for all species. It was not only believable, but it was also sympathetic. He shows remorse for his (attempted) actions, he shows mercy to those who beg for it so long as they aid in furthering his cause, and he speaks with a level head in a way that if we haven't already had eighteen other MCU films liking our heroes so much that we would actually root for the bad guy here. Definitely the best served comic book villain in a decade, if not right alongside the Joker for 'overall' status. Granted, Heath Ledger has given us the performance of a lifetime, though that character is very one-dimensional (and really good at that dimension, no doubt). Thanos really surprised me that he was more than just a large purple alien wanting ""MOAR.""I want to give the directors credit for making an extremely long running time feel extremely short. I don't know if I'm sitting here saying that I'd like to watch a whole 'nother hour of the film, but they hit the right beats and paced it so evenly that they really made time fly by in a manner that other films really can't speak for in the same vein. For all the movies I own on Blu-ray, I sometimes stop short of watching something that runs this long because I tell myself: ""This is a long film man, you are going to be devoting a lot of time to this."" I don't think I'll be saying that about Infinity War. If I were to show this to a friend who hadn't seen it yet, I wouldn't be warning them about the duration of it nor would I fear they would be looking at their watch every fifteen minutes wondering when it would end. The more you get into the film, the more you lean forward on the edge of your seat. Yes, sometimes they do cut away from characters to get to others because they have to, but you never forget your place where others are at and you aren't dismayed at the next grouping's story line. It all worked so very, very well.I'll cap this off with one thing that wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be, and it was in the movie's action. There was nothing wrong with it, but outside of some last-act battles I wasn't ever really wowed by anything either. All visual effects were top-notch, though (ehem, Ragarok was not good here too). I do think I'm putting this on a relative scale though, because it's interesting that I say that looking back at the whole picture that I think the moments outside of the action were actually better than the action points themselves, not in terms of entertainment but just in overall value. That's a good thing too, so now you're not just sitting around waiting to be getting your money's worth again. This jumps back to how the film's length is not a concern. No action scene overstays its welcome either, or it has enough dynamic elements and cross-cutting that it fits properly (again, jumping back to Civil War, that airport scene was just way too contrived... this doesn't have that). Age of Ultron was much more of a popcorn flick for me that I really do enjoy, and The Avengers has all of its lasting appeal in the final third of the film when they all assemble together, so I think I can say this one is the most consistently put together.Overall, I would say that my experience was definitely a great one and it is likely hitting inside my Top 3 of all the MCU films (The Winter Soldier still wins). I'm not ready to officially rank it just yet and I still have a lot of questions about what I saw in this one, but again that's a good thing about this film's natural depth where I'll have to watch it more than once to understand and appreciate those items. I really think the thing that brings this movie down a notch was my experience because of spoilers beforehand, and I didn't want to believe many of them to be true but unfortunately many were. This is a movie that I even avoided watching trailers for. Any knowledge about an event I am already interested in does not help ramp up the hype by me learning more about it. Shame on them for doing that to my theatrical viewing, but thankfully this film did not only rely on its spoiler-bound moments to be as good as it was. It was very ambitious, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next because I really have no idea where they want to go from here.","

There is so many marvel characters now that some are just not that great and they shouldn't exist. Black panther is a yawn, and same with the second iron man (pure stupid, along with a 3rd in Banner? Are you kidding me right now?) and new younger spiderboy (even more dumb), which I feel shouldn't be in this series. Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful. I really think they are headed for clash with like Galactus and other bigger enemies and when Fox is bought out by Disney it will lead to the Xmen joining too, gets bigger and worse. Good luck.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","highmarksreviews","29 April 2018","""Avengers"": Infinity War"" is an epic unlike any other. It's a reminder of how far the MCU has come in 10 years and this movie capitalises on its bloated, but beloved cast to draw you in. Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Pjtaylor-96-138044","29 April 2018","'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10","

"Avengers: Infinity War","danjstanley","6 May 2018","I don't typically write reviews; however, someone needed to balance out the over the top love for this bad plotted film with way too many stars. For me, it all comes down to this question:
""Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?"" The answer is NO! 
I know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. 
Then, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","AdrenalinDragon","26 April 2018","I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too.I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to 
focus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it. The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations.9.5/10","

It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. 
There's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. 
Too much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other.
Wakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now.
Anyhow, there are some good parts in the movie, but it's rushed and just awful. I preferred Justice League as a movie; the pacing was a lot better.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Lord_of_the_Things","29 June 2020","I understand why Marvel fans like this movie, but I wasn't impressed.From first scene to last it is just bang, bang, crash, smash, bang! The story is very weak and there is zero character development. Maybe the characters were already fully developed over the previous 30+ movies and hence why so little attention given here.I'm just not invested in the series and so don't find the Avengers movies to be much of a pay off, but get why others do. Personally, I found it to be an exhausting, unrewarding experience.I still gave it 7/10 for its appeal to the fans, but possibly 5 or 6/10 for myself.Recommended for the fans, not anyone else","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Floated2","12 March 2019","Avengers: Infinity War has become a massive box office success and occasional worldwide phenomenon. Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous.Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Overall Infinity War does offer much different occurrences, a lot if characters and a lot going on.Though one can't help feel that it wasn't as great as advertised. Perhaps a second viewing is needed down the line.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Film_star","27 April 2018","I have rated this 5 stars, predominantly because I think 9s and 10s should be provinces reserved for truly great movies. This is an entertaining one, which kept me interested for most of its overlong running time, but which won't leave me with much lingering sense of a tangible movie - it felt like a solid episode in a series I'm binge-watching, but I'll struggle to treasure many specifics of this movie from a line-up of Marvel titles.There are a ridiculous number of characters in this; the film is using that as its ""event"" selling point, but in truth it was the factor which made me most apprehensive before watching it. To the filmmakers' credit, the juggling of storylines and superheroes (and their endless sidekicks and sub-teams) was almost impressive - it never felt as though many were shoehorned too awkwardly into the forward trajectory of the overall narrative, though some characters - including leading players like Spider-Man and Black Widow - inevitably get shortchanged.The series' most rewatchable movies - for me Avengers, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Ragnarok and Black Panther - all have something compelling that feels unique to them. I'm not sure this has a unique selling point beyond a huge cast jostling for billing position on the poster, but whilst it plods along it's perfectly decent, and fans of the franchise will likely lap it up.At the time of writing, the film is ranked number 10 on the IMDb list of the Top 250 movies OF ALL TIME. I'm certain it will plummet once the general public start to supersede the fanboy rush, but this kind of kneejerk over-ranking in the context of cinematic history is a nonsense.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","austin0731","25 April 2018","Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody.Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment.Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable. But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","namashi_1","29 April 2018","The sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 'Avengers: Infinity War', which assembles almost ALL of its Superheroes in one single film, is the biggest Marvel Blockbuster to date. Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story. 'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course!But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc.That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure!Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch! Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts.On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","coreyjdenford","26 April 2018","This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free***** (5/5)IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock. Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron ""I'll do it myself"" and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin. How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage. Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them?Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait. VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","frank_kneepkens","3 August 2018","Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that ""I don't understand"" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!","

Ten years of building, leading to this MASTERPIECE!I guess you want to know something about Thanos. Well, he is the ultimate villain, I mean he is menacing. Every speech that he got, gives you chills, his movements, his motivation, hands down the best villain!The interactions between the different fractions of heroes is magnificent. The first time you see Guardians and Thor, Iron Man and Guardians, Strange and Spidey it's just awesome! The chemistry between them is incredible.The story is told incredibly. The waiting for this movie, the hype, everything is worth it. Actions scenes especially some....are jaw dropping, you gonna shake your head and you will be not able to stay on your seat calm. The music combined with the scenes, like I said MASTERPIECE...this movie is out of this world.Russo Brothers just strike again! The visuals are so well done too. There is no way to catch every single detail on the first viewing, also the movie deserves multiple viewings again and again and again...and I'm not even joking.On purpose I do not want to give you absolute any spoilers.

"Avengers: Infinity War","jhalcollege","3 June 2018","In linear algebra, a matrix is said to be rank deficient if one of its rows or columns can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows or columns. In layman's terms, this particular part adds nothing new to the overall picture, it just uses information that is already present.This happens to be the defining characteristic of Infinity War, there's nothing new here. What there is is a lot of action, a lot of CGI, and lots of bad jokes with a few okay ones tossed in the mix (exactly what Marvel has been doing for ten years).The film makes a half decent effort to distinguish arch-villian Thanos from the rest of the baddies, and its kind of succeeds on a minimal level. But in the end, he's just another world conquering fiend who's bigger and stronger than everyone else (Steppenwolf from Justice League?) who is set off to collect some arbitrary artifacts.Another issue is comes as a side effect of putting so many established characters in. Take Captain American for example, a character whose driven by morals, and whose films are relatively serious, and the Guardians of the Galaxy (about as serious as Looney Tunes). They've done fine on their own, but put them in the same scene and it just doesn't work. At this point, if you're not sick and tired of Avenger's Universe, then good for you. But for the rest of us, one thing's for sure, haters are definitely going to hate this one.(If you're not familiar with the IMDb rating formula, you should check it out. While Infinity War rests at an 8.8 at the time of this writing, it will drop reasonably over time as more casual viewers watch the film, and rate it the four or five it deserves.)","

His character is what we in the gaming world would call OP (Over Powered). How does destroying 50% of all life in the universe bring balance? The whole blasted plot was based on that silly premise! I am pretty sure I need to blame some obscure writers at Marvel for this ridiculous plot and character. The entire movie makes a mockery of science and even science fiction. Spoiler: The idea that you could collect 6 stones (which were created during the Big bang) and then snap your fingers to wipe out 1/2 of all life EVERYWHERE in the known (and probably unknown as well) universe takes witchcraft, sorcery and the supernatural to levels beyond anything within reason. Now where do you go Disney? You gave us a worst case scenario and any future villains will be mild by comparison. As with Thor Ragnarok you destroyed a future where Marvel has skipped over many villians and leapfrogged to the top, leaving a barren wasteland for future enemies to ""marvel"" at.","

In less than a minute he knocks Hulk out! ""We have a Hulk"" is so meaningless right now. Then Banner is forced into and kept in an iron man suit. Agrhhhh! Thanos is so hyped that he shouldn't be beaten even in part 5. How is it that Dr Strange never used the time stone? Then Iron Man and Spiderman (humans) are able to breathe freely on Titan?Also annoying, Vision is carried about like a baby, limp and powerless. You just wonder whether it's the same vision that was so powerful in Civil War and could walk through walls. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting the Avengers to win Thanos in this part since it's a 2-part movie but let's put it this way; the avengers were humiliated!

"Avengers: Infinity War","classicsoncall","5 September 2018","Compared to the first two Avengers movies, I've rated this one a solid '9' against a pair of '7's' for the other two. The prequels felt more like getting the most out of all the destruction that the super-heroes could inflict on their cosmic adversaries. That formula's still at work here but it seemed a lot fresher with the team-up between The Guardians and The Avengers, while Thanos (Josh Brolin) brought a decidedly different dimension to his role as an intergalactic enforcer. Some might even call his mission honorable, in as much as he wants to save the universe with his philosophy that ""If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist"". Fresh on the heels of ""Thor:Ragnarok"", the Marvel and Disney folks do well here to keep the humor in place while dramatic events unfold throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth)/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) dynamic was especially played well, and it was a hoot to see Thor accept Rabbit's, er..., Rocket's (voiced by Bradley Cooper) claim as captain of the Guardians. Where the film loses a point for me has to do with the inconsistency with some of the principal characters. Depending on which prior movie you care to cite, Thor and Doctor Strange have been positioned as the most powerful entities in the Marvel universe. However here, they were dispatched rather handily in the early going by Thanos's minions. There's also the quite literal overkill that occurs near the end of the story with the disintegration of heroes like Black Panther, Doc Strange and Spidey, along with the entire Guardian team. You know they have to make a come back in the follow up sequel(s), so it seemed like an almost cheap attempt to elicit pathos from the audience. By my count, at least fourteen Marvel characters met their demise in the story if you include Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner in the after credits scene.Once again, and I can't help it, but kudos to Stan Lee, Marvel comic writer and originator of many of these characters, for his bus driver cameo near the beginning of the picture. His one line was particularly apropos: ""What's the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?""And oh yes, don't want to forget this little tidbit. There have been any number of movies with scenes set in New York City in which the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are in prominent view prior to the events of 9/11, but in this flick, there's a quick glimpse offered of the new One World Trade Center rising from the city skyline. I thought that was very cool, and even better that it wasn't in the path of the New York City dust up.","

There is an audience (and a massive one willing to pay big bucks and stand in long lines ) who champion all of the Marvel Comics films. AVANGERS INFINITY WAR is no exception. At over two and a half hours even the huge cast of gifted actors - at their bet when being funny - explode, blow up things, zoom into outer space for a mission to find Thanos who goal is to rule the universe by obtaining all the funky jewels for his glove - all seem to wear thin from the plodding 'plot' and turn to dust. The true 'stars' of this huge effort are f course the CGI team - the special effects are truly spectacular, at least for the first hour. The characters don't get much time to develop but the actors assigned to the strange roles make the Avengers and their enemies entertaining. The 'plot'? 'As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.'Cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Vin Diesel, Benecio Del Toro, Chris Pratt, William Hurt, Josh Brolin, Gweneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper etc etc etc.
Definitely a film for those who follow Marvel Comics - or those who need an escape form the chaotic world we inhabit. 'That's entertainment?'.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","meinhard","23 May 2018","Superhero movies CAN be great. Not this one. Only giving this movie an extra star because Robert Downey, Jr. is the only good thing in this movie. This movie is WAY overrated here on IMDb. Probably fine for Marvel fan-millennials, but if you have not seen all the other movies or are over 40, my advice is to sit this one out. No plot, overuse of CGI, etc. etc.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","don-giovanni-forever","12 May 2018","Lets keep it real, the movie was overhyped by Marvel fanbois. And if we're being honest this movie actually deserves a 6 or 7 rating. It started weird, and as someone pointed out already the Order didnt get an introduction, and theres no need since theyre all dead. Escaping Asgard when Hella destroyed it was pointless since they're all dead as far as we know, unless Loki used some magic to hide them.. but going back to the beginning of the movie.... we dont know. It was a pile of shi and we need to stop rewarding crap with praise. Im sure part 2 will be better but very overhyped by fanbois, the weakest link in the chain","

"Avengers: Infinity War","upashnafuentes","25 April 2018","This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of ""everything is gonna be alright"" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I'm definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie.","

I won't waste my time and money on the next one.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","ericstevenson","30 April 2018","I'm just going to say right now that I don't believe this movie to be as good as the 2012 Avengers movie. It's still one of the best superhero movies ever made. Thanos had made brief appearances in literally three other Marvel movies and we finally got a film focusing on him. Even at the ending credits, it says that Thanos will return and not the Avengers! The plot's pretty standard with the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians Of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from collecting all the Infinity Gems making him the most powerful being in the Universe. The biggest part of this movie is the ending in which...they actually fail.Yep, Thanos gets everything he wants and immediately gains his goal of wanting to kill half the people in the entire Universe! There possibly hasn't been a movie with more deaths of named characters. This was in fact something that happened in the comics, but it seemed so crazy I had no idea it would actually happen here! It's a shame that we don't get to see all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy in the same place at the same time. I believe this is the longest Marvel movie ever made. It certainly didn't seem like it as the pacing was so great!They said this movie would be darker, but it seemed to have a lot of jokes at first. Then came the ending and even the ending credits seemed gloomy. We finally get to see Loki kick the bucket. It's great that we have the characters reference all of their losses. It's just one awesome action scene after another. Unlike ""Transformers"" these ones are beautiful looking and creative. ****","

"Avengers: Infinity War","willz187","28 February 2019","I'm probably the only fan of Super Hero Squad: Infinity Gauntlet but if you found this Avengers: Infinity War too heavy you should give it a try. Infinity War is filled with more super whiners than super heroes; unless you like your superheroes to whimper, demand to be sacrificed, argue, and to die. Not my idea of good times. Not lining up to see the sequel/conclusion. I'd rather read the comics, or watch it on cartoons. Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe.Try to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing. And it was cool to see so many Avengers represented. Had some cool scenes. Gave it a generous 6/10 but will never watch again.Hero up! and watch Super Hero Squad or for something less childish, Avengers Assemble Season 2, which also tells the story of Thanos.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","bgsmall","19 May 2018","Caveats on this review are; I'm no especial fan of comic book storylines made into films, my primary reason for attending was to take my children for their entertainment (not mine).As you might expect from a comic book rendering; the central plot of revolves around Thanos (the 'baddie') intent on decimating humanity by ~50% of it's current number to 'restore balance' to an over-crowded universe that has dwinding supplies and no means to support the ever growing populus. Taking that and the film at face value - this is a bizzare and macarbe storyline that hurtles between fight scenes without any character development or sub-plot development whatsoever (O.K, that's a little unfair - but not much). That's maybe my own fault - as I've not seen the other (precedent) movies in this series. However, as entertainment value goes, it's a little poor and in retrospect I would not have taken my children to see it.Now, taking the central plot as something 'other' than just fantasy I have a couple of questions / statements:
1. Is the storyline in anyway faithful to what was written in the comic book storylines?
2. Who signed off on the budget of this movie? - I'm guessing it cost $$$$$$$ (that's seven, each representing a 10-fold increase in magnitude) at least.
3. Whoever (individual or committee) did sign off on this budget, then also implicitly (or maybe explicitly) approved the premise of the central plot.
4. Given that Hollywood has been used historically to influence audiences and therefore by extrapolation (largely developed world) populations via it's 'messages' (propaganda) is this warning or threat? 
5. I don't believe that a movie of such an incredible budget is signed off without having an ulterior motive (usually paving the way for later films and more money) - and unless I've missed something - they just trashed the franchise??Just because I'm paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get me.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","ivan-samuelson","4 December 2018","Don't get me wrong. I love the Marvel Universe. I even went back to watch the original Iron Man and forgot that in those days, Disney didn't have their mitts on it yet. It was a Paramount movie. My how times have changed.For me, the movie was all over the place, jumping from earth, to a distant planet, etc. Yes, the war extends across the galaxy, that much is understood, but too many cross stories, and the entire former Avengers team isn't even together. It does set up the 2nd half that comes out in 2019 which looks lie there will be a head-on face-to-face again with two of the Avengers that split apart, especially since, well, you know why.All in all, the CGI graphics were excellent. Very top notch. But, a movie can only look so great before it falls under it's own weight, and I'm sorry, but AIW does just that. Editing is sub-par, there are some good one-liners, but I had just watched Ant Man and the Wasp just before this at home and that was a great movie for me. Funny, hilarious and action packed. This, so-so. Disney is trying way too hard here. Need to get back to reality and ground this series back to how it started.I dare say that AIW is the Marvel Universe's ""The Last Jedi"". Pretty to look at, but empty everywhere else.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","margerami","29 April 2018","(mild spoilers ahead)The movie is designed to appeal the viewers by the familiarity the audience has with the cast from all the previous installments. There are some humorous dialogues that are funny, which makes the movie deserve my second star. The effects are of course top notch, and one has to commend the technical aspect. 
 
Other than that, there is no logic whatsoever in the movie. Every exaggeration from the past has now been multiplied by a thousand. The plot could be summarized in a couple lines, with room to spare. I wish I had a time stone so that I can return to the past a few hours ago and tell me not to spend money on this disaster.",NA

A roller coaster ride of adventure I enjoyed it every minute and went out the theaters wanting to see more. So expect me to go see it again before it end its run.! No super hero movie has ever come close to what people at Marvel are doing at the moment. And Avengers Infinity War said that furthermore this movie soared through my expectations. The visual was spectacular the action was explosive and satisfying. The Russo's have crafted Something truly remarkable and freshness that you'd never expect. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing narrative possibilities that strech in any direction. On the strength of this outing, that's Something to be anticipated, rather than feared.I highly recomend everyone to go see it",NA
"Avengers: Infinity War","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","27 April 2018","Thanos(Brolin, giving us a layered villain, the best in recent years) has...*finally*... started to gather the Infinity Gems. If he gets all six he can wipe out half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. Will our heroes be able to stop him and his ""Children""?The hype for this was unreal. Many say that it couldn't live up to it. And I realise that a lot don't, and won't(as it premieres around the world), think it did. For my money(and they'll keep getting them as long as they keep making them this good), it delivered, and then some. Obviously, with so many major characters, they cannot possibly all get a lot of screentime. You could criticise their decision to include so many. Honestly, you're free to think so, but this is not a movie for you. Which is fine. I don't doubt that you love flicks that aren't for me. This is a cinematic version of an event comic, not decreased in scope as most of the adaptations of those stories are, something I've been waiting for for 20 years to be done right. So rather than complain about something that couldn't be helped, let's look at whether it's satisfying. Personally, I absolutely think so. I've loved most of these since I first saw these versions of them, and I felt that they were all featured to the right extent. Every single one of them makes an impact, most get arcs, not a single one feels like they're just in the background(as is the case with every single X-Men film).This wastes no time starting the plot, moves quickly, and introduces us to all the groups quite early on, and yet never feels overpowering. I realised the following is an old example, however, recently rewatching Revenge of the Sith, the difference is incredible. Both were built up to for years(at least 6 in both cases), and where that one is massively overcrowded, and quite tiring and tedious, this one isn't, even a little. I know. I can hardly believe it myself. It delivers on emotion, interaction between individuals, growth, in addition to action scenes(which, ultimately, is the bread and butter of a Summer blockbuster). Does it, outside of the bad guy's depiction, including personality and motivation, reach a level of depth akin to the solo adventures? No. It would be unrealistic to expect it to. It's not going for that. Finally, there has been a lot of reasonable concern, for how they would handle the supposed killing off of fan favorites. I'm not giving away whether or not they do, or if it's only for bit parts. What I will say is that everyone who kicks the bucket in this, on either side of the conflict, gets to be memorable and important before they do. They were very smart and how they handled that. Like everything else in this.I recommend this to anyone who finds it to be appealing. Do note that the ending is very much a setup for the next one, and doesn't feel conclusive. It used to be called part 1 for a reason. And yes, that will disappoint many - and they're not wrong. Personally, I'm just incredibly excited for Avengers 4. 10/10",NA
