"h7f3","24 February 2020","Thor is a film that takes risks - and they pay off wonderfully. The movie grounds itself in reality while keeping a mythological and fantasy-esqe tone, and it never loses sight of the humanity within the characters, with elevates this above standard superhero fare.","

"rparham","3 June 2011","In the pantheon of Marvel Superheroes, from my vantage point, Thor is a second-tier player. Even amongst non-obsessive comic aficionados, such as myself, Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, etc., have. However, that doesn't mean that Marvel Studios, the filmmaking wing of the company, feel inclined to give the filmic adaptation of Thor short shrift. The cinematic entry for this character, titled simply Thor, is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years, mixing a good sense of fun, strong acting, and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies.Liberally adapting portions of Thor comic book lore to fit in a more modern comic book film reality, Thor introduces us to a centuries old war between the Asgardians, beings that live for long periods of time and can travel through space from their home realm of Asgard to various other worlds, such as Earth, via the Bi-Frost bridge, and the conflict centric Frost Giants, whom the Asgardians conquered some time back. Odin (Anthony Hopkins), ruler of the Asgardians, is preparing to abdicate his throne to his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), but on the eve of Thor's inauguration, agents of the Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and attempt to steal back a device that is the key to their power, which had been taken by Odin at the end of their long struggle. When Thor disagrees with his father's desire to not to retaliate in order to not disturb the peace that currently exists between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants, he takes matters into his own hands, traveling to the Frost Giant's realm with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and compatriots Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Fandral (Josh Dallas) in tow. When the encounter with the Frost Giants ends with tensions re-ignited between the two factions, Odin decides that his son is not prepared to lead his people, and exiles Thor, sans his powers, to Earth.When he arrives on Earth, he is discovered by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who are convinced that he isn't a random homeless vagabond that they found in the middle of the desert. Thor must attempt to locate his power hammer, Mjolnir, from the government agents that have captured it, and attempt to reclaim his place in Asgard. However, he finds that, without his super-human abilities, and surrounded by humans, perhaps some of his previous attitudes were incorrect, especially when he connects romantically with Jane. Meanwhile, Loki, who turns out to have some ulterior motives, seizes control of Asgard following the collapse of Odin from strain, and begins to hatch a grand scheme involving the Frost Giants.Thor, much like Iron Man before it, proves that, in the right hands, a comic tale that appears silly on the surface can have hidden depths when properly plumbed. Sure, Thor has elements that, on the face of it, may lead a bit to some audience snickers (Thor's ability to pick himself up and fly and defeat attackers with little effort are a bit cheesy at times), but the creatives behind Thor, including director Kenneth Branagh, manage to develop a story for Thor that deals with elements of tragedy, pathos, selflessness and, perhaps even more surprisingly, involving character development. Thor is more about the lead characters at its core, again akin to Iron Man, than some other comic book films and this draws the audience into its tale.When it was first announced that Kenneth Branagh would be taking the reins of Thor as a director, it seemed something of an unusual fit for someone best known for his cinematic adaptations of the works of Shakespeare, but the final results of Thor bare out that Branagh was just the right man for the job. Considering the larger-than-life origins of the Thor comic, involving beings with the power and appearance of Gods and the various machinations of their story, the material fits fairly well with Branagh's body of work to a great extent. Especially strong is the development of Loki, who proves to be less of a traditional mustache twirling villain, and more of a misguided soul, trapped between revelations he makes about himself and his past and his respect in his father, making him more of a tragic figure than a black and white comic book antagonist.Thor benefits from strong acting from its leads, Hemsworth and Hiddleston. Hemsworth embodies Thor, first as the brash, acting-before- thinking hero, and later as a man faced with the reality that some of his choices and attitudes were not becoming of a king. Hemsworth really makes you empathize with Thor, and gives you a reason to root for the character throughout the film. Hiddleston, working with the somewhat subdued (at first) Loki eventually transforms him from a seeming weak, malleable person into one who's penchant for vengeance and control is revealed in layers, peeling back one by one through the development of the narrative.Thor isn't without its weak points, however. The romance between Thor and Jane Foster is practically and afterthought, rushed into the narrative at light speed and then not given any room to breathe or develop, it plays more as a requirement of adapting the comic story than something that works organically in the film. Portman is fine in the role, but the screenplay doesn't give enough to this relationship for it to be more than a bump in the road of the film's story.Once again, Marvel has managed to take one of their lesser known heroes and make them the subject of an entertaining film version, with energy and depth that is a bit unexpected. May they keep on making comic book films of this caliber.","

"sidfargas","18 April 2011","Thor was much much better than I expected. I didn't know if they could pull of the balance between the Norse mythology stuff and the real world Marvel Universe. I should've known better because Marvel knows their characters and knows what we want to see. Spider-Man set a new standard for the superhero film genre back in the day. Iron Man upped the ante. Thor takes the ball and runs with it and places that bar even higher. I look forward to seeing it again and know it will do well enough to be worthy of a sequel because word of mouth is going to be great. Trust me when I say Thor REALLY IS as good as Iron Man and is most worthy to be called one of the greatest adaptations ever.Chris Hemsworth as the Norse god Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as his villainous brother Loki show they have the acting ability and star quality to become mega-marquee names in the future. Marvel found two absolute diamonds in the rough. Both actors make a HUGE impression and are wonderful on screen. You knew Acedemy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman would bring it but these relative unkowns more than hold their own on screen. I know the script is written mostly for them but they carry it in a big way. From what I've read, Hemsworth and Hiddleston were cast almost a year in advance of filming the story so, they had time to get into shape and do character research. They certain did these long-time Marvel greats proud. Intelligent comic-book popcorn epics are rare and this one is definitely a cut above the usual fare.","

"bob the moo","21 September 2011","I had heard a lot of good things about this film before I eventually saw it. I had decided that I wasn't going to go and pay loads of money to sit in noisy cinemas and be bombarded with disappointing blockbusters this summer, but I figured that this had enough good word of mouth to be worth seeing. After watching it I browsed through the user comments here of writers I generally trust and found that most of them had loved it too; so why did I find it to be all a lot of fuss and nonsense that ultimately amounts to very little?I came to Thor with some worries despite the good word of mouth, I never cared for the character generally and he always seemed a little silly to me, with the Nordic god dialogue just making it worse. As a result I guess the script could have been worse because it would have been bogged down in this stuff but it never was, however this is not to say that it worked well. What it does is take us from point A to point B without ever really doing a huge amount of interest. It has enough humour in to stop it being too serious, but not enough to actually be light and fun. It has enough character in it to avoid it feeling wooden, but not enough to make one care. It has enough drama in it to set up the action, but not enough to provide actual tension or a sense of danger. To me it didn't seem to do anything in particular. I was looking for more sport to be made of this silly God once he was on earth but it didn't happen. In particular I was looking for Loki to be a more interesting ""baddie"" since he could have been a tragic, haunted character â€“ but we don't see this outside of his actions.This all came together for me to limit my interest in what was going on. The stuff in the heavens was all too full of mock Shakespearean shouting but without dramatic substance, while the stuff on Earth was too fleeting and lacking fun and entertainment value. For sure the film provides spectacle but again I just found it to be rather hollow as I watched it, enjoying it for the noise but not much else. The cast are varied. Although limited, Hemsworth is well-cast because he has the body and big voice to fill the character. He needed a good opposite number though and in Hiddleston he doesn't have it â€“ he doesn't have the presence needed or the depth of character. Portman has almost nothing to do and it shows in her performance, she is here for the sake of it and you could have digitally removed her from this film and made no difference to it. Ditto SkarsgÃ¥rdâ€“ at least Dennings provided some light relief. Hopkins adds a bit of gravitas to proceedings, while Elba has the frame and voice for his character. Like everyone else it surprises me still to think this was directed by Kenneth Branagh, but it is a smart career move for him to show he can do big budget effects movies â€“ if it does nothing else, it shows that.Thor feels like a film that had to be made rather than one that was created on its own merits. Of course, as part of The Avengers, this is true but it is irritating that you feel that way while watching it. It has noise and spectacle for those looking for that, but it lacks too much in the way of character, danger, humour and good old fashioned entertainment. You know when you buy a new product and the first few days it is shiny and great but then, in using it you spot lots of gaps and think ""why didn't they do this?"" and ""why did they not expand this function?"" â€“ well Thor is that product, shiny and noisy but ultimately one is left wondering why the makers didn't do a lot more in some regards and a lot less in others. Not an awful film â€“ but just a bog-standard one with a massive effects budget.","

"adrongardner","13 September 2011","Plain and simple - when the humans show up the movie dies a slow death.It's a superhero movie so you know what the plot is. Hero comes to Earth to help humans. They're basically riffing Superman to the Nth degree here. But on to the important stuff...What the heck is Natalie Portman doing in this movie. I mean that in two ways. First why is she even in the movie? Second, what did she do other than stand there and let her hair be blown around by the off screen wind machines? It felt like all of her scenes were filmed in one day and she looks so bored in all of them. Chris Hemsworth was fine as Thor and Hopkins played a good Odin, but it was the human characters that kill this one.At least Branagh threw in Skarsgard for the Swede inside joke. But as usual Stellan Skarsgard is totally wasted. After Insomnia I was just in awe of what the man is truly capable of and here in the states they always use him as a window curtain.I didn't mind the first act all that much, but for a movie about the GOD OF THUNDER, it comes off surprisingly meek.","

"theycallmemrglass","20 April 2011","I watched this last night at a preview screening in London.I prayed that Kenneth Branagh would learn from his mistakes with handling a big budget movie, namely his Frankeinstein. Thankfully, I am glad to say he learnt a great deal from those mistakes. Of course, this is no Henry V, this is just pure popcorn entertainment but a thoroughly enjoyable introduction to Thor for the big screen. Chris Hemsworth played the part with a lot of energy, charisma and I have to admit from a bloke's point of view, annoying good looks. Anthony Hopkins added much needed heavyweight presence as Odin but its a role he has quite frankly played a gazillion times but I never tire of it, so I'm not complaining. In a year long span of brilliantly playing vastly different roles from psychotic to swashbuckling heroine, Natalie Portman this time plays the sweet determined scientist girl who falls for the strangely mannered good looking guy. Nothing too taxing for any of them but they do give a re-assuring aura about them.The visuals were quite spectacular, mainly, the sweeping canvas of Asgard. The action scenes were also good though I thought could have been executed better with lesser use of the fast cut edit style that is too often the norm in action film these days.There is plenty of humour when Thor is on Earth but not in a put-off way as there is a suitable contrast of a serious tone with everything set in Asgard. Even though the storyline was somewhat predictable, it was still a riveting one.For those like me, who were concerned about how Thor fits into the established Marvel connected universe set by the Iron Man films need not worry. That is just another thing that Branagh and crew pulls off very well. We can now fully embrace the forthcoming Avengers where a God, a man who transforms into a giant green beast, and a man who flies in a hi tech amour suit can share the same screen. So its all coming together nicely.And make sure you stay for the end credit scenes. In case you did not know of this before, I urge you to go back to the previous films (Iron Man 1 & 2, Incredible Hulk) and watch the end of credit sequences if you haven't already. They tell a separate story strand that will culminate to a certain upcoming Marvel movie. The end credit sequence of Thor is the most fascinating yet as it actually takes a major plot development in the story strand ;) And it was the longest bloody end of credit sequence I've ever seen in any movie! One last thing, the film I saw was in 3d and once again, it practically nearly ruined all the action scenes for me. In the non action scenes, it was pretty useless and just simply made the film much darker.","

"claudio_carvalho","25 September 2011","In 965 D.C., in Tornsberg, Norway, the Frost Giants from Jotunheim led by King Laufey (Colm Feore) attack the locals, and the Allfather Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and the warriors of Asgard protect the humans and win the battle against the invaders. They take their source of power and bring it to Asgard and they start an armistice with Jotunheim. When three Frost Giants break in Asgard trying to retrieve their source of power, they are destroyed by the Destroyer. The arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) decides to attack Jotunheim with his stepbrother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and four Asgardian warriors and disobeys the order of his father Odin. In order to avoid war against Jotunheim, Odin removes the powers of Thor and exiles him on Earth to live among the humans. Odin also throws his hammer MjÃ¶lnir to New Mexico and orders that only the one that is worth will get the powerful hammer and achieve Thor's powers. In Puente Antigo, New Mexico, the physician Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is researching a phenomenon in the desert with her professor Erik Selvig (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) and her mate Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). Out of the blue, Thor is hit by Jane's truck and she takes him to the hospital. Thor unsuccessfully tries to retrieve MjÃ¶lnir that is protected by agents of the government SHIELD. When the Machiavellian Loki sends the Destroyer to Earth to kill Thor, he needs to retrieve his hammer to save not only the humans, but also his Allfather Odin and Asgard from the evil Loki.""Thor"" is an entertaining adventure based on the character of the comic book published by Marvel Comics. Natalie Portman is usually the synonym of a good movie and she is delightful in the role of a scientist. The plot is funny and the scenes with the human Thor; the Nordic black gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba); and the Vikings and Gods speaking in English are hilarious. The special effects are top-notch and the viewer may bring the popcorn and delight with a pleasant family entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Thor""","

"dvc5159","6 May 2011","Alright, back when this was into preproduction, I (and so many comic book fans) were surprised when Branagh was slated to direct. Here we have Thor the god of lightning and his mighty hammer, directed by a man who works mostly around William Shakespeare plays.Thankfully, this helps. A lot.Almost every superhero movie (Marvel, lately) focuses on more action instead of character development. Sure, they may look awesome, but you get used to it. Branagh bravely steers away from this predicament and directs the actors with such skill and flair you may mistake this film for yet another Branagh/Shakespeare costume epic.Make no mistake this is still a superhero film, with some nice special effects and a stylish production design for Asgard, but there's a nice human twist to the story - that of dueling brothers, or gods, or god- brothers... you get the idea. Chris Hemsworth looks just about right for the part and shows some charisma as well as the hero. Branagh has assembled an interesting mix of actors - we have the great Anthony Hopkins, the cute Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Idris Elba and even Rene Russo. Tom Hiddleston however steals the scene as the mischievous brother Loki.Here's another good thing about the movie - the story and acting outweigh the special effects and action sequences. For a superhero film, this is extremely rare. Branagh deserves kudos for the effort, however some parts do not gel in nicely and there's some action bits that are not too well-filmed.All is forgiven though - ""Thor"" is an above-average superhero movie, not extremely exciting, but definitely intriguing. Fans of both comic book films and costume dramas will certainly enjoy this.Two words of caution - one, keep an eye out for some cameos, both during and after the film. Two, for goodness sake do not watch it in 3D. I saw it in normal 2D and that's fine enough by me. I didn't see anything worth watching in 3D in it.Overall rating: 68/100","

"AngelHonesty","28 December 2019","Great movie! Has a comic book feel to it. The storyline is very well done! I love how they show Asgard and explain how everything fits into place. The humor is very tasteful, but can be oddly quirky in places. Lots of fun action. The only thing that could have used some improving was the way they filmed the movie. The shakey camera and weird angles are a little annoying, but the rest of the film makes up for this. Very good choice in the cast, could not have picked a better actor for Thor or Loki. Natalie Portman's part isn't the best. She has cheesy lines and her acting doesnt flow right, even though she is a talented actress. She does better with serious parts inatead of light and comical. This movie is very clean and makes a great fun movie for the entire family.","

"namashi_1","29 April 2011","Based on comic book character of the same name published by Marvel Comics, 'Thor' is Entertainment At It's Best! Put on your 3D glasses, and I can assure you, your in for a roller-coaster ride, that is filled with stunning effects, entertaining moments & intriguing performances.Directed by Kenneth Branagh, 'Thor' tells the story Thor, The god of thunder based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. It's the Journey of Thor, the powerful, arrogant yet heroic character, that is the latest addition to the host of Superheroes.The Writing is Spot-On from start to end. In fact, Thor and his entire motivations, powers & ark, come out wonderfully. The Action Sequences are bombastic, while the Special Effects, as mentioned before, are stunning and come as a pleasure to your eyes. The 3D impact is definitely not missing here, as there are truly clap-worthy moments that look even more bigger due to the glasses on.Kenneth Branagh's directs this Heroic tale, efficiently. And He is blessed with a catchy storyline & rich special effects. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing is good.Performance-Wise: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, is awesome and carries the film on his shoulders from start to end. He is indeed a mega-star in the coming time. Natalie Portman is very sincere. Sir Anthony Hopkins is okay, while Tom Hiddleston is every effective as the bad guy. Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd & Kat Dennings are passable. Ray Stevenson, Idris Elba, Colm Feore & Joshua Dallas leave a mark. Rene Russo gets limited scope.On the whole, Don't give 'Thor' a miss. This one's a winner all the way!","

"Bioscopic_Wonders","28 June 2020","The Marvel magic continues with Thor, as they create yet another throrouly enjoyable, fun, action packed and humourous adventure, where we're introduced to a bigger universe extending far beyond Earths realm.What this movie does perfectly is ground the characters, and link them to our reality so that even though we're dealing with the mystical Frost Giants or the humoungous Destroyer, the characters do not appear other worldly or over powered to the existing superheroes.The visuals are captivating, whether it be the splendours of Asgard or the chilly Jotunheim, the CGI is excellent. The story is crisply told, fast paced and simple, taking us across the realms and giving us a background to some really interesting, well written and well portrayed characters.Chris Hemsworth nails the role of Thor with this charm, comic timing and of course good looks. He brings across the carefree, impulsive Thor while also showing a compassionate, gentle side to the character who'd otherwise have been all brawn and no brain.Antony Hopkins is brilliant as ever, playing Odin Allfather with all the gravitas that the ruler of the nine realms should possess. He shows his steely, ruthless side, as well as his soft, wise nature with elan.With Tom Hiddleston Marvel have struck gold when it comes to antagonist. His portrayal of Loki is by far the best negative character in the Marvel universe thus far. The God of mischief oozes charisma and brings out his underlying conflicts to perfection.Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgard play important roles in helping Thor in his transformational journey, and we get small bits and pieces of Idris Elba and Jeremy Renners Heimdall and Hawkeye with a hope that they'd play meatier parts in future movies.The action sequences are frequent and fun, there's a lot of humour, especially as Thor adjusts to the ways of the Earth and it keeps you engaged from the start to the end.All in all, this film provides a perfect introduction to other worldly elements to be incorporated later in the MCU while managing to hold its own as a spectacle.It may not be on par with Iron Man when it comes to a deep, rich story line, but it's the closest a movie in the MCU has come so far in touching those grand heights.","

"Chalice_Of_Evil","21 April 2011","I'd never read a Thor comic, nor had I been following this movie's progression until a trailer was released, the first of which I didn't think was great, but the second of which I thought looked promising. To my surprise, this film turned out to be one of my favourite comic book films ever. The story's interesting without being overly convoluted, starting in an unlikely place as we meet astrophysicist, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who works alongside scientists, Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Selvig (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd), and she makes a memorable first impression as she accidentally hits Thor (Chris Hemsworth) with her car (on more than one occasion). He's been cast out of Asgard for going against the wishes of his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and picking fights with the Frost Giants. Meanwhile, his devious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is plotting against him (which Odin *really* should've seen coming, as having two sons and telling them that only 'one' can be King never ends well).Aussie actor Chris Hemsworth (who did a lot with a little in 2009's Star Trek) is easily likeable in the role, not only meeting the physical requirements of a god, but also displaying a comedic side and at the same time proving himself capable of selling the more serious/dramatic moments (there were two scenes which stood out to me. The first being his fight with his father just before he's banished, which felt like a very *real* father/son argument, as Thor clearly realizes he's gone too far after insulting his dad. The other moment was a particularly emotional one once Thor is delivered some devastating news by his manipulative trickster of a brother whilst being stuck on Earth without his powers. Hemsworth really sells that despite his bravado, Thor is just a son who misses home and cares about his father even when he doesn't see eye-to-eye with him. It was a very underrated scene, I felt).I, for one, felt Natalie Portman's Jane Foster wasn't the typical dull 'love interest' role that seems to plague a lot of comic book movies. She's intelligent and actually has a lighter side than most love interests, thankfully not being dead serious all the time. She's ably supported by SkÃ¥rsgard (this is the first time I've liked him in a role) and Dennings (who steals every scene she's in as Darcy, bringing some genuinely amusing humour to the film). While it would have been easy for the scenes set on Earth to feel 'slower'/more 'boring' than those set in Asgard, it's these three human characters and their interaction with Thor that keeps their scenes interesting/entertaining. There is much humour to be found in the fish-out-of-water situation that Thor finds himself in, the relationship that develops between him and Jane isn't over-done and where we leave the two of them at the end of the film wasn't quite what I expected.Thor's allies back on Asgard prove interesting as well. His friends (referred to at one point as ""Xena, Jackie Chan and Robin Hood"". I'd add that the fourth looks like a taller version of Gimli from LotR) aren't just one-dimensional characters. They're actually each unique, bringing something different to the table (I especially enjoyed the moment where they're reunited with Thor on Earth and wave to him happily, thus showing they're just your typical best friends albeit with godly powers). The one who made the most impression, though, was Lady Sif played by Jaimie Alexander, who kicks just as much ar$e as the 'Warriors Three' but isn't just a 'tough chick', as she also displays real emotion...especially for Thor, as evidenced by her beaming smile when his powers are fully restored after his self-sacrifice. I found the moment where he looked to have been dealt a fatal blow by a giant metal energy beam-shooting robot called the Destroyer (the noisiest damn thing I've heard at the cinema in a LONG time) emotionally impactful (the music also helped). Anthony Hopkins commands the screen whenever he appears, though spends the latter half out of commission. Loki, meanwhile, I thought was an okay villain. I know he's got his fanboys/fangirls, but I personally found his character to be the typical jealous brother with daddy issues and I grew tired of shouty moments. His helmet left a bigger impression on me than he did.What the film excels at is the visuals. Asgard is truly a wonder to behold. There's a rainbow bridge, the city looks like a giant golden pipe organ, and the way they travel to Earth is particularly memorable. Then there's the fights Thor gets into. Everything from fearsome battles with Frost Giants on Asgard to rough & tumble fist fights in the mud with burly humans on Earth, taking on the Destroyer (despite all odds against him), and finally his inevitable fight against Loki at the end. The film certainly has no shortage of fight scenes, each one well-done/different from the last. When Thor finally regains his powers and once again wields his mighty hammer, MjÃ¶lnir (which Darcy hilariously calls 'Mew Mew'), aka the BEST. WEAPON. EVER...it's quite the sight to behold.Kenneth Branagh's direction is a large part of what makes this film so good (even if he tends to overuse the 'Dutch angle' camera shot). The costumes look great and the movie manages to make them, as well as the Frost Giants, not be laughable in appearance. Apart from the look of the film, what also helps it feel epic is the score. The music adds SO much, being majestic/memorable, and I also liked the rockin' end credits song. Speaking of the end credits, as with previous MCU films, there's an extra post-credits scene. For a film I hadn't given much thought to, it was a delightful surprise to find myself thoroughly enjoying Thor. It's a comic book movie that stands out from a lot that have come before, and is genuinely entertaining on all accounts. I, for one, can't wait to see more of ol' Blondebeard.","

"featheredsun","8 September 2011","This is a throw-off piece of Marvel fiction that is packed full of clichÃ© and predictability...to a point.I found myself cringing at a lot of the scenes of heroism and there's a definite stink of pure cheetos-stained fanboyism in many of the scenes in general, with the usual over-the-top ""glory"" of this old four-color trope.But certain things caught my attention as well-done.First, Asgard is absolutely beautiful. They went all out in making a realm of metallic and elemental grandeur. I had no trouble in buying this as the realm of Asgard, the ultimate land of beautiful heroism. In particular, the rainbow bridge, the weaponry, and the interior scenes were very fitting in general style and specific detail. Very impressive visually and even thematically.Second, Branagh's touch can be seen with Shakespearean flair in the family of Odin the AllFather. Odin himself is brimmed with both the rime of age and the wisdom that comes with it and yet his voice can instantly summon fearful authority. Hopkins does well with that balance, even through some cheesy scripting.And the brothers... the sibling rivalry here is very very potent in that it is nuanced and fully realized by both actors. There is love there, but also a lack of understanding, envy, and hate. Loki is far from a cardboard villain, in that we see, all in one package - a fighter who protects his allies, an honest counselor, a liar, a cautious thinker, a smooth tongue, and an awkward one. He loves and reveres his father, but comes to almost fatally doubt him and even hate him...but it's all very real and very stirring. And even when it's clear that he's done very grim deeds, you can actually understand and accept his motives...and his last scene in the film brings all three of the family men together in a very poignant moment of utter loss.I was pretty surprised how moving this all was, especially when put in the middle of some otherwise-uninspiring hero pablem.So in summary, this movie both met my negative expectation of disappointment and surprised me with some purely moving content. See it to see if it surprises you at all as well, and forget the whole comic-book hero thing, since that's been done far better.Thanks for reading.","

"ocacia","7 May 2011","Did professionals write this film? Did Antony really read the script or did he just see the figures in the contract? I think Nat and Tony need new agents, because you do not go from Silence of lamb and Black Swan *respectively* to this utter junk.I do not know what other people saw but there is nothing good or unique in this film. The special effects actually made me tired. And lets talk about the story? My Lord, where was it and when did it begin. I got the feeling that the script was written after the action sequences were planned. They therefore said we want this effect and this effect now lets write a film around that. We need to use up Nat so lets force a romance into the script. We want jokes, so lets force a few of those in there. So much dead space in the film that doesn't arch into anything.scenes seem random and disconnected, like writing in junk to get it to a feature length time. drifting focus, drifting priorities. And no great moments that saved the film.Also it is an overnight transformation from utter arrgoance to humility. Does anyone identify with any characters here? Did you understand the brothers motives? Makes no real sense in the real world. Did the film introduce anything for anyone to attach themselves to emotionally? No. Characters appear in odd order without any development. Actually while I am here typing I just realized something : This film is below the dignity of critique. It is so poor, so badly directed and written that to even point out the weak character development or random script turns give too much credit to it. I will therefore cease to add speak about it for fear of giving someone the illusion that there is anything to actually speak about in terms of artistic critique.","

I'm sure anyone reading this knows what i'm getting at, they either get these right or they get them wrong. Well this ones right, very right, from start to finish, epic, spectacular, warm, funny, action packed. The story draws you in, the characters are likable, the pace is just right, doesn't race along, but doesn't plod either. Great cast, particularly Chris Hemsworth, if Captain America and Green Lantern can keep up this standard then it'll be a good summer season.Ken's pulled it all together. Go and watch it, i cant imagine you wont enjoy it and if you think i'm being paid to say this then get stuffed !!","

"estebangonzalez10","2 May 2011","Â¨Whoever wields this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.Â¨ With Thor, summer movies have officially started in Hollywood. It's not one of my favorite seasons of the year for films, but if the rest of the movies can live up to what Kenneth Branagh has accomplished with Thor it will be an exciting and entertaining season at the movies. I wasn't a huge fan of Thor before this movie came out, I wasn't even expecting too much out of it, but I decided to go see it because he's still one of The Avengers and I couldn't miss out on all the propaganda that began with Iron Man. With each one of these films my expectations for The Avengers is rapidly building, and even Thor managed to win me over to his side. The first thing I can say about the movie is that it was entertaining enough for me to want to go see it twice in two days. The story, the visuals, the strong performance from two relatively unknown actors like Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are all factors that contribute to making this movie successful. Include Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins into the mix and you have an even better film. The directing had a lot to do with it as well because Kenneth Branagh is a serious and dedicated director; he has proved it time after time with his adaptations of Shakespearean plays. He was dedicated with this project as well; adapted this Marvel comic superhero and prepared him for the big screen. Like most every Marvel character, they are very well developed and the film is no exception remaining true to the comic.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is the son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) the god of Asgard. He is a great warrior and his father has been preparing him to be the future King of Asgard. It is no easy task because Asgardians are the keepers of the peace in all nine realms (Earth being one of those realms). They can travel from one realm to another through the Forest which is guarded by Heimdall (Idris Elba). Odin saved Earth from extinction many centuries ago when the Frost Giants tried to destroy the planet. Odin defeated them and took away their power so they could no longer leave their planet, Jotunheimr. Odin has kept the peace during all these years but now it's time to proclaim Thor as his heir to the throne. On the day of his proclamation something unexpected occurs and three Frost Giants manage to enter Asgard and almost steal the cube which holds their power. However The Destroyer does his job and kills the invaders before they can do any harm. Thor is furious and wants to give the Giants a lesson, but Odin wants to maintain peace and orders Thor to remain in Asgard. Against his father's command Thor travels to Jotunheimr with his younger brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the 3 warriors: Volstagg, Hogun, and Fandral, and Sif (Jaime Alexander). Together they face the Giants who tell them there is a traitor in Asgard. Odin discovers that Thor disobeyed his command, rescues the warriors from the Frost Giants but vanishes Thor to Earth without his supernatural powers. In Earth Thor meets a group of scientists: Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and Darcy (Kat Dennings) who help him rediscover his path.I can imagine how difficult it was to try to make a serious movie out of all this Norse mythology about the nine realms and so on, but Branagh pulls it off by combining humor with the story. For instance when the three warriors come to Earth to find Thor, the unbelievable situation is toned down with a lot of humor. The same can be said with the Destroyer when he arrives at Earth to try to destroy Thor. When the SHIELD agents first see this metal giant they believe it could be one of Stark's creations. So whenever the plot seems to be getting ridiculous, the tone of the film is cooled down with a lot of humor. The funniest character is Darcy who with clever one-liners manages to steal most laughs. I liked Kat Dennings in Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, but here once more she proves she is a talented actress. The true stars of the film however are Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. Hemsworth plays Thor to perfection, and Hiddleston is excellent as Loki. The scene where he realizes his true identity is perhaps one of the most dramatic and best acted sequences in the movie. I know we are being bombarded with a lot of superhero movies, but as long as they keep on making them this entertaining I have no problem with that. Thor is no Dark Knight, or even Iron Man for that matter, but it still is a very good film. I will end my review by quoting my six year old brother's words after the movie ended: Â¨I don't want to have an Iron Man party for my birthday anymore. I want it to be Thor!Â¨ http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","

"moviexclusive","29 April 2011","The Norse god Thor is admittedly one of Marvel's second-league  superheroes, but just like Iron Man, both are inevitable steps in  Marvel's continuing march towards arguably the most highly anticipated  comic book adaptation in movie history next year- ""The Avengers"". Yet,  if there's anything to learn from the ""Iron Man"" experience, it's that  it's entirely possible to turn a B-league superhero into an A-grade  feature film with just the right star and the right director.   And kudos to the Marvel team for doing it once again with ""Thor"", a  thoroughly entertaining blockbuster of a film that succeeds thanks to  the unlikely choices of Kenneth Branagh as director and Chris Hemsworth  as the star of the titular character. Kenneth is the English director  best known as cinema's foremost exponent of the Bard, while Chris is  the Australian actor probably only known as the father to James T. Kirk  in last year's ""Star Trek"". Both are equally unlikely choices to  headline this US$150mil tentpole, though Marvel's gamble has paid off  handsomely.   Unlike Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, or for that matter the upcoming  Captain America who were products of science, Thor was the hammer-  wielding alien-god who was always going to be a tricky proposition  adapting for the big screen. After all, the combination of Norse  mythology and science fiction could easily have degenerated into  kitschy camp, so it's a good thing that Kenneth knows when to get  serious and when to have fun. He films the scenes of Thor in his  homeland Asgard with the utmost gravitas, while leaving the humour for  his brief fish- out-of-water stint on Earth.  Indeed, Kenneth handles the power feuds and sibling rivalry with the  same intensity as he would a Shakespearian production, and brings a  deeply human perspective to his godly characters. In particular, the  tussle between father and sons is emotionally charged- whether Odin's  heartbreak at banishing his son Thor, whom he was about to coronate as  king, out of the kingdom for arrogantly and impetuously reigniting a  war with an ancient enemy; or Loki's confrontation with Odin about his  true origins- and therefore electrifying to watch.   To add weight to the proceedings at Asgard, Kenneth brings in two  excellent character actors alongside Chris- Anthony Hopkins and Tom  Hiddleston. Anthony's patriarchal role isn't new for the actor, but he  delivers a restrained yet powerful and dignified performance as Thor's  father Odin. Tom, on the other hand, is deliciously snarky playing the  sibling jealous of Thor's impending ascension to the throne, and the  British actor gives a surprisingly intimate and affecting villainous  turn that brings unexpected depth to his character.   In contrast to the godly solemnity, Kenneth brings some welcome Earthly  humour to Thor's subsequent banishment. The trio of scriptwriters  Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne (working from an  effective origin story by J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich)  reserve the movie's wittiest lines for Thor's interplay with three  mortal beings- astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), her  gal-pal/assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) and Jane's mentor, Dr.  Erik Sevig (Stellan Skarsgard), while Kenneth directs Thor's awkward  adjustment to life on Earth (an absolutely hilarious scene has Thor  storming into a pet store and asking for a horse to go about his  mission to find his mysterious magical hammer Mjolnir) with just the  right amount of infectious fun.  There's also an intercelestial romance thrown in for good measure, as  Thor and Jane develop a growing attraction for each other. But more  than just obligatory, the love between god and human becomes a lesson  in humility and self-sacrifice for the fallen Thor to pave his  restoration back to glory. Though thinly written, Portman makes the  best out of her role, and it is to her credit that Jane becomes an  engaging and believable character that the audience roots for. Portman  also shares a warm chemistry with Chris, which brings poignancy to  their relationship as well as Thor's subsequent transformation.  Thor's time on Earth is also used to forge the necessary narrative  links with ""The Avengers"", in the form of Clark Gregg's S.H.I.E.L.D.  agent Coulson, an unbilled cameo by Jeremy Renner as the archer  Hawkeye, and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury appearance right at the end  of the credits. Fans of the Thor universe from the comic books will  also delight in the awe-inspiring presence of Heimdall (Idris Elba), as  well as Thor's entourage of Asgard warrior pals Sif (Jaimie Alexander),  Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Josh Dallas), and Hogun (Tadanobu  Asano).   These pals also add colour to the action sequences, which Kenneth  choreographs with surprising aplomb. He stages a thunderous battle very  early on as Thor leads an attack against the Frost Giants on the planet  of Jotunheim with every bit of might and muscle one would expect from a  clash of godly beings. There are at least two other money sequences-  Thor's duel with a hulking piece of metal known as the Destroyer (which  Coulson first tongue-in-cheek mistakes to be one of Stark's equipment)  in a small New Mexico town; and the thrilling climactic battle between  Thor and Loki back on Asgard.   But the star that holds it all together is really Chris Hemsworth, his  performance a well-calibrated blend of brawn and heart that will put  sceptics to rest. His physicality is apparent right from the start, but  Chris gradually reveals a winning charm and a heartfelt sincerity that  enables his audience to relate with his character's inner struggles. It  is a breakout star-making turn, which shows Chris adept at action,  comedy and even romance.   And certainly, it is to Kenneth Branagh's credit that these disparate  elements can belong so comfortably in a movie that also combines  mythology and science fiction. True to its origins, ""Thor"" is nothing  less than superhero entertainment, and a definitive A-list one -despite  the initial regard of its source character- that kicks off this summer  with a bang, boom and rumble.","

"planktonrules","5 May 2011","I had very low expectations for this movie when my daughter dragged me to the 12:01am showing of ""Thor"" on opening night here in the States. After all, I've never read the comic and there didn't seem to be all that much publicity concerning this film--and I just thought it would be one of Marvel's lesser films. However, when the film began I was absolutely blown away. It had to be the most beautiful and mind-blowing superhero film ever--with gorgeous visuals of other worlds that even sci-fi films haven't come close to matching. And, combined with nice 3-D effects and an exceptional score, you just turn off your brain and absorb it all--like some sort of mind-altering drug! And speaking of the score, while the ""Iron Man"" soundtracks were great (with LOTS of great AC/DC tunes among others), ""Thor"" chose instead to mostly use original compositions--and they were gorgeous.Fortunately, in addition to the gorgeous visuals and music, the film had a very good story, nice acting and great direction--by none other than Kenneth Branagh (yes THAT Kenneth Branagh). I also admire the script--it had a lot of excitement and occasional humor that made the film more than just an action film crammed with amazing stunts. Well done--and hopefully the film will catch on--it deserves to do very, very well. I'd say this one was about on par with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"" in quality and entertainment value--proving that even film snobs like me can enjoy some good escapist entertainment now and again.By the way, I did have one complaint about the film. It had among the most obvious and annoying product placement I've ever seen. I got absolutely sick of seeing 7-11, Southwest Airline and Kashi crammed onto the screen. Could Paramount Studio do any worse to whore out this film?! For shame, as the film was terrific but was cheapened a bit by this crass corporate decision. Oh well, at least they weren't paid to place laxatives or hemorrhoid creams in the film!","

"bkoganbing","27 May 2011","The Marvel Comic hero Thor of course based on the ancient Norse God of Thunder comes to the big screen in a fine version with very nice computer graphic special effects. And it has the added attraction of a classical actor like Kenneth Branagh directing and having the lines of the Norse immortals spoken as if the Bard had written them. As played by Chris Hemsworth, Thor's been exiled to Earth, the last time he visited there was when the ancient Norse were worshiping him and other such beings who visited from Asgaard. Thor's a warrior, but it takes more than being mighty in battle to rule as his father Odin keeps patiently trying to tell him.Anthony Hopkins another actor with classical acting chops plays Odin and I wonder if Hopkins might have envied Laurence Olivier for getting the plum role of Zeus in a film. He's now equaled him in playing another immortal deity.Thor lands on Earth, New Mexico to be specific and runs into scientific researcher Jane and she tickles his fancy the same way that other Jane rang Tarzan's bell. Natalie Portman is the object of Hemsworth's affections. But back on Asgaard Thor's brother Loki as played by Tom Higglesworth is plotting a palace coup of his own. That leads to a really spectacular fight to the finish as Thor's mighty hammer gives a few folks an attitude adjustment.Branagh served up a fine tasty dish for those who like their comic book heroes. Hopefully we'll see these folks again in some further adventures.","

"aernest","16 May 2011","Though I'm old and did read some comics in my time, Thor was never one of them. I do teach some Norse mythology, though, so that aspect interested me. There was an odd steampunk approach to the mythology, which was OK, I suppose. I really didn't expect this movie to be War and Peace, and I was certainly right on the money with that. It went for the snarky Iron Man approach more than I thought it would. It's hard to pull off without veteran snarkmeister Robert Downey, Jr., though. Chris Hemsworth is impossibly charming and good- looking in the title role, and does pretty well, considering some of the lines he had to say. Anthony Hopkins is a safe choice for his patented Older Mentor/Authority Figure performance (enjoy that check, Anthony), and Tom Hiddleston is somewhat intriguing as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard is completely wasted in a role that could have been phoned in. But you know who really stinks up the joint? Natalie Portman. It was DAMN hard to believe she was an astrophysicist, but it was even harder to believe that THOR (god of thunder, possessor of unspeakable power) would find her even remotely interesting. All she does is whine. The alleged falling in love is quite unbelievable, BTW. Yeesh. I hope the inevitable sequel loses her character.","

"Enchorde","1 May 2011","Being a comic book based movie, Thor comes with a special set of expectations. Good action, a myth based story of heroes, high level of special effects, and some quick one-liners. Thor meets and in my opinion surpasses all these expectations.Actually, Thor, is a really good, entertaining movie. It is two hour pure entertainment, handled skillfully by Kenneth Branagh. That gives the best of two worlds, the supernatural story combined with the touch by acclaimed director and actor Branagh.But Branagh has had good help on this one. Especially the effect makers has had great success. I loved how they portrayed Asgard, and they handled all the effects very well. Apart from being entertaining, Thor is also impressive and surprisingly rather beautiful. The casting department also has made a great job. Combining solid veteran actors as Hopkins, Portman and SkarsgÃ¥rd with virtual newcomers as Hemsworth and Dallas. Hemsworth is well casted as Thor, having both the right physique, looks and talent to deliver such a role. Hiddleston as Loki was a good choice as well. But the gem among the characters, and a personal favorite must be Idris Elba as Heimdall.Well, the main thing anyhow is that Thor is an action filled movie spiced up with some good humor. It had both thrilling fights and good laughs. And it stood upon a good story as framework. As I said above, it was entertaining all the way.I like the tie-ins with the other superhero movies released and look forward to seeing the Avengers, but I also hope that Thor itself might get a sequel. They certainly laid the ground work for one.8/10","

"bassrourke","17 April 2011","Having just seen the global premiere of Thor - God of Thunder, in Sydney Australia, all I can say is ....wow! Don't worry readers I am not about to give away one single spoiler, however after some time and anticipation, Thor is a winner. Australian Chris Hemsworth graced the red carpet in all his native glory, talking up the film and his future entity in The Avengers. He was joined by Shakespeare aficionado Director Kenneth Brangh and co stars Jamie Alexander & Tom Hiddleston who plays crowd favourite Loki. Thor is a good movie, plenty of action, a lovely heroine (Natalie Portman) and some interesting sidekicks. Costumes rock, not to mention the obligatory Marvel characters making significant cameos, not just the extra scene after the credits, but within the film itself. I was a little over superhero movies recently but this is not to be missed.","

"MLDinTN","13 March 2012","Chris Hemsworth is very hot. I never noticed him in a movie before, but there is one too short scene of him shirtless, that is not to be missed. Other than that, I thought this movie was OK with the beginning being the best part and I didn't care for the ending. The first 45 minutes was very entertaining with some good special effects. Basically the first part is about Thor's people and their conflict with the frost giants. The frost giants invade and Thor with his other brother, Loki, and friends go to the frost giant land looking to start a war. We see some of the cool powers Thor has with his hammer. But the King is furious and banishes Thor to earth minus his powers and that's when the movie starts to get duller. He meets scientist, Natalie Portman, whom of course he falls for. I thought there should have been funnier scenes between Thor and regular people. He gets in trouble with the Feds, but just gets released, then the ending is this giant robot that is some how controlled by Loki from the other planet. Then the final battle between Thor and Loki, I just thought the latter scenes were not as entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the comic book movies, then I'm sure you will want to see this.","

"billygoat1071","8 May 2011","In ""Thor"", I don't think the action is the big deal here while it's a movie from Marvel. Kenneth Branagh is more fond to tell the story, which is a better thing. The changes of the story of ""Thor"" is very fascinating. It's not a generic superhero movie that has a weak man becoming a superhuman then ends with a lot of action mess. It's more of a compelling drama fantasy with a little action and a lot more sense. ""Thor"" has some problems with the action but who cares, it's definitely great & entertaining.First goes to the performances. Chris Hemsworth hams it up (no pun intended. he really did) although he is quite entertaining. Anthony Hopkins, he made Odin more than what we expect him to do. Tom Hiddleston's portrayal made Loki the best villain in the universe of the Avengers so far.The action of the first act was pretty good. Plodding at times but when it comes to earth scenes, it's becoming somewhat unexpectedly boring. Kenneth Branagh has problems in making some of the action scenes but he has the heart to tell the story. It's amazing how the changed story and the performance are more mind-blowing than the action since this is a superhero movie. As you expected in a Marvel movie, ""Thor"" is hilarious at times.While some of the action scenes weren't mind-blowing, The visuals were good. Asgard is beautifully made by the effects and the solid production design. Some of the effects are like video game graphics though. The cinematography has a tilted camera style to make it a better experience to the movie. The score is your standard fantasy music.""Thor"" is a little disappointing but it's still good because it's compelling. It's not an ordinary superhero movie. It's a drama fantasy movie with true depth. The storytelling made it more interesting. ""Thor"" has more magic than superhero action. It can be one of the best superhero movies although it isn't really loyal to its superhero movie elements. ""Thor"" is pretty unique to its genre and it's a good Kenneth Branagh film.","

"feelinesound","28 April 2011","Honestly, seeing that Branagh directed and J. Michael Straczynski wrote the script is a large part of why I went to see the movie. Plus I'm generally a big fan of Marvel and their movies.Unfortunately it's one of the dumbest things I've seen in years, and is completely full of moronic clichÃ©s and the most superficial faux morals. Please do yourself a favour and spend your money on things that are more deserving of it, especially if you've worked hard to earn it.Just in case you want to know what you'll be missing ---* spoiler alert * (though really I'm giving this film a massive compliment by suggesting you could 'spoil' anything in it)Thor's father takes his hammer away and sends him to earth for punishment. While there Thor literally changes overnight from being an arrogant, rash and violent idiot to a wise, humble and pacifist purveyor of all things noble, and the only possible reason for this that's presented in the movie is that he met Natalie Portman and was then told that his father died while he was gone. Once Thor the god of thunder completes this astonishing and instant transformation and sacrifices his life for others, his hammer flies back to him, revives him and he beats the bad guys with it.If you really, really love Marvel movies and viking folklore (to the point where you don't mind these things being made a joke out of) and have 2.5 hours in which you'd otherwise be causing harm to humanity or this planet, go see it. Otherwise you might as well spare yourself from this glorious waste of time and brain cells.","

Nothing in this genre since LOTR has been any better. Everyone involved in the production should be proud to know that their movie can stand toe-to-toe with the likes of anything else that summer can throw at them.They found the perfect combination of spectacle and guts and passion balanced with the human dynamic of the character. It delivers mind-bending visuals but it still very intelligent and thrilling. How many summer films can you say that about that you've seen over the past ten years or so???? The actors REALLY brought the characters to life. It was really amazing to see it develop on the big screen. There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a star in the making and a rather astounding leading man. Thor is a dazzling example of the superhero movie done right. There were some parts in the movie where I was just blown away. This film has a depth that no one could have expected and is very impressive in scale and design.I love how the movie played out and it exceeded all my expectations. This was by far the adventure movie I've seen in years. Not too many movies continue to have character growth from start to finish but still pack in the action and heart.","

"John_T_Chance","26 April 2011","Another outstanding effort, Marvel does it again! It's hard to believe that a movie with this subject matter can make you think and challenge all your movie viewing skills but it does so and more. It's very artistic and you would expect no less from Kenneth Branagh. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would've thought. The pacing was perfect as is the link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can't wait to see what Captain America brings us. Overall, a summer movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen in years.The director's background in Shakespearian themes comes in to play right from the beginning of the film and run throughout. Thor is a super-strong ""god"" and can travel through space with supernatural powers yet the story is paradoxical and contrary about those elements instead choosing to focus on the human elements. THAT elevates this film far beyond anything I was expecting but I should have known better considering the source material and the director.The genuine and relatable qualities of these characters are what make it a great film. Sure, the action and fantasy are incredible but the story works so well. The family dynamics between fathers & sons along with sibling rivalry and the price of vanity and lack of humility all resonate. The choices made and the relationships on display are as wonderful as the brawling and action... which are as good as any summer movie that I've seen in years.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","21 April 2011","This MARVEL movie was satisfactory. It had humor, action and family complications. It did seem annoying at the start though. Instantly you can see that Asguard was based off the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz and a little later, any Star Wars geek or cinema geek who sees this movie will instantly notice a scene at the start of Thor that is a total clone of the ending scene in A New Hope.Besides the clichÃ©d start it turned out to be a good movie. It didn't feel like a MARVEL movie, but a fantasy epic that tried it's best. Me, I'm personally looking forward to Green Lantern after this one, also Captain America and Tin Tin: the Secret of the Unicorn at Christmas.I recommend Thor to anybody who's a fan of fun, comics, eye candy or just MARVEL comic fans in general will love this movie. For those of you who think this will suck, watch this and see how wrong you were.","

"gigan-92","11 May 2011","D+ I'm not much of a Thor fan to begin with, but I was not against the project and was rather intrigued by it. The casting choices seemed very spot on, myself being particularly excited by the presence of Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman. Kudos to Idris Elba as well. However, the film opens with the annoying character played by Kat Dennings. Not only that but Portman's character was one I was completely unable to connect with. Then we go to Asgard and the visuals as expected are stunning. The lighting and wide range of colors was well done and all around beautiful. The mythology was very engaging and the choice of Tom Hiddleston as Loki was a damn good one. The elite ""Warriors Three"" look great from a distance but do little to nothing in the movie. There is not a single reason for me to go into them what so ever due to their lack of screen time and the fact that the majority of the time they were on screen the director treated them as over-redundant comic relief. The Ice Giants were very imposing and served well as antagonists. The battle with them was one of the film's few saving graces.Then Thor is banished to our realm, Earth, and so begins the painful midsection of the film. And this I mind you is the longest section of the movie. The dialogue is corny and the script struggles to find any bit of memorable dialogue and character development. For the longest time I forgot I was watching a superhero flick and instead a badly staged comedy/sitcom. The director refused to take the material seriously at all, even as far as having S.H.I.E.L.D. agents poke fun at the Asgardian warriors as they stroll down the street and then smother the window of a restaurant like lost dogs. And the vast majority of the humor wasn't funny sadly. This wasn't ""Iron Man"" with its smart and quippy dialogue, this was so clichÃ© it hurt to watch. Denning's character comment s on how hot Thor is, a predictable and very corny romance starts that just grated on my nerves throughout. None of the protagonists seem to take their roles seriously, which would be okay if this were a straight comedy. The villains are menacing enough but don't get enough screen time. I know I keep comparing it to the Iron Man films, but the way the comedy and action are spliced together only shows how badly director Kenneth Branagh tried to make a sh*t-stained copy of those films. I found myself yawning more than anything.Destroyer was awesome in my opinion, making even further jokes out of the ""Warriors three"" without a fight at all. By the time Thor gets his hammer back I was beyond bored, and in usual Marvel fashion the writers try to throw a curve ball concerning the main villain and it's a decent one I'll admit but the end battle is too short to be breath-taking. In short there are a few colorful shots and nice monsters, but this is outweighed by corny dialogue, cheesy humor and story development that redefine boredom. I cannot recommend this my fellow fans.","

"darkmax","1 May 2011","Thor has always been one of my personal favorite among mythology. A warrior with a heart of gold, forever tormented by Loki the trickster and magician. Thus, Thor became one of the very first comics I've ever continually subscribed to, for an extended period of time. However, the stories in the series became kind of stale in the 90s, and so I stopped after much disappointment.The recent revival was great but I'm already over my addiction.This movie is very well made with plenty of strengths and little weaknesses found in so many comic adaptations. I watched the 2D version as I still can't stand 3D for all that hype about nothing.1. The cast is a strong one with strong character-actors, even among those with less important roles.2. CGI is realistic and not over the top. I just wish they would have made the Frost Giants' world less of a twilight zone.3. Loki was a great character. Instead of portraying him as the standard evil villain, he was made into a sad and jealous antagonist.4. Costumes and equipments were very well made, especially the armors and weapons. Will there be a life-size replica of Mjolnir? Why do they call it a hammer, when it is obviously a mallet? 5. Wasn't Sif supposed to have long golden locks?.....","

"tomgillespie2002","7 May 2011","As Marvel's mega-budget Avengers film draws ever closer, the stand-alone origin films are slowly coming to an end. Only Captain America, starring Chris Evans, remains to be released. So Thor arrives, amidst a worry that a portrait of the God of Thunder arriving on Earth after being banished from his kingdom in the sky may look a bit silly, especially when played by actors rather than drawings in a comic-book. But Marvel's track record has been good so far, and even very good, in the case of the first Iron Man film. Their left-wing choices for both actors and directors, and bold decisions have made for interesting viewing, and it's no different here.King of Asgard, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), sits proud on his throne after defeating the Frost Giants of Jotumheim and bringing peace to the Nine Realms. He has two strong warrior sons, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), one of which will eventually succeed him. But when Asgard is breached by Frost Giants trying to take back their precious Casket of Ancient Winters, seized by Odin, Thor invades Jotumheim with a small band of warriors including Loki, and starts a new war. Odin, livid with Thor's defiance, banishes him to Earth and takes away his all- powerful hammer Mjolnir, deeming him unworthy. When he arrives on Earth, confused and powerless, he is taken in by a scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), while Mjolnir sits in the desert, moulded to a rock, awaiting the touch of someone worthy of it. Meanwhile, back on Asgard, war is afoot and Odin lies near-death, while Loki starts to act suspiciously.This may all seem ridiculous and silly, and it is. The opening ten minutes, which condenses the history of Asgard and its war with the Frost Giants, is a confusing and silly blur of CGI and narration. My hopes of another Marvel triumph were somewhat dashed, but thankfully, with the arrival of Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and a bit of character development, the film started to become the enjoyable romp that it is.Marvel's choice for Thor, Chris Hemsworth, whose CV consisted of a main character in Australian soap Home And Away, and a cameo as Captain Kirk's dad in the Star Trek reboot, is a stroke of genius. He has the charm, acting chops, comic timing, the physical presence to actually convince as a God. He was born to play this role, it seems. He juggles between irresponsible, immature and arrogant in the first half, to show off his skills as an action hero you can truly root for in the second. And when the film calls for him to play the fool, he pulls that off too.The choice for Kenneth Branagh to take the directing reigns was a strange one. A director who is most at home directing literature, namely Shakespeare, would not have been my first choice to direct a blockbuster that could easily go tits-up if mishandled. Yet Branagh handles the duties with a natural flair and confidence. The film goes back and forth from Thor's growing humanity on Earth and his relationship with Portman, to Loki's evil plotting on Asgard without ever losing focus of the story at hand or the large collection of characters.Overall, this is just a fun film, never taking itself too seriously, yet always maintaining a respect for the source material. The undoubted star to emerge from the film is Hemsworth, who I'm sure will go on to have a successful career. I'll be looking forward to see his character again in the Avengers film, which arrives sometime in 2012. Special mention should also go to Tom Hiddleston, who arrives from the London stage after winning several awards to play a menacing and pleasingly complex villain.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","

"ossie85","7 April 2023","I have to admit that I will always have a soft spot for Thor. This is in part due to the outstanding performances of the cast, especially Tom Hiddleston as the mischievous Loki.Director Kenneth Branagh brought his Shakespearean background to play with this movie, and it shows in some of the dialogue and dramatic scenes. The story also does a great job of bringing the world of Asgard to life and giving it a unique visual style.One of the major highlights of Thor is the scene-stealing performance of Idris Elba as Heimdall, the gatekeeper of Asgard. His commanding presence and gravitas bring a sense of seriousness to the movie that is sometimes lacking in Marvel films.All in all, Thor is a fun and engaging superhero movie that introduces one of Marvel's most iconic characters to a wider audience. While it may have some flaws, the strong performances and unique visual style make it a movie that I would recommend to any Marvel fan.","

"gavin6942","12 May 2012","The powerful but arrogant warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard and sent to live amongst humans on Earth, where he soon becomes one of their finest defenders.I have enjoyed Thor as a supporting and humorous character in the past -- both in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" and one of the early Hulk movies. But I was never convinced he could be the leading character... his story is a strange one outside of Norse mythology.But here, I think it worked. For me, the biggest concern is how do you reconcile Thor being a god with the other gods of the world? For Christians, there is only one god, so calling Thor a god calls everything into question (in the Marvel Universe). But they made it work here by strongly suggesting he is not, in fact, a god, but was merely seen as one by the old Norse people because his strength was so superior to theirs. Nice save.","

"TheUnseenMovieLover","26 April 2011","Wow. That was the first thing I thought after seeing Thor. I'd read the strong reviews, I loved the choice of Kenneth Branagh as director and the trailers looked great. But I still wasn't prepared for how satisfying this movie would be. This is the very definition of epic, and I LOVED it.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a God of Norse mythology, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and brother of Loki (Tom Hiddleston). When Thor disobeys his father and sparks an ancient war with the Frost Giants, Odin banishes him from the realm of Asgard and casts him down to Earth. With the help of a trio of humans (including Natalie Portman's Jane), Thor struggles to fit in on Earth whilst looking for a way to return to Asgard. Meanwhile, the devious Loki plots for his father's throneÂ…Simply put, Thor is the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight. The idea of Norse gods and warriors who dress, sound and look like pompous Vikings (some of whom interact with modern humans), multiple universes, rainbow bridges and Frost Giants must have seemed pretty hard to pull off without being silly, especially when this hero eventually has to meet with more ""realistic"" superheroes such as Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America in next year's The Avengers movie. But Branagh has taken something potentially camp and cheesy and turned it into a powerful, strangely relatable story; there are quite a few Shakespearian elements in Thor's story, something which Branagh is an undeniable master at adapting to the screen. Plus, Branagh and the screenwriters also inject a much-needed humour into the proceedings without unbalancing the emotion and surprising seriousness of the story. The most impressive thing about Thor is the way it treads a pitch-perfect line between respecting the material and winking at its audience knowingly (most notably with a certain cameo). In that way, it's reminiscent of The Mask of Zorro, never taking itself too seriously whilst never allowing itself to slip into parody. Branagh also proves to be a master at creating an epic summer blockbuster. Apart from a few dodgy moments, the visual effects are stunning; in fact, this is probably the most visually impressive film I have seen from Marvel thus far. The production design is also beautiful; Asgard is one of the most incredible movie landscapes I have ever seen. My eyes were stretched to breaking point, trying to drink in all the details of this new, exciting and opulent world. There are some moments which look a bit fake (which is annoying when the filmmakers had about $150 million to work with), but it's almost forgivable based on how spectacular the majority of the visual FX shots are. Credit must go to the FX and art direction departments. But a summer blockbuster wouldn't be a summer blockbuster without action, and Thor delivers some great sequences. The early encounters with the Frost Giants (genuinely frightening creatures) are superb, with Thor and his friends using some pretty bad-ass moves. A later scene where Thor fights to retrieve his mystical hammer, Mjolnir, is gritty and intense, whilst another great set-piece sees the metallic being known as The Destroyer hunting Thor and destroying most of a desert town in the process. I have heard that many people consider the final confrontation to be anti-climactic, but I have to say that it isn't as much about seeing epic action is it is about seeing how the main characters have grown and changed throughout the course of the film. In a way, I think that displays the film's greatest strength. It isn't all about the action and the visual effects; it's more about the characters and the emotional response.Speaking of which, the cast is exceptional. No pay cheque grabbing here; every cast member dives into their role headfirst. Let's start with the big guy himself, Thor. Hemsworth is best known for his brilliant, five- minute appearance as Kirk Sr. in 2009's Star Trek; to go from that to the lead in arguably one of Marvel's most risky undertakings could be seen as a huge step. You wouldn't know it from watching Hemsworth's performance, though. He is absolutely perfect in the role, charting Thor's journey from an impetuous fighter to a more understanding, wiser man with ease. Comedy, action, drama, romance; all encompassed perfectly in Hemsworth's performance. He deserves to achieve stardom after this, and I'm really looking forward to seeing how he fits into The Avengers. Natalie Portman is charming and charismatic as Jane; the scenes between her and Hemsworth ooze chemistry, whilst her scenes with Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings, terrific as Jane's mentor and intern respectively, shine with a wonderful camaraderie. Hiddleston steals the movie whenever he appears as the slithering, manipulative yet oddly sympathetic Loki; this is a wonderfully complex role, and Hiddleston never strikes a wrong note. Hopkins, instead of hamming it up, brings powerful gravitas to Odin; he is intimidating, yet wise and weary from his many years of experience. The scenes between him, Hemsworth and Hiddleston are tremendous, each actor bringing all of their talent to bear and succeeding beyond all expectations. There are too many other names to mention, but rest assured everyone's sublime.Apart from some minor quibbles, I absolutely loved this movie. Branagh, the cast and crew have succeeded beyond my wildest dreams. This encompasses everything I want from an epic adventure; action, wonder, romance, comedy and a surprising amount of character and intelligence. In my opinion, this is one of Marvel's best, taking something which could have sunk to the lows of Ghost Rider or Elektra and propelling it to the same heights as Spider-Man 1 & 2, X2 and Iron Man. Add a great pre-credits teaser for The Avengers (plus one exciting appearance from a minor member), and I couldn't be more hyped. You're up next, Captain America; don't you dare let the team down.","

"neil-476","30 April 2011","This was big daft fun. After a short sequence where Natalie Portman and her fellow scientists drive into this chap in the middle of an unexplained whirlwind, there is a lengthy sequence in Asgard. Asgard looks great (the Rainbow Bridge is phenomenal), the Norse Gods are all played well, and the action elements are beautifully done. Then Thor is cast down to Earth, powerless, to teach him a lesson, at which point a) things start to go pear-shaped in Asgard, and b) the goings-on on Earth are somewhat less engaging than those in Asgard, although there is some very well-judged comedy. But the last half hour or more is action all the way, both on Earth and in Asgard.I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, as did my companions (one of whom is far from a committed comics movie fan), and took pleasure in the way further elements are included to set up the Avengers movie - again, don't leave until after the credits. There are places where what you see on the screen screams ""Kirby!"" If I was to offer any criticisms, I would say: 1. There is a point where the pace drops somewhat about half an hour in; 2. There is quite a lot of it which reminded me of other movie (the small town battle reminded me of similar sequences in both Superman II and Supergirl); 3. Rene Russo is wasted. I imagine she features strongly in ""Deleted Scenes."" Natalie Portman never really convinced me. Kat Dennings was fun but underused. Idris Elba was a great Heimdall. Anthony Hopkins added an immeasurable amount of class as Odin - a strong ruler, absolutely assured as to his authority, but calm and compassionate when appropriate.But Chris Hemsworth is the big discovery here. His Thor is as nuanced as Chris Reeves' Superman/Clark Kent. A wonderfully enjoyable performance in a film which is non-stop entertainment.","

"cre8toruk","9 May 2011","Sorry, to all that have given this ""movie"" more than 1 out of 10. This has to be one of the most sorry excuses for a movie I've ever seen. Actually less interesting and more poorly written than Pokemon the movie and even that was a new low for me... It cost me Â£10.00 to see this (I had my own 3d glasses)!!! I'm considering asking for a refund.What was the point of Natalie Portman or the other mortals presence and the 5 minutes we spent in their company?This movie is nothing but a 2 and bit hour long trailer for the undoubted THOR 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 which will have all the drama and normally good content that Marvel based movies have (I can only hope).More time is spent (nearly half) developing characters and giving us background information on how we've got to where we've got...rather than telling the story that we paid to see....There's no depth of character, (Anthony Hopkins was the best actor in it and he spent most of his time in a coma, I'm guessing after he read the script !), there's no plot other than arrogant son, exiled to earth. He spends 5 minutes (yes 5 !) not understanding anything that's going on or how society works (despite him and his people being deified for at least 2,000 years) and then gets sucked back to his own ""realm"", there's little in the way of good dialogue, the special effects are Dr Who'esq and the 3D is forgettable.There's no menace from any of the baddies, his ""bad"" half / non brother seems so nice that you think ""ah it's all an act and something terrible is going to happen""... but no, he is quite a nice guy only really dabbles with naughtiness.....This film was supposed to be in 3D yet I completely forgot that it was after the first 5 minutes and only at the end when I realised that I was wearing the stupid glasses did I remember!!In a time where we have transformers, X-Men and the like, the special effects were weak and pretty poor. There's no humour no camping it up to rescue it either.My worry is that if this is the best movie of the undoubted quadruology that we're about to be subjected to, then God help us. I warn you we may have another Iron Man 2 (a movie I still haven't been able to stay awake all the way through yet!!) or Spiderman (anything other than 1) on our hands and can I bring myself to part with another Â£10 on the strength of that?... almost certainly not.This could and should have been great, it wasn't and I'm left feeling cheated !

"Eternality","29 April 2011","Where Michel Gondry, the acclaimed director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Be Kind Rewind (2008), had comically failed with The Green Hornet (2011), Kenneth Branagh, the respected director of Henry V (1989) and Hamlet (1996) succeeded with Thor. An extremely promising setup to Joss Whedon's The Avengers, which is slated for release in the summer of 2012, Thor is without any doubt the best film Marvel Studios has produced in recent years, even better than the Iron Man (2008, 2010) series, I'd reckon. In fact, one has to go back to Sam Raimi's Spiderman (2002) for any decent comparison with the quality of Branagh's work here.Any dissonance felt since Branagh was picked to helm Thor would have slowly evaporated in the first thirty minutes of the film. After all, it is a bold and risky move for someone who is known for brilliantly translating the theatrics and subtleties of Shakespeare's words into film form to challenge himself with a big-budget superhero movie meant for a popcorn-munching audience. Speaking of which, Thor is imbued with Shakespearean undertones of betrayal, sacrifice, and tensions among the hierarchical ruling family. Branagh brings a touch of humanistic, real- world sensibility to the fantastical setting, enlivening the film when it could have been dulled with flat visual effects.The story takes time to build up, and that effort is worth it, as it immerses viewers into three realms, that of Earth, Asgard (where Thor and his father, Odin, live), and Jotunheim (where the villains, the Frost Giants, live). The settings in each of these three realms play an important role as they give viewers the chance to visualize and juxtapose the worlds of these ""mythical"" characters. Action sequences fought in Asgard and especially Jotunheim, are well-directed with visual and sound effects becoming the main draw, appeasing Marvel fans who will get numerous opportunities to see Thor (and his oh-my-gosh-I-so-want- that-hammer) in action.In contrast, what happens on Earth is ordinary. But it remains to be the realm that provides the film with its most hilarious situations, and a romantic subplot involving the newly-crowned swan queen Natalie Portman, who plays Jane Foster. Thor is played by Chris Hemsworth, who as a new face to Hollywood, is surprisingly charismatic as an actor. Perhaps his charm plays out from his character, who from a brave but arrogant royal prince of Asgard becomes a lost soul on Earth, where he is banished to by his father (Anthony Hopkins) for inciting war with the Frost Giants.For a film that sees itself as a serious take on the Marvel universe, it is quite funny. The most laugh-out-loud moment occurs during a brief conversation between Thor and a pet store owner. Another milks humor from an Iron Man reference. Other moments take advantage of the ""earthly"" situations Thor find himself unable to adapt to. On a random note, I would advise Marvel fans to stay all the way till the end of the end credits for a snippet of what is to come in The Avengers.Thor, under the hands of Branagh, is an excellent example of how to do a superhero movie right. It has all the necessary elements that make a successful Hollywood blockbuster. By no means a great film, but it certainly aspires to be so. And for that and other reasons mentioned above, I shall lavish praise and give a recommendation.GRADE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)(www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com)All rights reserved.","

"velvoofell","28 April 2011","There is a poignant scene in cult 1980s BBC sitcom 'Red Dwarf' where the super-organised hologram Rimmer talks about why he actually likes his polar opposite Rastafarian, slob, scouse room-mate Lister. He compares him to a hangover-cure ""fried egg and chilli sauce ciabatta sandwich"" Lister has offered. ""All your ingredients are wrong - but somehow it works, somehow you're right!""The same has to be said for 'Thor'. A giant WWE escapee taking down scientists and CIA men in New Mexico just after having been banished from his monster-infested, operatically armoured home-universe sounds like the worst straight to video Triple-H starrer ever made - but it all somehow, not only comes together, succeeds in throwing more at the screen than many superhero movies could lay claim to.Marvel's vision and slight tinkering of the Norse Edda, the mythological testament of the vikings, remains. Loki is Thor, not Odin's, half-brother, while Heimdall, usually the janitor of the Gods in mythology books, becomes a noble and stoic guardian of the godly kingdom of Asgard.Kenneth Branagh resurrects the one thing that was good about his 'Frankenstein' - sweeping camera shots, heated melodrama that evokes the excitement of a children's story as well as the drama of Shakespeare. In fact, Branagh's grounding in the bard means that the plot's interweaving of 'King Lear' in Odin, 'Macbeth' and 'Iago' in Loki's character, of 'Hamlet'-llite in some of Thor's darker ruminations and not a little of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' s immortal/mortal interpersonal dynamics is deft.Thrilling and refreshing too is the involvement of monsters, giants and archaic robot menaces as well as real-world threat and suspense in a superhero movie for almost the first time in the cycle of superhero movies since 'X-Men's' rekindling of the genre. Bryan Singer might want to take notes if he ever revisited 'the Man of Steel', while Zach Snyder might do well to notice that human drama need not be sacrificed in the face of a slew of special effects.There are only a few negatives. Once Thor lands in the desolate New Mexican town and finds friends he just kind of hangs with them there. Moving from place to place may have heightened the thrills in the earthbound sequences. The prosthetics of the Frost giants look off-the-peg creations compared to their giant CGI hell-hound-troll and this may come from two different effects houses handling these respectively.These are minor quibbles in a movie that blends humour, whimsy and outrageous action with genuine urgency, real world dilemmas and not a little goose-pimpling Shakespearean cinema. Oh, and the brief glimpse of Odin's steed Sleipnir shall have comic-book and mythology fans in a state of complete awe.This will satisfy everyone who attends it and all that remains to be said is this to the developers of the new 'He-Man' movie: Look at 'Thor' - it can be done.","

"SteveMierzejewski","10 September 2011","If you are looking for a wall to wall action film, you will be disappointed with Thor. Not that there were not action scenes, but, they are few and do not take up much film time.If you are looking for a Spiderman-like romance angle for the main character, you have also come to the wrong place. The reason for this, and much of the reason why the film didn't work for me, can be summed up in two words: Natalie Portman. My guess is she took the film for money. She seemed like an actress who showed up on set simply to recite her lines. You can get better acting from a tree stump. Thus, it is difficult to believe that the super hero, no matter how great a nature worshiper he may be, could fall in love with a tree stump. I would have been much happier to see Thor's love interest played by a complete unknown. This would have worked.The story is slow to develop as much time is taken to set the scene. Eventually, the action moves to earth and it is here that the film livens up. Personally, I wish the entire movie took place on earth. I dreaded returning to the dull life on Asgard. On the other hand, the special effects for this realm are really quite good.Certainly, the highlight of the film was the acting by Chris Hemsworth. He played the confused, serious, laughable hero angle to perfection. It's too bad he had to work with Portman. Better luck next time.","

"ChadFeldheimer","19 April 2011","Okay, so Thor is pretty darn decent. Phew. Without revealing anything regarding the plot, I'll just say that I enjoyed this film quite a lot, and would rate it above both Iron Man films, but not by too much. (If you hated them maybe just stay away from Marvel movies in general?) Very good in all areas, without achieving greatness in any sums up this movie nicely I think. Beautiful costumes and set design, solid acting all around, and much better action than recent movies have offered up. The world of Asgard has been handled wonderfully, looking absolutely gorgeous, and with all of its denizens very well spoken without their dialogue ever being as obtuse or clunky as Thor's 'Ye Olde' English has been known to be in the past. Special mention to Idris Elba for being friggin' awesome. I'm a pretty big Marvel fan, but not knowing what Mjolnir is won't harm your enjoyment of Thor to any great degree I don't think. Also, side note, I personally dislike 3D with a great, burning passion (thank you Clash of the Titans), but it is relatively well done here, never distracting from the film. I would still recommend seeing it in 2D if you can though, as it is quite dark in parts. Several parts. Bring on the Avengers!","

"big_ryan15","27 April 2011","I have to admit, i had low expectations for this adaptation. Hulk yeah sure, Iron man, why not, Captain America, its set in the real word of course it'll work. But THOR? A wildly fantastical tale of Norse Gods and Rainbow bridges and nicknamed hammers ?? Surely not! Ill stop with the bashing; this film is astonishing. The oddest thing has happened here. Coupling notoriously artsy director Kenneth Branagh with one of Marvels most theatrical characters was a stroke of genius. At the beginning of the film, we are quickly introduced to Jane Foster, her whimsical offsider and an older gentleman. Storm chasers aren't normally this clever you might think to yourself during this opening scene, but alas, they are revealed to actually be physicists after a few minutes. An incredible storm arrives and THOR HAS LANDED: or so you would think. Mere moments after being introduced to our title character we are thrust on an astrological journey to Asgard, land of gods. Here we are introduced to Odin, the all father and his 2 young boys; Loki and Thor. Odin recites stories of an ancient war in which a planet load of frost giants planned to destroy the realm of Midgard (earth) before Odin and his merry men stepped in to save humanity. It is during this scene we are first shown Thor's arrogance and thirst for war. Skip ahead a few years and THOR has become Asgard's mightiest warrior, just as Odin had foretold. A celebration is occurring, Thor is about to be crowned as king of Asgard, but alas... this glorious day is interrupted by none other than said FrostGiants attempting to steal a stolen heirloom from Asgard's weapons locker.. The story rapidly gains traction from here. Thor marches into the Frost Giants planet (against his fathers will) in all his Aussie glory, kicking ass and taking names. He and his friends become swiftly over powered and Odin is left no choice but to step in. An argument erupts in which Odin tells Thor of his assholness and douchebaggery and that he is no longer worthy of his giant hammer Mjolnir or his god of Thunder status. Cast down to Earth the audience is reunited with the opening scene and we are officially filled in. A bevy of comedic scenes follow in which Chris hemsworth's THOR is tranquillised and run over multiple times. The film transitions backwards and forwards between our world and that of Asgard so as to keep us informed on going ons. Odin goes into a coma and Thor's mischievous bro Loki starts to come into his own. A marvellous story unfolds filled with action, humour, heartache and a whole heap of awesome!! Branagh's eye for curious shots is on full show here and works fabulously in creating a beautifully surreal Asgard. The films close is a little rushed but is also very heartfelt and strong. Leaving plenty of room for more character development, THOR is as good as if not better than every comic film to date, the characters were superbly cast and played and the story follows as close as it can to the source material as it can without being too over the top. Spectacularly fun movie, worthy of the Marvel name tag and certainly a sequel. 10 out of 10 for performance and entertainment....Make sure to stay after the credits for the Captain America nod.","

"Sergeant_Tibbs","10 July 2013","The only reason I watched this film is because I'm going to see The Avengers soon and I've seen all the others, although they range from decent to average. I was already not a fan of anything about this film so I had low expectations and it pretty much met them. I'm not a fan of Kenneth Branagh in whatever he does so Thor was pretty typical of him. The emotional cores of the film are intended to be the father/son, brother/brother and Thor/Natalie Portman relationships, but none of them were convincing as they weren't set up properly, nor did they have any genuine chemistry, as a poor attempt to base them on Shakespearean foundations.Loki is a ridiculous villain, he wasn't evil nor threatening, and I immediately hated the character of Thor. Every character is paper-thin and charmless, I had lots of eye-rolling moments. Especially as they set up the realm of Asgard to be a sincere and the Earth scenes to have lighter comedy, the contrast only seeming sloppy and cheap, as they repeat the same jokes four times in a row hoping to get one laugh. There's no tension or excitement, as the unlikeable Thor battles faceless obstacles, it's no better than a Steven Seagal movie but made PG-13. The other Avenger films had something redeeming about them, but I'll see how the big film is on the big screen. I don't expect something spectacular, but at least worthwhile.3/10Update: I saw The Avengers and it was spectacular. I am pleased.","

"tedg","22 June 2011","I continue to maintain that the least imaginative and cinematically effective production group is not Michael Bay's, Jerry Bruckheimer's, or that gleeful combination of Ron Howard and Brian Grazer. It is Marvel, who time after time think a hard punch is an effective punch, color is the same as effect and shout equals passion. Their use of the visual art of cinema is roundly uncinematic, just as Shanghai is profoundly dumb architecturally and for the same reason.They know this, and also know that their films may not be remembered kindly - affecting aftermarket sales. Of all the entertainment businesses, Marvel knows that markets change and the real moneymakers are those that can be sold into new media pockets.So what do they do? Well, I have seen two Marvels this summer. With the latest X, they decided to add some story for a change.But here they tried another tack, and it is worth noting. The dramatic world of Marvel is Greek with teen angst added in and everything taken to excess. There clearly was a market for that. But since the production of the films is so tightly controlled and homogeneous, to sell more tickets, you need a differentiator. The angst and volume is already stretched as far as they know how, so why not stretch the dramatic center from Sophoclesto Shakespeare. So bring in Branagh and allow him to populate the thing with actors who can appear 'Shakespearean.'It is less important that we actually witness Shakspeare, the folds, introspections and narrative loops, than we think we do, we get stentorian presence. No one is going to deride Anthony Hopkins for this, because he is a lost cause among serious actors. But the real tragedy is Ms Portman, who with SkarsgÃ¥rd can really act and who knows how to support a vision like Kenneth would have for his 'Hamlet.' But that is not his job here. His job is to take loud things and give them the smell of Shakespeare.Natalie, like her character, can only watch in horror as this is visited on her, and disaster is grown.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","

"moviewizguy","7 May 2011","The epic adventure THOR spans the Marvel Universe from present day Earth to the mystical realm of Asgard. At the center of the story is The Mighty Thor, a powerful but arrogant warrior whose reckless actions reignite an ancient war. As a result, Thor is banished to Earth where he is forced to live among humans. When the most dangerous villain of his world sends its darkest forces to invade Earth, Thor learns what it takes to be a true hero. (C) Paramount PicturesTHOR is a mediocre superhero flick. It opens with a shaky 10 minute beginning that introduces the mythology of THOR in a fast pace with exposition-esque dialogue. Here, you can see one of the main problems of the film: The scenes in Asgard are waaay too serious. So serious, in fact, that you might find yourself laughing unintentionally at the damn cheesy lines that are being said by the actors with a straight face. Fortunately, most of the film takes place on Earth, where it DOESN'T take itself too seriously. This is good because the film is actually really funny when it needs to be. This is mostly due to the whole ""fish out of water"" aspect of the film with Thor being banished on Earth. He acts the same way as he does on Asgard, and that is what makes it funny.Saying that, you might feel that there were two directors working on this film because of the completely different tones between the settings on Asgard and Earth. Since THOR jumps between the two settings now and again, you feel like it's doing a juggling act to try to balance the serious and laid back parts of the film. I can't say the film maintained it too well since I just couldn't take the Asgard scenes seriously. And those partly to blame is on the actors themselves.For starters, I didn't think Chris Hemsworth had enough in him to play the serious side of his character. Every time he tried, I had to hold the laugh waiting to burst out within me. As an actor in general, I think Hemsworth is great. He CAN do serious, as seen in A PERFECT GETAWAY and the opening of STAR TREK (2009). It's just that he couldn't do it here. Tom Hiddleston is a bit better, but I felt that he sometimes played his character more over-the-top than it needed to be. I can't say many good things about Anthony Hopkins either. I felt like he just wanted a paycheck. However, I did like Idris Elba. He played his serious character without being too laughable.The ""human"" actors, on the other hand, are better. As much as I love Natalie Portman, I didn't think she did much here. She seemed to just go through the motions with nothing spectacular to do in particular. Even her chemistry with Hemsworth didn't seem convincing enough. Kat Dennings' character, on the other hand, might be my favorite. She provides some of the films biggest laughs, and it's obvious her character is in the film to only provide comedic relief. Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd was pretty good too, but he doesn't get to show much range.As for the action in THOR, I must say that I was pretty disappointed. Apart from the opening action sequence in Jotunheim, the majority of the action scenes were pretty middling and incomprehensible. Even the scene with the Destroyer seems to be a rip-off of Klaatu from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (2008). I just felt the film had too much CGI and not enough practical effects to make the action scenes memorable or exciting enough. I guess I was spoiled with the fresh and exciting action scenes in FAST FIVE the week before. Overall, I found THOR to be mildly enjoyable mostly because of the scenes on Earth. It's not the worst superhero flick, but it's not THE DARK KNIGHT either. It's just ""there."" Once the credits roll, you'll forget mostly everything about it. 5.5/10","

"davish_wulf-1","2 May 2011","I must be honest, my hopes for this movie were very low. The trailer wasn't very appealing and to capture Thor's comic magic was quite a challenge. Gladly i was mistaken, the movie is a great introduction to the asgardian hero and i was kept entertained from beginning to the end.Balanced action that moves back and forward between Asgard and Midgard. Sadly 3D doesn't make the movie better, on the contrary. I sincerely hope 3D is reserved for pure animation movies... that's right... leave ""pure"" cinema alone.Chris Hemsworth played the perfect Thor (after being bitten by zillions of steroid ""bees"" to bulk up for the part)Hopkins plays Odin very well, wise, mysterious and powerful like the god of gods should be.Was impressed with Tom Hiddleston has Loki, moving from a friendly innocent role to a mischievous, dark character (just like it was in the norse Myths).Portman did her part, strangely looking very young compared to some other roles, but Chris/Tom lead the play here.Using a color actor for Heimdall (Idris Elba) was a very odd move, considering we're talking about norse gods. Surprisingly it worked very well, since Heimdall is the guardian of Bitfrost and he messes up with magic portals, the dark skin gives him that arcane-wise looks.Can't say the same about the Asian actor (Asano) who is COMPLETELY out of place here, with his strange accent and looks... one of the reasons i don't give 10 out of 10. Actually, i find Thor's friends (apart from Loki) a bit of the ""weird bunch"", lacking charisma and presence in the movie (and with the Asian guy, lacking on the norse department).Asgard was well portrayed, CGI all the way... but comparing with the comics, Asgard is a very stylish version of a norse ""olympium"".Action sequences were great and so was the humor. Many times i found myself laughing my behind off to some viking style behavior.Don't want to spoil it for you, but if you know the comics style, you will actually feel like inside them sometimes, with all that cosmic atmosphere around the fight sequences - colorful, mysterious, out of this world.The only last fault i can mention was me wanting for more... and isn't that a good thing for a first movie?Bring on Thor 2!!! Odin be praised!","

"hallmitchell","22 April 2011","Coming into this movie and seeing the previews. I thought this movie would be comic book movie 101.This is a lot better than that.Superb casting, directing, costumes and sets.This movie is a fantasy and comic book film rolled into one.Think MARVEL meeting up with a LORD OF THE RINGS type fantasy film.It's a great story, there is a splattering of well timed humor. The support acting is great.I couldn't think of a better way to kick off the THOR films than with this one.Please get everyone involved with this back again.And remember stay to the end credit scenes.The CGI is fantastic and not over used. They've used miniatures to.Great work team MARVEL.","

"lekgolah","2 May 2011","With The Avengers in the horizon, there is reason to doubt whether this will be Iron Man or Iron Man 2 where its development was rushed so that Stark would be ready to team up with the likes of Hawkeye and Hulk. However through Kenneth Branagh's directing he is successful in making an enjoyable action film about the God of thunder.In an interview Kenneth Branagh said that Thor is similar to Shakespeare because of the family conflicts. The script itself may not be Shakespeare but you can draw some similarities. It is in these moments of conflict between father (Antony Hopkins) and son (Chris Hemsworth) where the film shines. While the filmmakers did their best to make the Earth scenes interesting, they do not hold up well to the scenes on Thor's home planet.Thor is a visually spectacular film with amazing CGI. Some say that it is becoming over used in films today but this film uses it with care. There are no moments where the CGI would drop below par. Like the film it remains consistent throughout.The acting that includes many recognisable faces, is very good. Chris Hemsworth as Thor handles the character well as does his brother in the film played by Tom Hiddleston. Anthony Hopkins and Idris Elba are also really good. Natalie Portman, while also good, is never given any dialogue to help project herself above romantic interest sadly.While you might not really care for the romantic sub-plot until the end, the film packs a punch, delivering solid action sequences. Unlike Iron Man 2, this left me interested in seeing what happens next in The Avengers.","

"DonFishies","30 April 2011","When Marvel announced its intentions to create a film based on The Avengers, most fanboys cheered with delight. I remain to be incredibly interested in what the company and Joss Whedon have in store for us next summer, but in the interim we have Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger to look forward to. While every new image and trailer has kept me excited for Cap's entrance, I have always remained skeptical on Thor. The trailers did nothing to help my hesitation going into the film, and after watching it, I am even more apprehensive Marvel's future plans.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a ridiculously powerful god living in the ""realm"" of Asgard. He is due to be crowned king by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), but during his commencement, Asgard is briefly invaded by rogue members of the Frost Giants, a group who hold a long standing truce with Asgard. After acting out recklessly and endangering the lives of his warrior companions, Odin strips Thor of his godly powers and his hammer Mjolnir and exiles him to Earth. As he searches for hammer, Thor ends up in the care of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a scientist studying wormholes, constellations and the causes for certain spatial phenomena.I find it incredibly difficult to go even further trying to describe Thor. The ending is ridiculously obvious moments after the film begins, and the proceeding moments make no attempt at trying to do something outside of playing by-the-numbers. Origins are vaguely discussed, and there is such little emphasis on character development and explanation that you wonder why Marvel even bothered giving the character his own film in the first place. The best part of the film is the initial introduction to Thor, Asgard and the powers possessed by these godly warriors. Everything past his exile feels secondary and almost useless.One of these reasons is the simple fact that Thor's journey on Earth is not interesting in the slightest. It is the battles, the characters, the settings on Asgard that offer the most fascinating, engaging and enjoyable scenes in the entire film. The film has a habit of jumping back and forth between what is occurring on Asgard as Thor treks on Earth. Almost every time, I found myself more focused watching those scenes that keep jumping in, and was ridiculously bored by everything else. I figured these scenes would be the most satisfying parts of the film, but never figured they would make me totally oblivious of everything else that was happening.But I digress, because it seems like the plotting and story existed only because Marvel needed some time to show Thor off to anyone who does read comics on a regular basis. He is the character with the most ""development"" in the film and his role in the film is defined merely to tease how he comes on S.H.E.I.L.D.'s radar and becomes a part of The Avengers. Hell, they even go so far to only give us small dialogue exchanges, a few nods and two awesome cameos as they build towards that film (unlike Iron Man 2, whose second half revolves almost entirely around increasing audience awareness), and spend the rest of the time trying to tell us who Thor is. I appreciated less emphasis on Avenger lore, but considering Thor is not an incredibly exciting character, that appreciation can only go so far. Special effects wise, the film is a mixed bag. Many of the scenes on Asgard are simply astounding to watch. They are truly breathtaking, and provide one of the only reasons anyone should bother watching the film. But a lot of the fight scenes are the exact opposite. They move too fast, are hard to see, and are almost cartoonish in nature. I know Thor and his warrior compatriots exist in a place of pure fantasy, but that does not mean everything has to look so preposterous. The 3D adds to a few of these scenes and makes them infinitely more impressive. But at the same time, it also helps mask how terribly composed a lot of them are as well. Hemsworth as Thor is one of the other small amount of reasons to see the film. He is built like a tank, and has a powerful aura about himself. He easily embodies the character's superhuman abilities with ease, and makes something as silly as waving a hammer look ridiculously bad-ass. He transcends the role, and stays strong throughout, whether playing the character as an arrogant and pompous warrior, or a meek and mostly powerless stranger. He has a lot of fun with the role, but he never forsakes or even attempts to not take the role deadly serious. Sadly, much like the interchangeable story, the majority of the supporting cast simply does not match up to the power of Hemsworth's performance. Portman, fresh off her Oscar win, is supposed to be a brilliant scientist. But one look at Thor, and she is thrown into a giggling schoolgirl like trance that she is unable to shake for the entire film. Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd is decent, but he does nothing outside of answer a few questions and hint at future developments. Kat Dennings exists solely for comedic purposes. Hopkins and Idris Elba are two stand outs, but they are so horrendously underplayed that it is practically criminal. I was actually really impressed by Tom Hiddleston's performance as Thor's brother Loki and Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson of S.H.E.I.L.D. But sadly, they can only do so much in light of being overshadowed. While there is quite a bit to enjoy about Thor, there is way too much to dislike. It had potential to be something great even with what it has working against it, but it sadly just never makes anything for itself. It exists merely to help Marvel fit an agenda. And Kenneth Branagh seriously directed this? You could have fooled me.6/10.","

"smlubecki","20 July 2011","When I heard they were making a movie of the character Thor I had serious trepidations. When I heard that Kenneth Branagh was directing it I had even more trepidation not due to the fact that it was Branagh but the fact that all he's ever directed was drama's.Going into the theater I very low expectations from this film and man was I blown away. I like the fact that Branagh didn't approach the story as a super-hero film but more of a Shakespearing epic. The fantasy elements alone were marvelous.Anthony Hopkins IS Odin...I cannot imaging another actor portraying him. His performance as Odin captures the essence of the character and the delicate balance of ruler verses father. He exudes power with subtle touches of vulnerability.Chris Hemsworth is outstanding as Thor. He's got such a likability about him that even at Thor's most arrogant point in the story you can see how his friends stand by him. His performance is rock solid and extremely enjoyable. Tom Hiddleston is THE perfect Loki. He's captured the sleazy, slimy, be nice to your face but looking for a place to drive the knife in your back nature of the character.As I had stated earlier the story plays out as more of a fantasy epic than a dyed in the wool super-hero story. The journey into Jotenheim was stunning and Asgard itself was just beautiful to behold. The set designs were excellent. The humor in the film was very organic and never seemed forced. The story itself was very well balanced and didn't leave you wondering what the heck was going on. I almost wish they'd have kept it separate from the upcoming Marvel films. It works very well as a stand alone epic.The effect's that I was expecting to be sub-standard were in fact top notch and even Thors trademark spinning hammer from the comics didn't look as cheesy as it could have. This movie is a gem. All parties involved should be proud of themselves for bringing such a great piece of work to the screen. I for one cannot wait to see a sequel to this film. With any luck we'll see some of the other nine realms such as Muspelheim, Alfheim or even Vanaheim.This is definitely a MUST SEE film","

After being thrilled by Iron Man (2008) ,I was interested to find that Kenneth Branagh was moving from Shakespeare to the Comic-Book. Leading to me picking up a hammer and going to see Thor make his thunderous big screen debut.View on the film:Along with Hugh Jackman and Robert Downey Jr in their CBM's, Chris Hemsworth shows that he is a perfect fit for this role,with Chris being able to do the amazing fight scenes, (which help to display the intense level of training that Hemsworth put himself through for the role) and the more dramatic/light-hearted scenes where Hemsworth shows Thor slowly transform,from a self-centre,blood thirsty warrior,into a warrior that is (beginning) to understand the art of war.After losing her mind for her Oscar winning performance for Black Swan,Natalie Portman really lets her hair down for this role,with a light breezy performance.Although she sadly does not get the chance to participate in the stunning fight scenes,Portman still does a very entertaining performance,with the many scenes she shares with Chris Hemsworth brilliantly catching the natural chemistry they have with each other,which also helps to reveal a different side to Thor.Whilst the story,which is co-written by J. Michael Stracznski (who has a very funny cameo) is not as complex as his astonishing screenplay to the 2008 film Changeling,Kenneth Branagh unveils a unexpected relish for taking on this vast canvas.For the action scenes Branagh executes them brilliantly,with the first battle on the planet of Jotunheim being a true thrill-ride,with the mix of hand (or hammer) to hand combat,blending in seamlessly with the CGI created warriors and monsters. During the opening of the film,Branagh shows a unexpected J.R.R Tolkien side for this film,with the world of Thor being given a stunningly beautiful,epic scope.For the sections of the film which take place on Asgard,Kenneth Branagh unwraps the world he is creating,with fantastic sweeping shots,that help to turn this film into a very epic adventure.Final view on the film:A gripping,action/adventure comic-book film,with a fantastic performance from Hemsworth,and unexpectedly stunning action scenes from Branagh.","

"harry_tk_yung","29 April 2011","There's no stopping â€“ the Marvel family is coming. You probably recall seeing a glimpse of Thor's hammer a couple of years ago in the closing credit of ""Iron Man 2"", with Agent Coulson from Iron Man puzzling over it. Many realized immediately that it was Marvel family advertising. This time, there is more promised, a lot more, as we get glimpses of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in upcoming ""The Avengers"" which brings back the old, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), as well as more of the new â€“ Captain America (Chris Evans). What a party for 2012! But let's not stray too far from the present, Thor. As stated in the summary line, this movie offers an exceptionally coherent story. It's something like this, very roughly. Between the two most mighty of the nine ""realms"", Asgard and Jotunheim, a truce is about to be broken as a result of conspiracy and treachery. At the same time, in Asgard, with King Odin's two sons Thor and Loki just about ready to succeed him, a Boromir-Faramir syndrome (refer: Lord of the Rings) intensifies (but with a twist later). When against Odin's order Thor leads his favourite gang of warriors, Sif the Amazon and the ""Warriors Three"" (Volstagg, Hogun, Fandral) to attack Jotunheim (and what an action sequence!) he is banished to Earth (one of the nine ""realms"") where he encounters lovely scientific researcher Jane Foster and her fatherly mentor Erik Selvug. His banishment comes with the creator a huge crater in New Mexico and an Excalibur-like phenomenon that is his hammer (the aforementioned sneak preview). Agent Coulson is of course sent out to investigate. Meanwhile things are happening in both Asgard and Jotunheim. Revealing more specific details will be a disservice to the enjoyment of the movie, even with spoiler warnings. In general terms, I would say that on Earth, the stranger-in-a-strange-land development is somewhat predictable yet enjoyable to follow. In the mythical realms, the plot of double-double-double-crossing is surprisingly believable.My summary line has also made reference to the extraordinary cast. For the titular role, little know Chris Hemsworth is well cast, so there's no need to clamour for Brad Pitt. After ""Black Swan"", it's simple pleasure to see Natalie Portman in a more normal role of Jane Foster (actually a good role also for a young Jodi Foster). Anthony Hopkins as King Odin is natural, and the same can almost be said for Stellan Skarsgard as Erik Selvig. A majority of IMDb users in the IMDb discussion boards pick Tom Hiddleston's Loki as their favourite character and I can understand why. My own favourite actor (all-time) Canada's own Colm Feore nails King Laufey of Jotunheim, even behind the hideous mask of a makeup. Jaimie Alexander's cool beauty as Sif leave an impression even though this character is not depicted as Thor's love interest as in some of the published material. Tadanobu Asano, sometime referred to as ""Japan's Johnny Depp"", adds an exotic touch to the film as Hogun. Even though it's almost a cameo appearance, it's good to see as Frigga (Odin's queen) Rene Russo who have not had any major appearance for over a decade, since the remake of ""The Thomas Crown affair"". Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson you'll see a lot more of in future Marvel family releases. There is one question that everybody has been asking: why Kenneth Branagh? What made him interested in directing a 3D comic book adapted action flick? But does it really matter. What we have is a product that in among the best lately in this genre.","

"Treyroo","24 November 2012","The film opens in a realm and/or planet far removed from Earth and human existence. We're given a brief overview of the major events in its history and then we're introduced to its royal family battlefield conqueror, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth). After disobeying his father, Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) he is banished to Earth and stripped of his godlike abilities. Enter Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). While studying anomalous events in the atmosphere under the guidance of her mentor Erik Selwig (Stellan Skarsgard) and with the not- so-able assistance of Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), she bears witness to Thor's banishment or rather the tornado-like occurrence that made it possible. This intrigues Foster and after a brief period of reticence she hopes to offer help to Thor and, at the same time, elicit any information he might have that could help her in her work. All the while, turmoil in Thor's realm could potentially destroy both it and Earth. I'd not seen Hemsworth before and while the part requires very little beyond physicality, he is adequate at least. The ""earthlings"", are good enough as are those from Thor's home planet and the story is about what I expect. It's not amazing, it's not awful. Basically, it's just a good time at the movies.","

"Vartiainen","25 August 2013","Thor was always the hardest to introduce into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While the rest of the Avengers are all human, albeit some with superpowers, Thor, the mythological god of thunder, is anything but. Keeping that in mind, I think this was an excellent adaptation of the comic book superhero that we know and love. It has its flaws, and if you were to write the whole Avengers storyline from a scratch, you'd probably give a character like Thor a miss, but the film makers managed to make it work.What I like the most about this film is its charm. This stems from the great actor choices, as well as the writing and the dialogues. Chris Hemsworth was a new face for me personally, but I don't think that they could have picked a better Thor. The man has it all, the looks, the attitude, the physical prowess, the charisma. Natalia Portman and Tom Hiddleston are equally great in their roles of Jane Foster and Loki, respectively. The writing, on the other hand, shines through in the dialogues, which are fun to follow and feel real. Hemsworth has some really great lines throughout the entire film, which cause me to laugh out loud no matter how many times I see this film.In addition, the rest of the cast do excellent job as well, the visuals (especially the design of Asgard) are topnotch and the action scenes are creative and fun to follow.Unfortunately the movie falters a bit when it comes to the pacing. Most of the first half of the film is spent in Asgard, introducing the world and building up the characters. And while this is all needed and I enjoyed all of it, it causes the time spent on Earth to feel just a little bit rushed, especially the budding romance between Thor and Foster. So perhaps a little more time should have been focused on Earth rather than the various alien worlds, but even as it it, it doesn't ruin the film. There are some things that could have benefited from extra attention (Odin sleep, anyone?), but only the romance really feels like it should have had more time to develop. Otherwise you can buy the fact that the film can only be so long.Aside from that one flaw, I really think that this is a great film. The characters, the visuals, the plot, they all work and they work well. Marvel can proudly call this one its own and it's a worthy introductory film for the character of Thor.","

"Pumpkin_Man","10 May 2011","I've seen this awesome movie twice so far, and it keeps getting better!Thor took me by surprise and has now become one of my favorite Marvel Comic movies! There is never a dull moment, and is filled with action, comedy, suspense and Norse Mythology. The city of Asgard is beautiful. Chris Hemsworth was perfect for the role as Thor! Thor is about to become King of Asgard, until Frost Giants ruin the ceremony. When Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront the leader, Odin takes away Thor's powers and sends him to Earth, where he comes across a beautiful scientist named Jane Foster. 50 miles away from the town is Thor's mighty hammer, Mjolnir, which no one can pick up. Until Thor becomes worthy, he won't be able to pick up his hammer.Back on Asgard, Loki becomes the new King, and sends the Destroyer to Earth to kill Thor. Will Thor be able to save the town without his powers? If you want an awesomely epic superhero movie, you'll love THOR!!!","

"Marvelouis","3 May 2011","WOW! No wonder all the big time critics love this movie (Ebert, Roeper, Joyce Kulhawik. etc) It's amazing! I can't wait to see it again! Two thumbs up from me too! Thor is a magnificent thrill ride that even the most cynical viewer or critic will find something to enjoy. That's why even the jaded or cynical critics wanting to hate on yet ""another comic book film"" can't bring themselves to hate it. Those watching with an open mind will absolutely adore this film. Once seen, it's easy to see why critics are basically in agreement regardless of their previous dispossession.If you're going to turn a comic book into a movie, do it with utter belief in your story and do it with the best talent and FX possible. That's why Marvel rules the cinema and why they need to get ALL their properties back under their roof. Come on Disney, spend that cash and reunite the Marvel Universe! Avengers will be great but imagine if Spider-Man and Wolverine pop in to join Thor and company in Avengers 4!!!!!! Yet, Even in an era when an explosion of comic-book properties are hitting the big screen, Thor stands alone. This has little to do with an individual who utilizes special powers and everything to do with your typical Marvel hero. It's the classic Marvel style with a great twist, a hero with flaws and awesome spectacles everywhere you look. You must see this flick!","

"Meven_Stoffat","26 May 2011","Honestly... just WOW. I saw this a few weeks ago and I'm still shaking from what an incredible movie it was. I tried many times to review it but I gave up each time because I was afraid words wouldn't do the film justice... and now that I've had a bit of time to digest the movie, I guess I can write a review now. I was stoked about this movie right from the get go. I am a fan of The Avengers, and have seen pretty much every movie that has led up to the upcoming Avengers movie. OK, The Incredible Hulk was tedious and forgettable, but looking past that, I enjoyed Iron man I and II, and when I heard Thor was being made, my excitement level was turned up to 11. Not to mention Captain America is coming this summer, and I am extremely stoked for that movie. Thor is more of an origin movie than anything else, really- we learn of Thor's past on Asgard, and how he was cast out for disrespecting Odin's Honour, and relieved of his powers with the Hammer. We then go to earth, where a group of scientists have found him, study him, and in a way, try to protect him from a rival research group, who have set up an expedition centre surrounding the hammer. Furthermore, Odin is dying, and in this respect, Thor's brother Loki has been handed the throne, thus creating a potential conflict between Earth and Asgard. Not many people knew of Thor- Thor was a b-list hero in his day, as was Iron Man. But I feel that thanks to this movie, Thor will become the new Iron Man, and it will develop a cult following of its own someday. Kenneth Branagh takes the director's chair here, and manages to produce a very theatrical, Shakespearian production. There's even tilted camera shots in this, which gives it a cool 90s Flash vibe. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as Thor, and has adapted his humorous and quirky mannerisms well. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Odin as well, and Natalie Portman hams it up- in a good way of course, Portman is an incredible actress and really knows how to carry a film. If I had one complaint, it's the 3D. I would strongly advise against seeing it in 3D- it wasn't filmed in 3D to begin with, it was converted in post. There are a few pretty Asgard shots worthy of the 3D treatment but just a handful of shots isn't enough. It looked flat, and darkened the look of the film. That being said, this movie is a clear reminder of why we go to the cinema. Branagh has given us a fantastic adaptation of Thor, and has gotten me excited for Captain America and The Avengers. Oh, there's a Jeremy Renner cameo as Hawkeye, and stay through the credits for a great teaser for The Avengers!!! OVERALL: 10/10 PROS: -Great acting -One of the best scripts of 2011 -Awesome cinematography -Thrilling Action -Movie is appropriately paced, allowing equal amounts of action and character development CONS: -See it in 2D. 98% of the film's shots are unworthy of 3D. There is no depth in the 3D and it looks terribly dull.","

"RhyanScorpioRhys","8 May 2011","Hmmm, ThorÂ… where do I begin? I have long since given up the erroneous notion that superhero movies should be true to its comic book counterparts. I also have lived long enough to see superhero titles rebooted so often that they bear no r...resemblance to their origins as told in my youth (Jane Foster is an astrophysicist stormchaser?) So, I entered Thor with absolutely no expectations. Good thing, too, because if I had any, they wouldn't have been met. First, I must agree with Sir Anthony Hopkins and state that there is far to much CGI in this film and not enough character development. There were opportunities to delve into characters and their back stories that were simply ignored.Other problems include: Fight scenes that played out like video game ads, with actors trying to strike the right ""badass"" pose for the cool action shots. Annoyingly silly humor that wore thin quickly. Conflicts that were one-dimensional and built no real suspense. A forced love story. And I understand that even a god of thunder must have a character arc, and Thor's was a common one that I could have overlookedÂ… had it been better acted, and yes, better directed.The whole movie lacked gravitas. Plain and simple.There are some that have said it's nothing more than a two-hour preview for the upcoming Avengers movie and I can't totally disagree with that. But it is not the worst superhero movie ever made (far from it), it is simply the weakest Avengers prequel movie made to date (and yes, I'm including Iron Man 2 in that category).Who knows? Check your brain at the door and you might just enjoy this special episode of ""Donald's Creek.""","

"jan_kalina","29 April 2011","Surprisingly Thor has got the magic of an amazing, popcorn overflowing, comic-book movie. I have to say I was quite sceptical about this movie, the footage in the trailers looked pretty lame and stupid, but the great reviews I kept reading about this movie made me change my mind to go and see the movie.When I read that Kenneth Brannagh is directing Thor I had no idea what to think about it, I mean a renowned Shakespearean director and actor at the helm of a high-budget comic book movie? It just didn't seem like a good idea, but I didn't believe that Jon Favreau could pull off a good movie with Iron Man and he proved us wrong and so does Brannagh. It seems that Marvel has got good hand on picking the directors. The character of Thor is a tricky one to translate to screen. Firstly Thor isn't like other superheroes, he isn't human, he is a God, one who was worshiped by ancient Norsemen. The story might be simple but that doesn't matter if it's well told. Thor is cast down to Earth by his father Odin for his reckless actions that reignite an ancient war and is forced to live among humans. Thor is one of the most charismatic, arrogant, noble, physically imposing, powerful and romantic characters that have come on screen recently. Chris Hemsworth brings all that into the character so he proves himself as a great actor. Brannagh handles the action scenes very well. A guy huge like a mountain fighting his enemies with a hammer sounds silly but it looks great on screen. Hell, it actually kicks ass. The action is exactly how I expect it from a comic book movie: it's cheesy, little bit over the top, fun and kick ass. Brannagh was chosen for this movie for another reason, he knows that in a summer movie the action can't be simply there just for the sake of having action scenes in a movie. You need emotions and he delivers that through almost Shakespearean family tragedy. Anthony Hopkins as Odin is amazing, when he shouts ""Silence"" nobody ,even in the cinema, says a word. Tom Hiddleston gives here an incredible performance as Thor's devious brother Loki, who is scheming against everyone, hidden under this facade of a meek. Natalie Portman as a beautiful young scientist hasn't got much to do in this movie just to be amazed by Thor and you can see that she really is. When he kisses her hand as a noble man you can see how she is falling for him in love. I love how the writers incorporated S.H.I.E.L.D. into the story in such a casual way. Once again we get the marvelous Agent Coulson. His interactions with Thor are the funniest and also the most tense one. Idris Elba as Heimdall the guard is a perfect casting choice. He is calm, great in action scenes. He is just perfect. There is also Rene Russo as Thor's mother Frigga but unfortunately she doesn't get a lot of screen time.In the end this is exactly what you pay for and even more. Thor is one of the greatest comic book adaptations, it's funny, has great characters and actors,great score/soundtrack by Patrick Doyle, amazing visual effects, great action scenes. In my opinion it's a comic book movie the way they are supposed to be made.Watch out for a great Stan Lee's cameo and as usual with Marvel movies stay till the end of the credits for a genius post-credits scene.Thor will return in The Avengers.","

"blacklist-1","27 April 2011","WARNING: VOAF (Very Overrated Audience Film) has struck cinema in the form of Thor with a over-bloated 7.9 IMDb rating in what has been described as an ""epic"" superhero film. The only epic thing about Thor is what a bore it was and where I felt myself drifting towards sleep halfway through. Seriously looking on here I shook my head with disbelief at the statistical ratings of nearly 40 per cent of ten out of ten and written reviews of a no less given rating of four (apart from one reviewer). The thing is I have to be honest with how I felt about this movie. I won't go into the plot really because other people on here have already given a synopsis and I can't be asked to waste my time writing one. Sufficed to say the story is very simplistic with no real twists and has all the usual clichÃ©s of the ""bad brother"" and the ""damsel in distress"" falling for the ""hero."" But hey this is not really much of a criticism as there are plenty of films out there that follow the same formula, but at least they were enjoyable like Spiderman or the Batman films, the old or new ones.What I will say that I did enjoy with this film, which stopped me giving this a turkey and ultimately becoming as worse as the truly dreadful I Am Number Four is the special effects, which I have to say were quite impressive. Some of the scenery was breathtaking, the 3D in certain scenes was well implemented and Anthony Hopkins gave a great performance. However these small positives are drowned into oblivion by the scale of terrible things about Thor. First off the rest of the performances are terrible across the board. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was ridiculously bad and just sounded like he wanted to be elsewhere. He might look the part in costume but he cannot act and didn't convince me for a second as the hero. This wasn't helped by the script, which made his character stupid (at first) but then he supposedly redeems himself. But for me he was just annoying as you don't come to care about him or any of the other characters. Tom Hiddleston as Thor's brother Loki carried no weight as the villain as he just sounded so dull and my Natalie Portman! She seems to have lost her brain since her extraordinary performance in Black Swan. She gives the most cringe-worthy and wooden performance out of the whole cast. She laughs like a hyena and smiles like a retarded idiot and I just wanted to slap her as she goes all luvy dubby eyed over Thor (what does she see in him!? There is no romantic chemistry between her and him whatsoever). All the other cast are just as bad in under-performing and again wishing like they were somewhere else and who could blame them with such a bad script. It carried no emotional weight or substance and was just dry and repetitive. All the characters are essentially cardboard cut outs with no depth (though some of the reviewers say there is!) so I didn't care about them. When Thor in one scene is supposedly killed, I kept wishing it would come true but it dosen't. There is very little action and even when there is the Michael Bay trait appears with you hardly being able to see what is happening because the camera is so close up with lack of continuity editing. Furthermore the 3D itself though impressively implemented in a few scenes was mostly bad. I could actually at certain points take off my 3D glasses and see where it was in 2D as there was no distorted image. It's as though Kenneth Branagh the director decided after a while he couldn't be asked to properly implement the entire film in 3D and thought ""well the audience won't notice."" Well he hasn't fooled me. If he thinks audiences are that gullible in that respect when it comes to poor 3D he's wrong. What makes me laugh though is that he in an interview said he added the comedy moments to make sure audiences didn't take the film seriously, but the comedy wasn't funny and the whole film literally had the tone of trying to be serious, which I think is part of it's big downfall for me. The scene where you think Thor dies and there is sad music is just for me sickeningly insincere. (A similar scene to one in I Am Number Four).When it comes down to it is that Thor is just another Hollywood glossy movie that pitches itself as delivering everything (but for most audience viewers it has) but really delivers nothing. Hollywood has duped us all and they should be ashamed of themselves. If you want to waste Â£7.80 or more if you see it in the evening or weekend on this travesty of a film, don't say I didn't warn you. You watch it as your own peril. The only saving grace surely for how awful this film is will be bought to light by the film critics when reviewed this Friday, which will hopefully help counterbalance the very overrated opinions of Thor from audience reviewers on here.","

"TheLittleSongbird","3 September 2011","I was interested in seeing this ever since it came out. After finally seeing it I am so glad I did. It is a visually stunning film with excellent cinematography and editing and the costumes, settings and effects look wonderful. There may be the odd longueur in the plot, with a little too much of admiring the scenery, but most of it is amusing and while not sticking true to the original source material there are a lot of nods to it. Kenneth Branagh directs superbly, the action is earth-shattering and the script is filled with witty fish-out-of-water moments. The acting is fine with Chris Hemsworth giving his all in the role, Anthony Hopkins bringing some welcome gravitas to Odin rather than hamming up, Natalie Portman more than a pretty face and Tom Hiddleston's Loki a villain worth watching for. All in all, an immensely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"thekyles99","10 May 2011","Although having originally balked at director Kenneth Branagh for casting Chris Hemsworth in the lead of this film, i have to say i was presently pleased with the job he did in this. Now as you will see in this version Chris Hemsworth is ribbed and cut however I was hoping he would've used a wrestler such as the likes of Paul (Triple H) Levesque he's way more massive in the body building sense then Hemsworth is. Im sure however that Hemsworth is a better actor. Needless to say the film rocked and turned out to be one of the better comic book adaptations i have seen to date. Branagh carefully handpicked his cast in this with the end product proving this immensely. After being cast out of his mystical city of Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor is sent to earth with his famed hammer. He is befriended by scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and with her team they follow Thor as he treks to find his hammer. Upon finding the mystical and powerful weapon he cannot seem to pull it from its place embedded in earth. This leads him and his friendly band of scientists to find out as to why he has come to earth and deemed powerless. It takes a powerful Asgardian foe that comes down to earth to destroy Thor and with malicious intent to do more harm then good to earth's mortal citizens, to give Thor what he needs to conquer and rejoin his father as a King in Asgard! Kenneth Branagh in his first comic book super hero genre type film did a superb job in retelling what is one of my favourite heroes that the great Stan Lee crafted in his comic book series. Seeing Thor only left me craving to see 2012's The Avengers that will be directed by Joss Whedon.","

"haydenluz","23 January 2021","Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, had some cool ideas coming into the film, but due to a weak back story, and poor execution of the characters and script, this film ended up being decently boring compared to some of the other films we've seen in phase one. Branagh brought his Shakespearian style to Thor, that worked for better and for worse. He utilized a few decent sweeping scenery shots, but the over abundance of dutch angles, really threw me off. Just like most of the other phase one films, Thor had some production issues, hiring, firing, and rehiring castings, while swapping through directors like it was going out of style. After all the smoke was cleared, they casted great talent, and a good director.Thor had a good amount of potential to be at least decent, but it simply felt like another set up film. With such a poor fish out of water story, the expositions were left underdeveloped and dry, while the tones are completely uneven. The first half hour is pretty good, seeming to be setting up for something interesting, but come the rest of the eighty minutes, it dragged at such a slow pace, relying on the characters to drive the film, and that just didn't work in this application.From a stand-alone film prospective, Thor probably has the most talented cast, selected by Sarah Finn and Randi Hiller; all the team needed to do was make a good script, to compliment the characters, and they couldn't do it. Most of these characters are pretty disposable, lacking charm, wit, humor, and overall likability. Chris Hemsworth seems like he was made for this role. At first, he was denied the role of Thor, but he tried out again, and solidified his casting. Hemsworth does bring a lot of charm and good comedic timing to the character, but he can overcook it at times, making Thor a little more over the top than usual. With such a powerful hero, it's hard to make a solo film for him because he is just so strong, that the risks just won't be there, and that's the risk Kenneth Branagh wanted to take, and it didn't quite pay off. Branagh tried to give him a character arch, but it was just so clichÃ©, setting up for a predictable third act. Natalie Portman is such a talented actress, but she is one of the worst love intrests of the MCU, solely because the relationship with Thor is so laughably forced and underdeveloped. Her character is just so boring, I couldn't invest myself into her. Tom Hiddleston puts on the best performance of the film, as Loki, having a good motive, and great emotional connection with Thor. He sold all of his emotions seamlessly, making everything he did and say, feel genuine. I was honestly pretty excited to hear that Anthony Hopkins was going to be in this film, not just as a side character, but as Odin! Other than him trying his best, with great delivery, he basically just hung around the whole time, while Thor and Loki got all the best lines.The action really wasn't all that present, nor memorable at that. The only halfway decent action sequence there was, was the first battle; other than that, the action was just ehh, being a massive downfall considering the power of Thor.The film has a pretty weird production scale. Asgard was ginormous, with all these vibrant colors that pop all over the screen, but when it came to when they were on earth, the small town looked way too much like a movie set, being so dull and boring.Overall, it's like salt in an open wound to say that I didn't really like this movie. It had it's moments here and there, but there was nothing that stood out to make this film stand out on it's own, and hold it's value.","

"cadillac20","6 May 2011","When I first started seeing trailers for Thor, I was fairly unimpressed. I worried that the fantasy elements would be treated poorly and that this was really just a cash in to set things up for The Avengers. However, good buzz about the film prompted me to see it, and sure enough, the buzz is right. This is an entertaining summer blockbuster that continues the trend of early summer films from Fast Five.A bit different from the other Marvel films, this one concerns a different take on the Norse myth where Thor is the brash, blood lusting, and proud son of Odin. He is soon sent to Earth and relinquished of his godly powers in order to be taught a lesson. However, forces conspire against him and his home, Asgard. Certainly, there is heavy tie in here with the rest of the Marvel universe of films, but the film establishes itself as something different. Where as most other Marvel films have been grounded in reality with all the flashiness and powers mixing with everyday life, Thor generally keeps the film's fantasy and reality separate. In fact, for once in a Marvel movie, people question how these things are happening. It is in this fantasy element that Thor separates itself. It's story is heavily invested in it's mythology, and that is a welcome change of pace. This is, for the most part, a fantasy film, with magic and powers and even the silly costumes.The film is led by some strong performances, most notably in the three main actors of Hemsworth, Hiddleston, and veteran thespian Hopkins. Each delivers strong, with Hemsworth and Hiddleston stealing the show and providing some very good drama and character growth. Natalie Portman and the rest of the supporting cast to a great job as well, with Portman acting her usual adorable self while appearing to have a lot of fun in the role, which helps make her performance that much more enjoyable. Branagh does an admirable job as a director here, showing a flair for the dramatic and making good use of the source material in it's scale and scope.There is surprisingly not as much action as I expected, but there is also a lot more humor than I anticipated, especially when Thor first comes to earth. My only major complaints against the film are it's seeming lack of focus and the romance angle. There doesn't seem to really be a straight focus here as the film shifts between several different groups doing things all at once. There is an overall quest of Thor to learn from his predicament, however, it really lacks a lead up to a climax. Even when Thor does head into the finale, it's underwhelming and it sort of just happens. The human drama and characterizations make up for some of this, but, none the less, it comes off as a bit of just passing through the motions. The second is the supposed romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's character. It's simply not believable that Thor would just fall for the first beautiful woman he see when he gets to Earth. Her attraction to him is more understandable, but any actual love is hardly believable.These two things, however, as minor in the face of the grand spectacle. With great fx, great performances from the cast, and a snappy pace, this is a great way to start the summer blockbuster season and brings hope that rest of the Marvel films coming will follow suit and be just as good. Here's looking at you First Class and Cap. Am.","

"Norway1","28 April 2011","Although an avid Marvel comics reader I never once read Thor comic book. I was hooked on X-Men, Avengers, Spider-Man, Alpha Flight and others, but for some reason Thor never interested me much. So when this movie was announced I wasn't all too interested. The trailers weren't much help, though they perked my interest. A few good television spots and the final trailer convinced me to give it a try. So yesterday I took my 3 teenage kids to see it on opening night here in Oslo, Norway at (allegedly) the biggest screen in Europe.I was effing blown away! Maybe because I wasn't expecting much. Or maybe because it was a great film. I like to think it was great.Remove your biases and (even if you didn't like the trailers) if you loved the first Iron Man movie you will LOVE this!Personally, I didn't much like Iron Man 2, didn't like either of the Fantastic Four movies but loved Iron Man 1 and all the X-Men, Spider-Man and (Nolan) Batman movies. (Just for your comparison with taste.)Only word of caution/advice is to see it in 2D if possible. We watched it in 3D and though the 3D was pretty good (comparable with Green Hornet if you've seen that) it made several of the scenes blurry. Our projectionist said it was because the theater is so big and the screen is too far from the projector for this particular movie to work in 3D, but that others (Avatar, any animated movie, etc) work just fine in that theater. So either watch it in 2D or on a medium or small screen in 3D.","

"Aaron1375","9 May 2011","I saw this film when it first came out in 2011 at the theater. Back then I thought it was a rather good origin story and I still believe that. This film is another in a string of films that led to the Avengers that would come out the following year. This one would introduce us to Marvel's Thor, the Asgardian who is the god of thunder and wielder of the mighty hammer. It would also introduce us to the villain Loki, the master of deceit and trickster. Like Iron Man 2, we would also get another hero in Hawkeye; however, unlike the Black Widow's rather substantial role in Iron Man 2 where she even got a battle scene, Hawkeye is in the film only momentarily and we never get to see him do his thing. The film is an origin story which pretty much has to clue us in to the background, but it does deliver a good action scene fairly soon, though the middle of the film really does not have much in the way of Thor action going on. At this point Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 had been released and I have to say I enjoyed all three a bit more than this one. Granted, The Incredible Hulk just about does not even fit in anymore thanks to Norton declining the role further.The story has a group of scientist led by Jane played by Natalie Portman trying to determine what is exactly going on with the sky. There is an event and they end up hitting a man in the midst of it. Then the film flashes back as Odin (Anthony Hopkins) tells his two sons Thor and Loki of the realms and how the Asgardians came to the aide of Earth as they battled the Frost Giants. Years later, Thor is about to become king; however, the celebration is ruined when some Frost Giants enter the castle. Enraged, Thor goes behind his father back to the realm of the Frost Giants and picks a fight. Odin finds out and banishes his son to Earth, stripped of his powers and this is where he is hit by Jane and her crew. The hammer also is sent to Earth and a lot of people try to move it and make a game of it before S.H.I.E.L.D shows up and sets a perimeter. Thor tries to reclaim his hammer, but finds out he is now unable to lift it. Loki, meanwhile learns of his origin and assumes the throne when Odin falls into Odinsleep. He then devises a plan to take out his brother so that he may never return to Asgard.The cast is rather good as Chris Hemsworth does a great job as Thor and Tom Hiddleston is even better as Loki. His character is good too, as you just never know what he is thinking as his motivations are not cut and dry. Natalie Portman just seems a bit out of place in this world of superheros though. She does alright, but I thought the girl who played Darcy was a lot cuter and had more spunk. Anthony Hopkins is good, but he generally is even when he is in a really bad movie.So, this film was good and a good introduction to the character of Thor and his realm. Could have used a bit more action, but they always seem to cap the action a bit too much in comic book movies always relying on a romantic subplot to pad the film a bit. Mad Max: Fury Road is an excellent example of a film that did not slow the film down to have a bunch of scenes of looking into each others eyes and such. I would have also liked to have seen Hawkeye do something other than draw his bow back, he has not really shined as much as others in this series seeming to be just a good archer. He has a few more skills than just that. Granted, the only real target here was Thor so I guess they could not have him put an arrow through the hero of the film's head. Overall, it was good, but I thought the sequel was better.","

"NORTHPOINTMJM","14 June 2011","Now everyone can see why they cast Hemsworth. He's perfect because he certainly fits the part physically but, more importantly, he's able to play Thor both as a mighty pompous loose canon as well as being a big lovable ""god out of water"" unable to adjust to human ways. Both are absolutely crucial to the character winning audiences over, especially those who may not be familiar with the character from comics. Hemsworth and the script does this with style. I also love the texture of this film. Example: The power struggle within Asgard between Thor and his brother and Thor and his father, Odin. It feels very relatable and very passionate. Their passion and rivalry was something anyone can absolutely relate to in their own lives.No wonder all the big time critics love this movie (Travers, Roeper, Joyce, Maltese, etc) It's amazing! I can't wait to see it again! Thor is a magnificent thrill ride that even the most cynical viewer or critic will realize delivers a fantastic and fantastical reason to make the trip to the cinema. That's why even the jaded or cynical critics wanting to hate on yet ""another comic book film"" can't bring themselves to hate it. Those watching with an open mind will absolutely adore this film. Once seen, it's easy to see why critics are basically in agreement regardless of their previous dispossession. As good of a summer movie that's been released in years.","

I admit I went to the movie thinking ""Why did they not cast that viking from 13th Warrior?"", ""Why are they going for the cute guy instead of making Thor really scary and north like?!"". The reason: Hollywood is getting stupider with every film. No more suspense, no more nothing. Money, money, money.... See this movie once and then never again. The acting is awful, Natalie Portman is done making good movies and I feel so bad that Anthony Hopkins really involved his name in this movie. P.S.: Thor's hammer looks like it's made of plastic, same as Green Goblins plastic outfit from Spider Man 1.","

"RCWjr","7 May 2011","Thor was a risk to bring to the summer multiplexes. Lets face it, there is a lot to cram into a 2hr film, especially one that is built for the summer crowd. But Branagh is able to mix equal parts Asgard gravitas and earth levity to make a film that is thoroughly enjoyable.Most of the praise should go to Chris Hemsworth who wields the hammer with all the confidence in the world. He was one of the few actors that was in both ""rhelms"" and he was able to give Thor the right amount gravitas and levity when it was required. Sir Anthony Hopkins is the perfect Oden. Tom Hiddleston has garnered considerable attention for Loki, and I agree he is good. But the supporting actor/character I was most surprised by was Natalie Portman's Jan Foster. This is probably the first role I have seen her in where I got the sense she was totally at ease and having a blast. I expected her to just kind of walk through this film, but she brought as much to this as she did in Black Swan. Totally different role and character and totally different chops needed, but none the less she takes a possible throw away character and gave her some life.The film does a lot of jumping from earth, back to Asgard, back to earth, back to Asgard, etc. So the pacing is an important thing. For the most part I thought the pacing was handled well, though I thought the final act did feel a bit rushed. The 2nd act suffers from the origin dead zone that is inherent with these films. But again, Branagh shows why he was the perfect director for this film.I did not see this in 3D. Mainly because it is a post-production 3D converted film. So I can't attest to how good the 3D is. The effects are good, the sound design is perfect, with the sound of the hammer being a major highlight. When Thor wields it with all his might, you feel it.Very good performances and capable directing make this a fun movie to watch. Be sure to stay around until the very end of the credits as we are given a peek at what looks like the villain in The Avengers.","

"leplatypus","23 June 2013","As soon as the movie starts, I could feel this adaptation was another Marvel failure (following the Spidey reboot, Daredevil, Hulk, the Xmen or Iron man sequels). It's a pity because they had everything needed for a great movie (an original character, a solid cast). They just couldn't grasp the vision of Nordic mythology and Stan Lee's genius. Here, the CGI production is disastrous as they stupidly enhance the Asgard sets with highly golden colorization to pass for gold! Next, as the heroes goes into the frozen realm, the effects are rather bad. Then, as Thor arrives to earth, his landing isn't NYC but American southwest, thus that is to say nothing except rock and desert landscapes. His Midgard adventure has no deepness except a good fight against his nemesis, the Destructor. This disappointment is also felt with Natalie's performance (who was my main motivation to watch this flick) as she just brought her friendly smile to an empty character. I don't know what other Marvel fans think about it but we are very far away here from Simonson's, Claremont or Romita's territories. In conclusion, Marvel has always the nose to get the real man or woman for the role but they never understand that a comic adaptation needs more. Instead of having Stan the man doing funny cameos in each movie, they should give him the script as well as his ideas totally revolution the medium!","

Now living in Earth, he befriends Jane(Portman) and her friends Darcy(Jennings) and Stellan's charcther. But will Thor go back to Asgard and will his brother Loki(Hiddleston) turn bad and take over as king of Asgard.The effects are very good,the action sequences were great and overall it was a fun movie.

Michael Straczynsky (Creator of Babylon 5) wrote the script, Kenneth Branagh directed, and it had two Academy Award winning actors (Portman and Sir Anthony Hopkins). All of this meant it was going to be really good or horribly bad. There really wasn't going to be a middle ground here.First, let's give credit to a smart script. First, the characters had depth, especially the character of Loki, who was not written as a one-dimensional bad guy. The actor who played Thor had a lot of charisma. a bit of my problem, they actually had to write this as ""Oh, wait, Loki is a bad guy?"" kind of plot progression. Okay. I guess so, but that would require your audience to a) Not have ever read the comic or b) completely be ignorant of Norse mythology to not know the God of Mischief was going to be the bad guy here! Titanic had less plot tension. JMS, while taking a few liberties with characters, is very faithful to the original comic (which has had nearly a fifty year run). Usually I deplore the use of CGI, but here it worked in creating the fantastical realms of Norse Mythology.Another point. All these Marvel films are all leading up to the Avengers movie. They even make references to the other films. (Hulk and Iron Man).","

"DICK STEEL","28 April 2011","One of the main issues with the ambitious Avengers film is the introduction of the less than scientific, reality based elements of the Marvel films and characters to date, where radiation is root cause for the creation of The Hulk, Fantastic Four and Spider-man, and technology behind the likes of Tony Stark's Iron Man, meaning they're not too far fetched if you're a fan of science fiction. Even gene mutation still falls within the boundaries of believability. But with Thor comes something from the magical and fantasy realm, which undoubtedly will open the door to more powerful villains not bounded by the laws of physics at least, but still with the villain possessing incredible powers, unless the story is compelling, we're going to find ourselves stuck with a massively powerful hero, what more when he's a god?Which is what made Thor somewhat a refreshing change in the way comic book heroes are portrayed in recent years, whether DC (who will have its hands full with Superman, sharing the same pain points), or Marvel. Enter Kenneth Branagh to try and make Thor more palatable to the reality so far in the Marvel film base, hitting it off where Iron Man 2 had hinted at its ending, before introducing us to a brief history of Asgard and Odin (Anthony Hopkins), together with his sons Thor and Loki and that aged old feud with the Frost Giants. In fact the story by J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich is already found in the theatrical trailers, with the arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) being cast from his would be throne and onto Earth, and finding himself to be quite the mortal without his mythical hammer Mjolnir which he has to find with the help of scientists Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her friends Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy (Kate Dennings).AS I mentioned earlier, the story is purely functional at this stage, going from scene to scene in quite the fish out of water fashion where the Nordic god of thunder finds himself caught up in poor slapstick comedy (how many times can he be hit by a vehicle?). Redemption doesn't come easy for the big guy even as he's made to feel guilty for his misdeeds when on Asgard that his brother never failed to remind him of, making Loki (Tom Hiddleston) chief villain just because he's looking toward being the favoured son of Odin. Yes the main villain of the story uses more of his brains than brawn, but is no pushover when the situation calls for a more physical response.And the battle sequences impressed, which is kind of a surprise since I never associated Branagh as one who can film kinetically charged action for the big screen. With Thor's magical prowess brought about by Mjolnir, the CG here lives up in crafting the kind of extravaganza and incredible spectacle when Thor wields his trusty hammer into battle, twirling, throwing, flying and calling in some mean looking, bad weather associated reinforcements. A film like this couldn't possibly be done years ago, and technology coupled with an artistic team's imagination and reference from Thor's source material, made the big battle sequences interesting. But I will add that one should steer clear of 3D since it's converted in post production, with nothing that truly stood out to justify the viewing in 3D.Chris Hemsworth was a relatively unknown Australian, but I guess like Hugh Jackman this could be his ticket into the big league, having to look the part of the hero and portray him to a T with that streak of arrogance that required a lesson in humility and about the sanctity of life. Yes although it doesn't call for tremendous acting chops, I suppose looking the part and playing it convincingly with those rippling muscles, is already half the battle won. Anthony Hopkins lends that bucket load of gravitas as Odin (just as how Liam Neeson's Zeus in the Clash of the Titans remake was welcomed), while Tom Hiddleston as Loki provided that conflicting villain who's an excellent liar corrupted by power.While it has the benefit of Hollywood It Girl Natalie Portman counted amongst its ranks as the main squeeze that Thor falls for, the romance here is a little bit stretched as well, since the two hardly spend quality time together to develop genuine feelings, with Jane sealing the deal just because Thor looks good when he got his groove back, armour, weapon and all, together with that sparkle in those blue eyes surrounded by those golden facial locks. The characterization of Jane Foster is wafer thin, and the love story lacked any real emotional depth, relying on a mere summary of someone else's narration than to come from pure feelings, but I guess having her around lends star appeal to the film.And as for cameos (look away now if you choose not to be spoilt), well, look out for Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye who saved all nuances of action for Avengers, and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury making his much ado about nothing appearance in the coda after the film proper, although in Thor's case it turned out to be a little bit weaker since it's supposed to tease into Avengers directly, and well, expecting something really does take the fun out of anything.Thor the film did what it had to, and successfully introduced the character to film audiences in anticipation of a huge ensemble in The Avengers. It's getting crowded, but here's a feather in the cap for Marvel in having to chalk up another expected blockbuster and hopefully boosting comic book sales as well. Highly recommended, and I can't wait for the rest of the slated Marvel heroes to appear on the big screen in weeks to come!","

"garyvanhorn","17 May 2011","Thor is a bit of a harder sell as far as comic book characters go. I mean, how do you transform an ancient Norse god and 60's comic book character into something a modern movie going audience is going to like? Start with great casting (Chris Hemsworth is a dead ringer for Thor), add a brilliant screenplay by J. Michael Strazynski, and mix it with top notch special effects and you end up with a movie that is halfway believable (in a comic book way) and very entertaining.Thor is an arrogant, perhaps spoiled, young warrior that seeks glory for himself and Asgard but nearly reignites an ancient war with the Frost Giants in the process. For his arrogance and poor judgement, Thor is stripped of his power and banished to Earth by Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and his hammer lands in New Mexico and becomes something akin to the sword in the stone of Arthurian legend, ""Whoever holds this hammer, should they be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor"". All of this is a result of the subtle manipulations of Thor's evil brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who seeks power only for himself. Throughout most of the film Loki works from the shadows to manipulate people and events towards an end of his design, as only the trickster god can do. Thor must then work to reclaim his power and stop his brother's machinations, gaining some wisdom and humility along the way.There is really very little to dislike about the film, other than a couple of minor casting decisions, Hogun, one of the famed warriors three, is apparently Asian for some reason, and Heimdall is black. Both choices seem odd for Norse gods but it doesn't really harm the movie, they just seem out of place. I would have liked to see Thor get beat up a bit more in the final two fight scenes with The Destroyer and Loki as both were relatively short and could have benefited from a couple of extra minutes. Overall Thor is a very fun, very entertaining comic book movie that only heightens my anticipation for the upcoming Captain America and Avengers movies.","

"keremgo","22 July 2013","It was really a bad movie. Sorry Thor fans. I personally never been a fan of these fake god characters. Humans with superpowers who believe they are gods. Never made sense since I was a little kid.Perhaps I don't like it, because of the effect of deep and well executed stories of movies like Drive and Europa Report, everything on THOR felt like shallow, superficial and boring...There are 3 worlds in total, one little town in earth, one world of the ice dudes and Asgard (or whatever) - Most of the movie took place in a little (I mean really little) town in USA (perhaps nothing but a movie set). You can see it's ending on high altitude shots and population was perhaps 100 people? Dialogs are meaningless, character interactions are superficial (an ordinary girl of earth fell in love with a handsome ""god"" wow!) story is extremely simple. I'm taking that much simple stories as an insult to my intellect. I think the people hated from Prometheus are probably people who loved THOR, since there's nothing deep and complicated going on, to think about after movie.These line of characters and stories were good on earlier movies. Iron Man 1 and 2 was good, The Incredible Hulk was really good. But with Thor and Avengers they started to ruin it. Iron Man 3 wasn't different also. Pointless, repetitive, superficial, shallow...I still didn't see Captain America which has connection to these series of movies because of the Avengers. I don't know if I can stand with another ""America saves the world kills all the bad guys with different colors and cultures from other countries"" flick.Watch it only if you are HUGE fan of that comic character...","

Such a blend may seem out of place in other films, but ""Thor"" blends these ideas well. The plot is well explained and engaging. Visuals are great, especially the roaring clouds and the fight scenes on the bridge. Both Thor and Loki are superbly depicted characters. Everything from the characters, story and visuals are so convincing and real. ""Thor"" is very entertaining, but it is more than just a popcorn summer blockbuster.","

"3xHCCH","1 May 2011","Marvel does it again with another A-quality screen interpretation of the comic book hero The Mighty Thor. The heart-stopping action, the dark family drama and the well-placed humor were all perfectly realized on screen by Shakespearian director Kenneth Branagh. I wonder why the DC people could not do the same with their similarly iconic superheroes. (Really, Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern,? Please! But I digress.)It is amazing that the two main characters Thor and Loki were played by new actors who were unknown to me. Chris Hemsworth is perfectly cast as the cocky Nordic thunder god. Not only does he look the part physically, the way he acted out his character's arc is well-done and worthy of audience empathy. It was not forced nor corny. Tom Hiddleston also convincingly plays out his character Loki with the unpredictability this god was known for. Anthony Hopkins plays Odin by ear, as he is well-known for. Natalie Portman, fresh from her Oscar for Best Actress, looks as beautiful as her character requires. It was also exciting to see a cameo by Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton (""Hawkeye"") with his bow and arrow!The story is solid. Those of us who did not know Thor now know him and care what happens to him. The fight scenes were very exciting. The special effects were very good for the most part. For negatives, I did not really like how fake Asgard looked and I did not like the metallic robot used to attack the earth. The costumes on Asgard also reminded me too much of various Bozanian bad guys from the old Voltes V cartoons. There were some inconsistencies about how Bifrost tele-porter works. Overall though, this was excellent and the first real big action blockbuster of this summer. I did not even watch the 3D version.","

"drqshadow-reviews","14 April 2012","A solid enough popcorn muncher that never even hints at reaching a deeper level. Chris Hemsworth does what he sets out to, making waves with his appearance if not his acting, while Natalie Portman tries in vain to turn her uncertain supporting role into something more significant. It's really two films under one heading, as the developments in Thor's celestial homeworld of Asgard provide gorgeous vistas but no meat, and the fish-out-of-water character moments of the god of thunder fallen to Earth deliver good-natured, if shallow, fun. With a few listless fight scenes thrown in to stir the waters, Thor never runs the risk of growing stagnant but also doesn't give its audience much to think about. It's all spelled out with no regard for subtlety, hammered into the pre-planned groundwork for Marvel's upcoming Avengers mega- pic with the kind of blunt nuance one might expect from a character known primarily for his rash, impatient brawn. I had fun, but it didn't leave me clamoring for a follow-up.","

"FlashCallahan","30 April 2011","This, much like a few other comic book movies coming out this year, is one that doesn't have a massive fan base like Spiderman, Batman et al.To some this is a massive gamble of a film, I mean, Kenneth Branagh directing a movie like this? But it works on so many levels. Not only is the movie split into two, but this is the first of the Avengers movies that delves deep into the world of marvel, and sets a time line for the films.Iron Man 2 did well with CA's shield and Thors hammer, but this probably explains why Bruce Banner had that smirk on his face at the end of TIH, but also tells us that Thor was on earth when Stark was having is trouble with his demons, and when Stark met William Hurt ant the end of TIH.And also, we get to see Jeremy Remmer as Hawkeye, in a brilliant, if totally pointless, cameo.Thor could have gone either way, Branagh could have hammed it up to a Flash Gordon standard, but saves us with a dash of Theatrics whenever we are on Thors home planet. But strangely though, for me, the best scenes were the one where we see Thor as a fish out of water, when he first lands on earth.There are some truly hilarious sequences, and it almost reminds one of Universal soldier, where Devereux first escapes the U-sol unit and has to adapt to present day.Hemsworth, is great as the title character, doing serious, romantic, and funny with ease. Back on his home planet, we are treated to a truly non-hammy performance from Hopkins, which surprised me as i was expecting another Van Helsing turn from the great Welshman. Hiddleston also puts in a good performance as Loki, not overdoing the bad guy routine you would expect from a god of mischief.Russo should sack her agent though, she does nothing and is a waste, as is Portman, who gets her pay-cheque actually given to her halfway through the film.The action is minimal, but mind-blowing, and not 3D essential. The main set pieces show some good ideas and are loud and exciting enough. Whwn the destroyer lands on earth and attacks the town, it almost veers toward Masters of the universe territory, but thanks to additional characters,thoughts of He Man soon blow away.So it's another solid effort from Marvel, another superhero introduced to the masses that is worthy of a sequel, and one that has obviously had a lot of love and effort put into it.Of course there is the obligatory Samuel L. Jackson scene at the end which makes us salivate more for the forthcoming Avengers epic.Captain America may be the first Avenger, but he has a lot of work to do to brat this god.","

"rogerdarlington","7 May 2011","I'm a bit of a sucker for super-hero movies, although I was unfamiliar with this particular character. Equally unfamiliar to me was the actor who plays this Norse god, 27 year old Australian Chris Kemsworth, and the one - British Tom Hiddleston - who portrays Thor's brother Loki. But I'm a fan of Anthony Hopkins, who here has fun as the top god Odin, and of Natalie Portman, who here is rather wasted after her terrific performance in ""Black Swan"". And then I was intrigued by the director: Kenneth Branagh who more usually directs works by Shakespeare (although let's not forget ""Frankenstein"").The result is entertaining and fun, although the visuals are often stronger than the plot or the dialogue. I saw it in 3D but the extra dimension did not add as much as one would hope. While other men lose their mojo, Thor mislays something called his Mjolnir (his mighty hammer) but, once it's back in his hand, the young cosmologist (Portman) is all over him (so why does he leave her behind?).Note: Like ""Ironman "" and Ironman 2"", if you sit to the end of the credits, you'll see a clip which is setting us up for another Marvel Comics movie ""The Avengers"".","

Seems like a script by committee situation. An artless product by all accounts.The only redeeming quality was the lead actor. Despite having a strong cast and a respected director, the film delivered Hollywood triteness at its worst.I'm not sure why Hollywood penguins insist on making products terrible. No matter how many trend data sheets they sift through, a good story is not a sum of popular topics or a mix-and-match of proved techniques. A good story has a voice of its own and this had none. Branagh obviously didn't fight hard enough to get anything valuable here. It shows no effort. As I said, artless.I only speak so harshly here because in 2011 there's no excuse to spend 150mill and this is your end product.","

"ThomasMagnumPI","29 April 2011","It's been said that good comic books can often times outshine the best book, song, film, or television program. The in-depth story details, accompanied by amazing illustrations give comics their own identity. Well, then there's the rare case where film captures that and brings it to life. Such is the case with Thor.This Thor movie is amazing. You have the color & fun of Spider-Man, the darkness & mystery of Batman or X-Men and the grounded cool reality of Iron Man. Thor is massive but they played it just right.It's easy to see why Kenneth Branagh is considered a film making master. He delivered a film that looks and feels exactly like a live action Thor comic. (The good ones anyway) His detailed yet not too busy screen is filled with tender as well as cerebral moments but when it's Hammer time... run for cover!! This quote sums it up best for me...""Thor has a real emotional depth - it's unusually soulful for a superhero film. Yes, Christopher Nolan's Batman efforts had a similar sensitivity, though it came from a darker and, thus, ultimately less interesting place; Thor is more bittersweet. There's a hopefulness to the film, particularly its ending, that verges on elegiac. A winning blend of thrill and feeling, respect and irreverence, Thor lifts Marvel's movie stocks considerably"" I can't believe how much I enjoyed this film.","

It was, the now infamous scene that takes place after the credits in Iron Man 2, that got me excited. As time went on, hearing Kenneth Branagh had directed the film and seeing some pretty exciting trailers, I thought Thor was going to be the hit of the summer, worthy of kicking ass over Micheal Bay's Transformers, but no.Thor is unbelievably mediocre. Between the story of Thor, which if you're going to see the movie you most likely already know, and what is shown in the trailer, anyone could close their eyes and imagine exactly what you're going to see, almost shot for shot. Some people would call this a good movie, I can it horribly unimaginative.The film, even when lacking in action, never lacks in trying to squeeze every possible laugh of it's audience, as guilty as a television sitcom. Branagh also heavily relies on the pretty boy looks of his leading man, hoping to distract us with Thor's contagious smile so we not take notice at how badly written the dialogue is.Even in 3D, there is nothing that comes through the screen and is common feel through-out the audience. The kids wowed at the special effects, the girls giggled and smiled and the rest of us, hoping it's going to get better.","

"Troy_Campbell","24 April 2011","Of the new Marvel movies within the Avengers universe Thor is not the best, but it's by far the funniest. The Iron Man pictures have the cocky swagger of Tony Stark which proffers a bit of humour, but director Branagh (yes, the same Kenneth Branagh who made his name directing and starring in a litany of Shakespeare adaptations) has ensured the out-of-this-world concept, and the out-of-this-world locations, both of which could've very easily come across as ridiculous and tacky, are enjoyable thanks to his tongue being firmly in his cheek. The fish-out-water comedy that opens up once the powerless Thor is in New Mexico, and still thinks of himself as a God, is priceless. Branagh knows humour is the perfect way to lighten the mood and allow audience members to just go with the flow rather than nitpicking at the numerous absurd elements of the film, and he wisely embraces it.Surprisingly, Branagh demonstrates a deft touch filming the action scenes too. The set pieces, all featuring Thor, vary from a bone-crunching intergalactic battle against the ogre-ish Frost Giants, a rough and gritty rumble with the human SHIELD agents (who have a sharpshooter on their side that Marvel fans will recognise), a showdown in the streets of New Mexico against an unstoppable alien robot, and the (anti)climactic encounter on Asgard with his brother Loki. The final clash aside â€“ which is a letdown â€“ the action is tough, exciting and shot with flair. The CGI is mostly well done â€“ some of the vistas created are stunning â€“ although extreme wide shots which try to integrate people suffer from a glitchy effect which makes it look noticeably fake. Thankfully the 3D has been utilised carefully by Branagh and it never distracts, but it doesn't really add to the proceedings either and probably could've been omitted.It's doubtful that the ex-'Home and Away' star Hemsworth won't be thrown every script under the sun after this. Bulking up massively for the role, the Aussie certainly looks the part and he has also nailed the semi-British-semi-American accent required, but there's more than that. He is terrific as Thor in an acting capacity, convincing both as the egotistical and immature God of the first half of the movie and the wiser, more contemplative leader of the latter half, remaining charismatic the entire way through. Elsewhere, Hopkins is an arresting force as King Odin and commands the screen whenever on, whilst Hiddleston makes for an excellently snaky and slimy Loki. On the flipside, Portman struggles as the plain Jane. Not for one second do you believe she's a risk-taking scientist, nor that she would fall for Thor like she does, however she does share a decent chemistry with Skarsgaard and Dennings, her two Earthling associates, and in the case of the latter, the frequent comic-relief. I must also mention that Rene Russo makes an appearance as Thor's mother, a welcome return for the actress who hasn't worked since 2005.Branagh has proved the naysayers wrong and delivered a fun-filled adventure with roaring action and hefty laughs in equal parts.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)","

"Zac_La_Porte","31 July 2022","Marvel Studios presents Thor, an entertaining superhero blockbuster with a wonderful leading cast, but honestly quite an underwhelming trip to the movies. This action-loaded fantasy-adventure movie is nothing much other than standard for a Marvel movie. Often it's very watchable, there's great special effects and humour is sprinkled throughout, but what else is it?This movie depicts the story of the Marvel Comics character Thor, in which he is exiled by his father (also known as the King of Asgard) to our planet Earth and finds himself defending the humans. Viewers can expect some occasional jokes, a fantasy-action adventure plot and just a typical Marvel superhero movie, as mentioned above. But all the sci-fi action and fantasy stuff isn't too complex and makes the story easy to follow along with. The technique of telling the story will likely give Marvel fans a popcorn-fun time watching Thor.But as expected, the storyline is extremely standard, a lot of the action may be predictable to those who've seen too much similar to it, and most of the elements are instantly forgettable. It's not to say Kenneth Branagh didn't do a spectacular job in his role of directing and the special effects are so-last-Tuesday, but Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Natalie Portman as an astrophysicist are two brilliant performances worthwhile.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

Asgard was excellently realised and it really hits the core emotional beats well... but Thor gets bogged down in its own formulaic love-at-first-sight-subplot (that both wastes our time and Portman's talent) which is a huge shame. It's a faulty film but with inspiring moments of cosmic wonder that would've made Ditko happy as the proverbial Larry.","

"BaronBl00d","27 October 2012","Visually striking, generally well-directed, competently performed super-hero epic made with state of the art CGI effects. Norse mythology via Marvel comics and Stan Lee are brought to life here. While not your typical Marvel comic ""epic"" - Thor spends most of its time in the world of Thor, Odin, Loke, and Frost Giants - a banished race. The story was inventive and conceived imaginatively. Anthony Hopkins does a great job playing Odin and relative newcomer Chris Hemsworth makes an appealing Thor, even an affable one for guys as well as girls. The rest of the cast was judiciously cast. As Loki, the villain of the film, Tom Hiddleston stands out. Beautiful Natalie Portman plays the female love-interest. Veteran, and a good character actor, Stellan Skarsgard plays a pivotal role as well. i liked really most of what I saw. Director Kenneth Branagh does a serviceable job with the material - and adds some class to this Marvel addition. you are given clues throughout that The Avengers is on its way.","

"Screen_Blitz","2 November 2017","Thor is an excitement-filled action adventure that competently puts the God of Thunder on the pedestal with flashy visual scope serving a warm welcome for another Marvel comics entry. Taking the director's chair is Kenneth Branaugh who takes the spirit of the titular hero and slaps it on screen with endearing charisma, and the results shine, though not in a way that breaths game-changer. As opposed to many heroes of the Avengers team, Thor is not your typical modern day hero. This hammer-wielding god combines average superhero elements and clashes them with the fantasy-esque world that bears reminiscence to Greek mythology. He is an inhabitant of a mystical world of unnatural wonders outside of Earth, and serves as the center of the story that draws small parallels to William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. In some context, it is an superhero origin story that almost falls in the category of an epic, though perhaps that classification would be rooting too deep. This film is takes us in the distant world of Asgard, ruled by the mighty king Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins). Under his wing are his two sons Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston). As Odin prepares to crown the former as king, the realm becomes threatened by evil Frost Giants. Determined to protect his home, Thor goes against his father's orders and sets out to find against the evildoers. When his actions heightens a war between Asgard and the giants, Odin strips Thor of his powers and exiles him to Earth where he is forced to enlist the help of scientists Eric Slevig (played by Stellan Skarsgard) and Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) and their intern Darcy Lewis (played by Kat Denning) to help regain his powers. Meanwhile, back on Asgard, Loki, jealous by his father's initial plans to choose Thor over him as the new ruler, hatches an evil plan of his own. Kenneth Branaugh crafts a refreshing picture of the titular Marvel comics star with solid precision, and from start to finish, never takes telling a compelling story for granted. The premise introduces the world of Asgard, warmed with dazzling CGI, and the characters very effectively, and once everyone steps into the action, the results pay off. The first special effects-laden sequence featuring Thor, Loki, and their fellow warriors battling against the Frost Giants not only satisfy with their effects glaze, but energetically set the story in motion following Thor's banishment from the home realm. His quest to regain his strength to fight against the evil that has threatened his home holds the most meant, but also lies a few of the narrative flaws. The story feels a bit rushed at times to the point where you hold the feeling that a half-hour of more runtime could have been more necessary to add more gravity to the plot. Nonetheless, the best thing to say that is that with the script, written by a team of three writers, keeps things rolling without spending too much time sketching out connections with the Marvel Cinematic Universe beyond SHIELD Agent Coulson, played by Clark Gregg, making a sweet appearance as a supporting figure. Chris Hemsworth proves to be the satisfying choice for the titular role, playing his character of humanity and clever sense of humor. His romantic chemistry with Natalie Portman is a bit weak, but perhaps less important to her characterization. English actor Tom Hiddleston on the other hand, submits arguably one of the most appealing villainous performances ever brought to the superhero realm, operating his role with both menace and darkly rooted charisma. Thor is a fun picture for both fans and a little bit of non-fans of Marvel Comics. Kenneth Branaugh crafts a warmly entertaining thrill ride that nicely meets the bar of summer superhero movies. For the filmmaker accomplishes, there is plenty to be offered in this solid rendition of its titular hero, though nothing destined to blow many other superhero entries out of the water. In conclusion, it fits the bill.","

"intelearts","30 August 2011","This could have been the new Flash Gordon - cheesy and frankly bad, but with Ken Brannaugh in charge we get a film that frankly is one of the better superhero films. Brannaugh is best known for Shakespearean theater, and Shakespeare on film, as well as Mozart's Magic Flute; and it is perhaps these very qualities that carry the fantasy sections so well.Thor, son of Odin, attacks the Norse gods enemies without permission, and is exiled to Earth, where he meets an astrophysicist (Natalie Portman). PLotting is get simple, but not simplistic, and the fact that we can follow the story clearly at all stages again says much for the director.All in all, this is a very successful film: exciting, interesting, and surprisingly intelligent. We enjoyed it a lot.","

"freemantle_uk","1 May 2011","We all know that in 2012 we should be getting the ultimate superhero film, The Avengers, being set up by Marvel Studios. But they have to set it up first, starting with Iron Man in 2008. Now Marvel have to turned to another on of their properties, Thor, and again made another entertaining superhero film.In 970 A.D. there was epic war between the Asgardians lead by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and the frost giants, who want to conquer Earth. Years later Odin makes his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) his heir but a group of frost giants attempt to steal the Casket of Ancient Winters. Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), convicts Thor and his companions to go to war against the Frost Giants, against their father's orders. As punishment Thor is banished to Earth with his powers and hammer, Mjolnir taken away from him. On Earth Thor befriends a young scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her companions Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skargard) and Darcy (Kat Dennings). Thor sets out to receive his hammer from SHIELD whilst in Asgard Loki continues his plotting ways to take control.Thor is Marvel's interpretation of Norse mythology and he is a God, with powers to much. A problem could have been that Thor would have too powerful so would not be in an real danger, but the writers were able to counter at it in two ways. First is Thor does have powerful adversaries, who can match or at least give him a good run for his money. The other idea was that Thor's powers were taken away from him and he become not more then a physically fit man who was fallible. Thor has to earn his powers back and prove himself, that is the core of the story.Marvel has made bold choices when picking their directors: Jon Favreau was an actor before turning into a family-comedy director and Louis Leterrier was a full on action director. Kenneth Branagh is known for making Shakespeare adaptation and films about classic stories, so it was interesting choice for both the director and the studio. Whether or not you like Branagh's movies there is no denying he has a grand visual style and a perfect fit for bringing all these different worlds to life: the bright fantasy world of Asgard, the dark cold world of Jotunheim and Earth looking like it does in Iron Man. Thor itself is a strange mix of fantasy and science-fiction, trying to combine the two. The special effects were of a high standard and the action was good, with Hemsworth being particularly convincing as a fighter, beating his way through SHIELD. I'm sure if Branagh returns for a sequel his action direction will improve. Branagh ensured that there was a health mix of action, drama, romance and comedy, all the ingredients needed for a fun at the cinema. They are obviously trying to be like Iron Man, having a prologue then showing the set-up and matching its tone.There is a great cast in the film, I expect Hemsworth will be a big star. He was really convincing as a young warrior who is impulsive and defiant and has to learn to be responsible. Hiddleston is wonderfully weasel like, a power hunger individual who manipulates everyone around him, he is a complex character, the opposite of Thor. Loki lacks strength but is cunning and his character was similar to Commodus in Gladiator and Wormtongue in Lord in the Rings. Portman and Hemsworth have excellent chemistry together and I expect Jane's knowledge will be of use later on in the series. Skargard's character was basically in the film to arch Vikings myths to the characters, but it was done effectively. And Thor is easily Anthony Hopkins' best performance in a film for a long time.I do have criticise that Thor did rely a little too much on comic relief. Of course a film like this does need a little comedy, but the Dracy character was only in the film so all her lines can be jokes and wisecracks.For comic book fans there are little references for you, including a cameo by Jeremy Remner as Hawkeye. I would to have like to seen a little news footage showing the events of Iron Man 2, because they were going on at the same time as Thor. And everyone needs to stay behind for the post-credit scene because it will be important for later films.","

"jayraskin1","9 August 2012","I know that Kenneth Branagh is one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of our time. For this reason, I imagine that this film was an experiment on his part. The experiment was to have everybody act as if they were 12 year olds doing their first Junior High Shakespeare play with a gym teacher doing the direction. In others words, have the acting be so awful that there is not one believable line delivered or one scene that is not aimed at the twentieth row in the balcony. Make it so broad that even six years old could not miss every nuance. Since his movies with brilliant acting, like ""Othello"" did terrible at the box office, his theory was that if he had his actors did the worst possible acting, the movie would be a success. He was right. Besides the bottom of the barrel acting, there should be a warning label about the writing. Lines like ""Magic is just science and science is just magic"" are guaranteed to subtract I.Q. points as fast as watching Fox News.The movie is such a mishmash of clichÃ©s from science fiction, comic books superheroes, and Norse mythology, that one is hardly surprised to see a Transformers Robot in the middle of an homage/rip-off of a Scene from Superman II. The special effects are about on a par with the 1980's children's television series, ""The Power Rangers.""","

"mcugot","6 September 2022","This is Thor! Not the guy in Ragnarok and Love and Thunder. The plot for this movie is a simple and easy to follow movie with a like able villain. I will say the movie did not have me engaged. The theme is the generic ""Who am I? What's my potential?"" theme. The acting and dialogue is good. And the editing is well paced and the effects are good for 2011. I love the music as it fits the cosmic and mythology side of things. There's not much to say about this other than it's good but has flaws. The Thor franchise is my least favorite in the MCU though. But I'd say Kenneth Branagh did a decent job at introducing Thor into the MCU. Not one of a kind or anything special though. Definitely watch this for the Avengers though! 7.5/10. C.","

"GusF","19 September 2015","Although I had never even heard of the comic version of Thor before the film was released, I was looking forward to this more than any other film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it was directed by my favourite living director Kenneth Branagh. He may not be the first name that springs to mind to direct a comic book special effects extravaganza but he was the perfect choice given the film's Shakespearean themes. It may be an atypical Branagh film as it was really his first truly mainstream one since ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" in 1994 but his direction is typically brilliant in both the quieter character moments and the hugely impressive action sequences, which were a bit of a departure for him. The film has an extremely strong script which is full of wit and great dialogue. This is certainly my favourite MCU film so far.In his first leading role, Chris Hemsworth gives an excellent performance as the title character. At the beginning of the film, Thor is an arrogant, short-tempered, impulsive crown prince who fails to appreciate or even consider the consequences of his actions, a character trait which leads him to disobey his father Odin and attack the Frost Giants at Jotunheim. A furious Odin strips Thor of his powers and banishes him to Earth as a mortal as punishment. During his exile on Earth, he becomes a better man as he learns humility and sees the folly of his ways. He has a great character arc as we are able to see him grow and change over the course of the film. Tom Hiddleston is wonderful as his adoptive and treacherous brother Loki, who is extremely jealous of Thor and has a major chip on his shoulder as a result. He presents himself as the honest, responsible, dutiful son but, in reality, he is far from it. Speaking of Shakespeare, Loki bears many similarities to Edmund from ""King Lear"" and Iago from ""Othello"", both of whom manipulate those around them with ease. The climactic battle between Thor and Loki reminded me of Edmund's duel with Edgar. They also reminded me of the depiction of Moses and Rameses in ""The Ten Commandments"" as they are likewise a pair of princes, one of whom is adopted, who are in conflict over which of them will succeed their royal father.Anthony Hopkins may have relatively little screen time as Odin but he brings his considerable talent to bear as the All-Father of Asgard. He loves his two sons but has a difficult relationship with both of them. While I thankfully have a very close relationship with my dad, I have always been fascinated by this sort of father-son relationship and Hopkins, Hemsworth and Hiddleston are all very effective in portraying it. Natalie Portman is very good as Jane Foster and has great chemistry with Hemsworth. In contrast to Pepper Potts in the ""Iron Man"" films, Jane is a very strong character. She is extremely intelligent, capable, resourceful, brave, imaginative and is not afraid to stand up for herself. She is a great source of love and support to Thor but she is also a character in her own right and contributes a great deal to the plot. To a large extent, Jane's good influence is what allows Thor to become a better man, something which I did not think was true of Pepper as regards Tony Stark even if that was what they were going for. Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd gives a great performance as Jane's initially sceptical colleague Erik Selvig, who loves Jane like a father and does not want to see her get hurt by Thor. Kat Dennings is a laugh riot as Jane's assistant Darcy Lewis and has many of the funniest lines in the film. Clark Gregg has a bigger role as Agent Coulson (""Son of Coul"") on this occasion but the character is still pretty much devoid of a personality. The film also features great appearances in smaller roles from Colm Feore as Laufey, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Jaimie Alexander as Sif and Rene Russo as Frigga. Oh, and I adored J. Michael Straczynski's cameo! The action scenes are very exciting, particularly the battles with the Frost Giants at Jotunheim and with the Destroyer in New Mexico. Visually speaking, it is an extraordinarily well designed film. I loved the sets and the costumes. Asgard seems as if it could be a real place, which I think is very important in a film like this. The Destroyer is fantastic. The film has the best special effects that I have seen in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film so far. It also has a great score by Branagh's regular composer Patrick Doyle, who unusually does not have a role in the film. In fact, none of Branagh's regular stock company such as Richard Briers, Brian Blessed and Richard Clifford appear in the film, though Feore and SkarsgÃ¥rd later appeared in ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" and ""Cinderella"" respectively.Overall, this is an excellent film which I am glad to say that I enjoyed even more than I anticipated. Except for ""Peter's Friends"", I have to yet to see a Branagh film that I did not love. However, even that film was very well written, acted and directed. Its very depressing storyline was just not to my tastes. It is a shame that Branagh did not return to direct ""Thor: The Dark World"".","

"MihaiSorinToma","12 November 2017","After getting exiled from Asgard as a result of his foolish and disrespectful actions, Thor is sent to Midgard (Earth) as an ordinary man. Seeking to redeem himself in front of his father, the king, he will begin the search for his lost hammer with the help of a local scientist which happens to be investigating the stars right where he landed.It's a fantastic movie which presents the World in which Thor and his friends and foes undergo their adventures. Being faced with this new exiled status, Thor's character must evolve from a spoiled and self-centered boy to a prince worthy of his father's crown. And this is exactly what this movie is about, with a bit of positive and negative help from the inhabitants of earth. The movie is filled with action sequences, which, accompanied by some wonderful CGI, make it a very good watch. The plot is good for this ""introduction"", but nothing extraordinary, with a bit of drama here and there and a bit of suspense, but again, nothing that can wow the viewer in any way. The producers decided to take a quite serious approach regarding this one, with little comedy aspects silently inserted from time to time, very good for changing the mood.As said before, it's an intro movie, designed to present Thor and his fantastic world, clearly leaving plenty of space for future sequels, which is to be seen for its action and CGI, aspects at which it is very good. It is a bit left behind by its plot cannot raise high enough to impress, but makes this film an overall good.","

"hknina","15 May 2011","Just came back from watching Thor - and I loved it! The 3D really made the movie feel more alive and intense. And I liked the fact that it was used in a way that I didn't jump in the seat from some item ""coming out of the screen"", it just made it more exciting to watch. The acting was good, Hemsworth was perfect for the role, just as I have pictured Thor to be. And the movie had a lot of humor as well as action. I liked the switch between Asgaard and our world, it gave the portrait of the gods a twist and some humor. And I loved Thor with the hammer in the action scenes - that is some power to have.This might not be a movie that will haunt your mind, but for the purpose I went to watch it - pure entertainment - it was perfect. As the ending came I just wanted more Thor and more gods. Looking forward to a potential sequel :)","

"zardoz-13","20 May 2011","Although the newest addition to the Marvel Comics' cinematic super hero pantheon boasts polished production values and a charismatic cast, ""Hamlet"" director Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"" qualifies as business as usual. This preposterous, larger-than-life, 115-minute, PG-13 rated opus shifts scenes between contemporary New Mexico and the fabled realm of Asgard where Norse royalty reside in opulent splendor. ""Agent Cody Banks"" scenarists Ashley Edward Miller & Zack Stentz along with ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" scribe Don Payne gave ""Thor"" their best shot based on a story by ""Ninja Assassin"" scenarist J. Michael Straczynski and ""Poseidon"" writer Mark Protosevich. Despite those best efforts, ""Thor"" amounts to a standard-issue 'origins' epic about Odin's arrogant offspring. No surprises lurk in this predictable, but sometimes amusing epic about the hammer wielding Norse champion. Basically, ""Thor"" boils down to a boy-gets-hammer, boy-loses-hammer, and boy-gets-hammer back adventure. During this lukewarm lark, our hero acquaints himself with the meaning of humility after his stern father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) has banished him from his own celestial kingdom. Handsome Aussie stud Chris Hemsworth, cast as Captain Kirk's father in the ""Star Trek"" reboot, provides the appropriate brawn and blond hair as the eponymous hero afflicted with anger management issues. Mind you, the real Thor of lore possessed red hair and a red beard. Meantime, Academy Award winning actress Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, and Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd enliven the Earth scenes, while Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins lords it over the Asgard scenes as the one-eyed Odin. Eventually, Thor and leading lady Jane gravitate to each other, but the film dwells on family woes more than romantic woo.""Thor"" opens in Puente Antiguo, New Mexico. Astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman of ""Black Swan""), her mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd of ""Good Will Hunting""), and their wiseacre assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings of ""Defendor"") are in the middle of nowhere at night searching for an atmospheric anomaly. Foster collides with somebody when they plunge into a storm-like phenomena. Before we discover who they've struck, the plot propels us back in time to Norway in 965 A.D. Odin has triumphed over the evil Frost Giants, led by King Laufey (Colm Feore of ""Chicago""), in a war to thwart them from conquering Earth. Odin loses an eye and exiles these icy blue bastards to their frozen world of Jotunheim. Furthermore, Odin confiscates the Casket of Ancient Winters that serves as their source of power. Later, as Odin is about to crown Thor, some Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and try to recover the casket. Although Odin dismisses the attempt as a botched effort, Thor wants to wage war on the Frost Giants. Odin and he resort to name-calling, and then Thor with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston of ""Midnight in Paris"") and a quartet of his warrior comrades storm Jotunheim. When Odin learns about Thor's insubordination, he banishes his son to Earth. Thor is hurled into a ""Stargate"" wormhole and hits planet Earth about the same time that Jane slams into him with her vehicle.As superhero movies go, nobody is ever in genuine jeopardy. The combat scenes generate little tension or suspense. Sure, several characters have some close scrapes with death, but nobody dies. Worse, some characters can get away with more than others because Branagh and his writers don't make us privy to their special powers. Watch Loki and you'll see. As villains rate, Loki doesn't amount to much more than a trickster, and Thor never performs anything incredibly cool, like the heroes in ""Iron Man,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" and ""The Fantastic Four."" Specifically, the villains don't pose much of a threat to Jane and her friends.The chief problem with ""Thor"" is the less-than-gripping scripting. If you're a fan of the original Marvel Comics ""Thor"" from 1962, the Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne version shares little in common with ""Journey into Mystery"" #83. Donald Blake is mentioned a few times in the film. In the comic book, Blake discovered a wooden staff. When he smashed it against a rock, the staff became 'Mjolnir.' Miller, Stentz, and Payne dispense with the usual human who masquerades as a superhero, and pick up the thread of the ""Thor"" comics from later incarnations. Unlike most Marvel Comics where the hero suffers from a fatal flaw, Thor has nothing comparable outside of his anger management issues. Once he finds himself separated from his supernatural hammer, he calms down enough to get it back, but he doesn't have to endure much suffering until then. Anybody who can catch ""Thor"" in 2-D will enjoy the experience much more than the 3-D version. As it turns out, ""Thor"" was photographed in 2-D and then converted to 3-D. Not once do you see Thor hurl his celebrated hammer 'Mjolnir' at the camera. Indeed, nothing in the 3-D ""Thor"" flies out at you. More fly-in-your face gimmicks would have bolstered the action quotient of this lackluster effort. Nevertheless, the other special effects are beyond reproach. The otherworldly utopia that constitutes Asgard is a mixture of ""Men-in-Black"" production designer Bo Welch, ""Sleuth"" costume designer Alexandra Byrne and ""Mamma Mia!"" lenser Haris Zambarloukos. Asgard is a visual treat if you like edifices that resemble organ pipes. The African-American sentry guarding the Bifrost, Heimdall (Idris Elba of ""Takers""), seems a little incongruous, but then we live in politically enlightened times. The same holds true for one of Thor's best buddies, Hogun (Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano), who is clearly Asian. Marvel movie fans will be happy to know S.H.I.E.L.D's Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) from the ""Iron Man"" films reprises his role. Natalie Portman has little to do but slam her vehicle into our hero. The best parts of ""Thor"" take place on Earth and the fish-out-of-water story with Thor tangling with modern-day life provides the primary source of comic relief. Altogether, ""Thor"" could have been more.","

"xamtaro","29 April 2011","Blockbuster season thunders in with ""THOR"", the marvel studios live action comic book adaptation based on Norse Mythology. In a sprawling tale of Gods and Monsters, Marvel studio crafts a realistically human story in the vein of the critically acclaimed ""Iron Man"".Stripping away years of convoluted continuity and multiple interpretations, the creative team has combined the best of Thor's comic book incarnations to deliver a film that is both easily accessible to the casual watcher and pleasing to the hardcore comic fan. The only ones it might not please are die hard purists of Norse Mythology, for this is not their noble Viking God of thunder. Marvel's Thor is a proud pompous muscle man with a chip on his shoulder. In his eagerness to prove his might, he shattered a truce between his home realm of Asgard and the dreaded Frost Giants. For his actions, Thor is banished to earth in hopes that his exile would teach him humility and the value of life. Lo and behold, it is revealed that this turn of events was just the first step in a grand scheme by Thor's brother Loki, whose hidden agenda and ambiguous allegiance fuels much of the plot's intrigue. On earth, Thor is found and befriended by Jane Foster and her science team while his hammer, Mjolnir ends up in the possession of the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. In order to return to Asgard, and before he can retrieve his hammer, Thor must first prove himself worthy of his power.Melding magic and science fiction with comedy and drama, the movie's first strength is in its narrative. It has spectacular special effects but never relies solely on that. Behind the top notch computer graphics beats a story about pride before the fall, about themes as basic as sibling jealousy and about some very human ""Gods"". Although blessed with skill and power, Thor, Sif, Loki and The Warriors three never act like immortal deities. They are like Childhood friends, like regular people. They get angry, they laugh, they squabble and they each have their own little quirks that make them memorable. If not for the computer generated scenery and stylish costumes, one would easily forget that these are mythological gods. Though it might seem a bit rushed at points and slow at others, the many plot threads are easy to follow and tie up nicely by the end.Thanks to a top notch cast, the acting is spot on though Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins (the two more well known stars) seem under utilized as Jane Foster and Odin respectively. The highlight is definitely Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki like an actor playing an actor. You never know if Loki's words are truth or more trickery for all the world is Loki's stage and every of his acts is a performance to advance some scheme.The sharper ones in the audience would no doubt notice similarities between the Thor and Iron Man movies. Both feature a protagonist who is full of himself until he gets taught a lesson, humbles down and decides to fight for the good of humankind, both protagonists have issues with their father, both encounter a threat from within their own ranks and both face off against giant machines in a climatic final battle. Thankfully these similarities are only fleeting. Both Thor and Iron Man also benefit from a good deal of well written humor which in Thor's case involves the banished deity trying to adapt to human life. Much hilarity ensues.Humour aside, the most important factor for a summer blockbuster is good action. In that regard, Thor delivers with wild abandon complemented by a remarkably glorious soundtrack by Patrick Doyle. Doyle is no stranger to modern magical mythology movies, having scored the likes of Eragon and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Like the music, the film embraces its over-the-top comic book roots, as seen in the amazing production design and costumes. But while the action is big and poised to satisfy the adrenaline craving summer blockbuster crowd, director Kenneth Branagh seems to have become enamored with the ""Michael Bay School of Camera-work"". Tight close ups and shaky-cam neuter the otherwise epic battles. Action scenes like the flashback of Odin's war, or Thor and his friends' fighting their way through a Frost giant ambush, all lack a sense of scale and scope. Couple that with an ending that feels too abrupt and one gets the feeling that this is not the best that a ""Thor"" movie could have been, that Marvel is holding out on the audience, saving the best for later.Will lightning strike the same spot twice? Will marvel pull off another blockbuster as successful as Iron Man? If the abrupt conclusion of Thor is anything to go by, Marvel seems more interested in generating publicity for their 2012 ""Avengers"" movie. And that is exactly what this movie feels like, a set up for something bigger on the way.","

"RossRivero99","2 April 2017","Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"" is one of the best movies that MARVEL comics has ever made along with he other franchises that they have done and practically strikes the right chords every time, and is directed by a man who at the time was very inexperienced with making these types of movies. The movie stars Chris Hemsworth who is perfectly cast as Thor (who also happens to be my second favorite hero in the MARVEL universe) who is the Norse god of thunder, and lives in a realm known as Asgard. Thor is also a man who believes in doing the right thing but sometimes he also lets his morals get to his head a little too often. Thor's father is a god the vikings would pray to named Odin (Anthony Hopkins) who is married to Frigga (Rene Russo), and they only have another child who is very similar to Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus in ""Gladiator"" (2000) and is obsessed with ruling Asgard, who happens to be Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is the god of mischief. Later as the film progresses we see Thor get exiled from Asgard for talking disrespectfully to his father and he sees himself on earth and then goes on a rampage and is then taken in by SHIELD agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) for questioning. After the interrogation is over he meets a young woman named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who is with her family just so that they can get to know who Thor is, and during that time his personality changes from being less arrogant to being a lot more caring towards humans who he previously felt were inferior to him. The visual effects in this movie were breathtaking to see and not only is Hemsworth perfectly cast but Hopkins is as well and deliver fine performances, along with Portman, Russo, and Hiddleston, but as well as Idris Elba as Heimdall, and Stellan Skarsgard as a teacher. But however even though the movie is very good the only thing that prevents it from being great is a routinely frequent problem with MARVEL movies is that some times they really don't get the costumes right which is the case with Thor's costume even though they nailed most of it they just forgot his winged helmet even though this isn't really a major problem for me. Even though this isn't a perfect superhero movie it is one of the best movies that MARVEL and their creator Stan Lee have ever come up with and is one of the best superhero movies of 2011 and of this decade.","

"Michael_Elliott","27 April 2012","Thor (2011) *** (out of 4) After going against his father's wishes and starting up a war, the arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is sent to Earth by his father (Anthony Hopkins) but while he's gone his brother turns enemy and tries to destroy the kingdom. While on Earth Thor meets a young scientist (Natalie Portman) who tries to understand where he comes from. I will admit that I've never read a single Thor comic and I'll admit that I find a lot of these comic movies to be rather bland with more action than brains. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film but I will admit that I was really confused when I learned that someone like Kenneth Branagh was going to be directing. Well, color me shocked to nearly my death because this is actually a pretty solid movie that has some brains, plenty of action, great characters and some wonderful special effects. I was really caught off guard by the screenplay being able to make some interesting characters and this covers everyone from Thor to his father, the scientist, her friends and just about everyone else in the story. It's strange but I found even the smallest of the supporting characters to be people you could connect with and this certainly helped the story. I also thought the performances were extremely well by everyone involved. The arrogance that Hemsworth was able to bring the part was pitch perfect and I thought Portman was fun and believable in her bit. It certainly doesn't hurt when you've got someone like Hopkins giving it his all. Rene Russo is pretty much wasted in her brief role but it was still nice seeing her. I've always said that I'm not a fan of CGI because more often than not it just looks so fake to me that I have a hard time getting caught up in the world it's trying to create. That wasn't the case here because I thought the picture was visually stunning. The opening bit with the space travel looked amazing and I thought the director did a remarkable job at blending the CGI with the story so that it was never distracting. THOR is certainly one of the better comic book adaptations out there.","

"TheHonestCritic","13 July 2022","""Thor"" (2011), up until the first announcement for this movie, I had no idea that the comic book superhero Thor existed. So, when I went to go see this film in the theater, I had literally no idea what to expect. In some cases, that can make the first viewing experience even more enjoyable. That's the case for ""Thor""! When I went to see this movie, I was hooked right from the beginning to end. Since I enjoyed it so much in the theater, I thought it was just a fluke and that my excitement for it would soon fade away. Nope, when I eventually bought it on DVD and watched it a second time, I loved it just as much, if not more than I did the first time I saw it. ""Thor"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, a well-meaning but arrogant god named Thor is banished from his realm, Asgard, by his father, Odin, and then sent to live on Earth to grow up. At first I thought, ""oh, here we go, it's just going to be yet another fish-out-of-water scenario."" Now that being said, one of the most commonly used attributes in the world of cinema is easily the best and funniest part of this film. Watching Thor, a god try to adjust to human life in our world is hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. Plus, there's an intertwining storyline where his brother Loki is trying to become King of Asgard, like him taking place, which makes the whole plot all the more intriguing. I won't go into any extra details about the storyline. But, let me assure you, it's a story you'll remember for the rest of your life. It's a cohesive balance of action, comedy and it also has a lot of great morals thrown in as well, that give it that much more heart and emotion to the plot. As for the acting, it's phenomenal from the whole entire cast. They all do fantastic in this movie! But, the shining stars here, in my opinion, are Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as the villainous Loki and Anthony Hopkins as Odin. They really make this film, and the three of them give the whole cast such a strong chemistry! Had someone else been cast as either of the characters, then it may not have worked. Every single actor and actress nail their roles and fire on all cylinders! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give this film an amazing atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming in New Mexico! But, my personal favorite set is Asgard. That whole location is stunning, and exciting to look at on the screen! As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, since it came out in 2011! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Patrick Doyle is exceptional. His film score sets the perfect tone for the storyline and helps bring the movie to life. My personal favorite song in the soundtrack, and one of the best sequences in the film is the end credits. Those end credits accompanied by that big score, simply make it exhilarating. It's easily one of my top ten favorite end credit sequences of all-time. Props to you, Patrick Doyle! ""Thor"" is nothing but perfection in the genre of superhero movies. I could watch it over and over and not get tired of it! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Thor"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go check it out today! It's such a shame that the ""Thor"" sequels are trash and don't hold a candle to this one. Yet, for some reason, people consider ""Thor"" to be one of the weakest films in the saga. Why? Are you really that selfish? ""Thor is a fantastic movie, and you should consider re-thinking your opinions. Any way, go see ""Thor"" today. Or else, Odin might banish you!","

"johnnymacbest","8 May 2011","The big bad boy of Asgard swings a mighty force of reckoning in cinema with the release of Thor, based on the Marvel comic character of the same name. With so many great performances from the Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston, and of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Thor is thundering with acting and suspense.I can't tell you how much I like this film. There are so many parallels to religious and even familiar territory that's covered in another well-known Superhero flick such as Superman. The beginning of the film is somewhat similar to that of Superman. But whilst the Man of Steel is an alien, Thor, on the other hand, is the son of an Norse god. That's where the similarities end for Thor is set in a mystical and real world with it's own characters and dangers that Thor comes into conflict and contact with.I can't say that I'm familiar with Norse mythology. I'm quite certain that this film takes several liberties from it's mythical background on which it's based. But that alone should not deter anyone from seeing this film and Thor is a worthy addition to an already stellar lineup of films based on Marvel's comic properties; namely that of Spider-Man, X-Men, and Iron Man on which Thor is rightly on par with.Speaking of Norse mythology, I can't quite understand why some are in uproar of the casting of Idris Elba as Heimdall. Even though I'm not familiar with the comic, or Norse mythology, I do know that Heimdall is a Norse god who is white. In my mind, Idris Elba does a wonderful job in his portrayal of one of Thor's most trusted allies. Similarly, this dates back to Daredevil(another film based on the Marvel character) when Michael Clark Duncan was chosen to play the Kingpin, whose background was that of Anglo-European descent. I have no qualms over who portrays these characters as long as they deliver the goods, but overall, Elba did a great job and in that regard, Heimdall is a force to be reckoned with.Natalie Portman has been quite busy this year; what with her recent outstanding performance in Black Swan, she adds another dimension of charm and love as Thor's love interest. Essentially the ""Lois Lane"" of Thor, she is the only human companion our fabled hero has. As hard as it was for Thor to adjust to the daily conumdrums of our world, she's there to help him alleviate some of the muck he has to wade through. I couldn't think of anyone else for the role other than Portman. She's simply great. But it is Tom Hiddleston who really steals the show as Loki, the bad boy of Asgard. Like Heath Ledger's Joker, Hiddleston will no doubt be talked about among comic fans and moviegoers alike with his sinister personality and brash arrogance towards Thor and their conflicts with each other are just....thundering.With all this added up, Thor is simply one of the best comic-book movies of this year. They(Marvel) took another obscure superhero and turned him into a force to be reckoned with at the box-office. See it on Imax to get the full effect of this smash hit. No doubt you will leave the theater with a thunderous smile on your face.","

"xamsx","21 April 2011","Given his Godly nature, Thor could have easily been the most difficult member of The Avengers to translate to screen. Any fears have soundly been laid to rest though, as Kenneth Branagh and his team have pulled together several interpretations of the character, to create perhaps the most definitive version of Thor yet. Despite a somewhat information laden opening, the backstory of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the family dynamic between his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and jealous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is fantastically realised, in a beautifully architected Asgard. Simultaneously seeming archaic and futuristic, Asgard perfectly fits the film's ideology that magic and science are one in the same, something that I think will translate perfectly as the Marvel films start to more deeply explore the other worldly nature of the Marvel Universe. The marketing boys did a grand job of not letting on just how much of the film is set there and the production team created a breathtaking realm through a combination of CGI, outlandish sets and costumes.The film is at it's best when the father-son triangle relationship is being explored, with Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins all giving very different but equally as impressive performances. Hemsworth's physical, fun loving, but fiery tempered Thor gives the film its heart, particularly during his tenure on Earth, whilst his jealous and manipulative brother Loki, is given layers of depth by Hiddleston, who has created perhaps the most memorable on- screen Marvel villain yet. However, it's Anthony Hopkins' Odin, who steals every scene he is in. Despite his lack of knowledge of the source material, he applies himself to the role using every ounce of his shakespearean nature and overpowers louder performances with a whisper. Much of the supporting cast is never given much time to shine, with Natalie Portman's role being particularly under developed, whilst Sif and the Warrior's Three are entertaining if not particularly memorable. Amongst all of this heartfelt drama, is also a brilliant action blockbuster. You will believe that Gods can fly and the climactic battle between Thor and Loki is better than anything the Iron Man movies produced. And whilst there is the cross-over element as with the other Marvel films so far (including a scene involving a certain archer and the almost obligatory post credits moment), it's nowhere near as jarring and enables Thor to stand on its own two feet. It's just made me that much more excited to see the God of Thunder alongside the rest of Earth's heroes. I only hope that Captain America: The First Avenger is this good.","

"alekspredator87","18 July 2022","It has always been interesting to look at the extraterrestrial and mythical world of Asgard. And such a chance fell to the audience in the 2011 film ""Thor"" by Kenneth Branagh. And cinema immerses us in the world of fiction, which, by the way, turns out to be not fiction, and the world of Asgard is simply more developed than ours. ""And there is no magic, there is a more advanced science."" This is about the thought of Arthur C. Clarke, which is voiced here by the main character Jane Foster.The film is extraordinarily beautiful. The colors are striking in the eyes with their brilliance, especially if you compare the film with the first Captain America. It's very worthy - the ability to show what different worlds are. Tall buildings, a gloss of gold, beautiful asgradtsy. The creators came up with love for every detail.Chris Hemsworth really did a great job with the role. At first, he is the arrogant, self-loving prince of Asgard, confidently defies the ice giants with whom his father Alone has been trying to create a world for a long time. He believes that he has the right to decide his own fate, not noticing that politics is undoubtedly behind his actions. And he may well start a new war. Finding himself on Earth without his powers for this, Thor learns to be a man, begins to understand what and how in the vast world. And the actor successfully shows the evolution of the hero. He is handsome, funny where necessary, dramatic. Great game.Loki, aka Tom Hiddleston, is in no way inferior to Chris. And in many ways even surpasses. The darling of fate, with his motivation of a hunted predator, a deceiver and a cheat. Such is Loki, because fate has decreed so. But already here we see that he is angry, because he is unhappy, he has always been on the sidelines, who was set as an example by his brother. And he's not a villain, but an anti-hero who can't say his word in just one movie.The work of Maestro Anthony Hopkins is wonderful. Dubbing is a good thing, but once I saw a couple of emotional moments where the actor speaks in the original, I realized that dubbing does not convey all the emotions of Odin, all the pain that came to life in him when Thor behaved incorrectly. Hopkins is a real decoration of the cinematic universe.Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman, is good. She feels inner strength, she is purposeful and intelligent, while remaining vulnerable and feminine.The film is replete with beautiful shots, majestic music, a vivid plot, and, most importantly, shows the transformation of the hero from an inveterate buffoon into a real king.""Thor"" is a great example of a film that combines humor, drama, a clever idea, a good example for the younger generation, there is a hero to look up to.8 out of 10.","

She is a warrior from an advanced, almost demi-god genes, so obviously she is powerful. However, instead of putting her in unrealistic situations where with her slender agile frame, she would withstand and overpower a bunch of buffed brutes, she is shown utilizing her agility to her advantage - she sneak attacks a giant robot with a spear in the neck! On top of that she is not obnoxious, pretentious and resentful and the male characters around her aren't made to look weak, so she would look strong. Well done!They handled Jane very well, too. She is a smart, driven scientist AND a young woman at the same time. She has a complex personality, she is brave and gentle, she is believable and natural. Like Sif, she is not obnoxious, pretentious and resentful, and the male characters around her aren't made to look weak or stupid, so she would look strong. There is nothing forced about her, unlike many future incarnations of female characters in the MCU. Well done!Unlike the previous solo hero movies, it is more lighthearted and fantastical, more PG. There is a lot more of a light show feel to it, compared to Iron Man.Still the focus is on the hero, his journey, pain and growth. It is again very much what a super hero movie should be - very entertaining and relatable. The characters are natural and fun, the script is honest and focused on the story, and the story itself makes sense throughout.Compared to the last 2 years of MCU content - miles ahead!Checkout my review with the same title of Iron Man for reference of why I wrote the previous sentence.","

+ Asgard, although not seen much, is well realised.
+ Good to see the trickster Loki not as a grinning, wailing nogooder but as a quiet, manipulative, lost little brother.
+ Cool, trippy sci-fi iconography not seen again until Guardians of the Galaxy.
+ Real life sets are quite well designed to be memorable and interesting and big and layered with lots of background activity.
+ Pre-sitcom Kat Dennings
+ Thor's hammer festival with everybody trying to lift it is kinda apt and funny.
+ Thor's fish out of water story is actually still quite funny. He's a sort of loveable dumb dumb.
+ Tom Hiddleston starts a tragic character arc as a distressed and around royal adoptee.
+ Thor is funny. Ragnarok made it good, but this set it up pretty well.
+ Natalie Portman is also funny and it's good to see her.
+ Cheeky Hawkeye cameo that I forgot about. Useless but I still grinned.
+ I sort of like that there's not some cave-dwelling, stick-wielding bad guy allegory for Osama Bin Laden and that Thor is basically the bad guy even if that makes the third act a little lame and stakeless.
+ ""Son of Coul"".Dutch angles.Rene Russo doesn't have much to do.Cheesy Warriors Three crassly shoehorned in.Action is clunky and messy and not pleasurable.Time jumps and crisscrossing stories are badly paced and screw with a lot of potentially meaningful moments.Effects are very dated.CGI backgrounds are depthless and unconvincing stages and wastelands.Chris Hemsworth's accent is a little off.Loki's plan is a little unclear here and there hard to follow.Odinsleep is an incredibly handy plot device/deus ex machina.Post-credits sequence review: 4/5. An actual coda scene again. Shows the trickster and the link set up for Selvig to lead in to the start of the Avengers. Makes little actual sense but in retrospect links the movies nicely.Stan Lee as: Old Man that drives truck trying to pull Thor's hammer out. ""did it work?"" 1/5: Surprising but a bit generic.

"jprslattery","21 May 2011","This film was one of the most tedious experiences of my life. I enjoy a good cheesy action film like the next guy and was genuinely looking forward to a mindless 90 minutes of fun. What I actually experienced was self important, overly buff, lord of the rings reject extras spouting some of the worst lines in film history. How Natalie Portman, let alone Stellen Skarsgard, got roped into this I will never know. Repetitive actions scenes, awful editing that cut the middle of conversations and light humour from Thors friends (puke) and the terrible Kat Dennings made for a challenging viewing experience all round. Where Iron Man went so right with its self depricating humour and quick wit Thor has languid scenes, flacid romance and wooden character interaction.The picture lacks a decent development of storyline and character which is always difficult when introducing a character with a deep backstory but it has been done so well recently with Batman Begins et al. There is a definite smell of studio meddling in the final cut with some scenes jumping all over the place. Loki (Tom Hiddleson) changes from loyal brother/Son to evil traitor with no story or character development. Anthony Hopkins spends most of the film in a coma. Chris Hemsworth can't be to blame for a film which seems over produced, over edited and that was marketed as Return of the King but was more Masters of the Universe. The decision to assign 'Ice Giants' (yes Ice Giants) as 'baddies' falls flat as they are about as scary and menacing as frosty the snowman.The whole project felt a thin and is so poorly put together you could see it unravel before your eyes. Fingers crossed for a better Summer Blockbuster in the near future...","

All the fight scenes happened to fast and you could barely see it if you watch it in 3D, all the female characters are portrayed as useless idiots and if you haven't read the comic book this movie will not make any sense. Just don't waste your money. It has ruined my childhood. The plot was strung together very loosely as well. Don't get me wrong, some of the acting was very good. For example, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddlestone really brought this screen to life when they were given time behind Chris Hemsworth and his horribly cheesy acting. The directors could have done so much better. I guess that's what happens when you sell your soul to Disney (Marvel was sold to Disney). What a shame","

"KissKissBangBangV2","7 May 2011","I've known of the super hero Thor for a long time, I didn't gel with the character as a comic book reader in the 80's though The Ultimates version of Thor got me hooked. Again when I heard Kenneth Brannagh was directing I rolled my pretty nerd eyes, again I was to be surprised. I just saw Thor, in 3D, this afternoon, I'm still on a movie high from it and that's why I'm writing this review. I can't remember the last time I left the cinema all buzzed and excited by a movie, actually yes I can it was Avatar, the 1st time I saw a 3D film.Thor is classic story telling done 21 century style, no shame over the Gods and magic, merely they are presented as fact and we accept them as there in the film. The story is exciting, again a simple tale but as Avatar proved tell a simple tale well and you will entertain, no clever story tricks or sneaky twists, merely an entertaining story, which can, in the right directors hands be elevated above what it is.The graphics whilst not perfect look good, some beautiful Asgardian shots and some amazing 3D moments, I love 3D, it's exciting and Thor is the kind of film it would seem made for, sumptuous, beautiful sets, dripping in colour and scope.Helmsworth and Portman share a good chemistry, I could have used some more of them together but that's all to come, the secondary characters are all fine in they serve the story though there are some moments of over acting that seem excess to the scenes, again though it's a new franchise and a first film so all is forgive. Hopkins is understated but obviously great and Hiddleston who plays Loki is excellent, sneaky, relate-able too and not outright evil, more a maker of mischief, as Loki is.I have to stop now as new Doctor Who is about to start, go see Thor you will enjoy it as a fan of the character or as someone adverse or unaware of his greatness.I don't believe in God but I do believe in Thor.","

"dilipbts","7 June 2020","This is a throw-off piece of Marvel fiction that is packed full of clichÃ© and predictability...to a point.I found myself cringing at a lot of the scenes of heroism and there's a definite stink of pure cheetos-stained fanboyism in many of the scenes in general, with the usual over-the-top ""glory"" of this old four-color trope.But certain things caught my attention as well-done.First, Asgard is absolutely beautiful. They went all out in making a realm of metallic and elemental grandeur. I had no trouble in buying this as the realm of Asgard, the ultimate land of beautiful heroism. In particular, the rainbow bridge, the weaponry, and the interior scenes were very fitting in general style and specific detail. Very impressive visually and even thematically.Second, Branagh's touch can be seen with Shakespearean flair in the family of Odin the AllFather. Odin himself is brimmed with both the rime of age and the wisdom that comes with it and yet his voice can instantly summon fearful authority. Hopkins does well with that balance, even through some cheesy scripting.And the brothers... the sibling rivalry here is very very potent in that it is nuanced and fully realized by both actors. There is love there, but also a lack of understanding, envy, and hate. Loki is far from a cardboard villain, in that we see, all in one package - a fighter who protects his allies, an honest counselor, a liar, a cautious thinker, a smooth tongue, and an awkward one. He loves and reveres his father, but comes to almost fatally doubt him and even hate him...but it's all very real and very stirring. And even when it's clear that he's done very grim deeds, you can actually understand and accept his motives...and his last scene in the film brings all three of the family men together in a very poignant moment of utter loss.I was pretty surprised how moving this all was, especially when put in the middle of some otherwise-uninspiring hero pablem.So in summary, this movie both met my negative expectation of disappointment and surprised me with some purely moving content. See it to see if it surprises you at all as well, and forget the whole comic-book hero thing, since that's been done far better.Thanks for reading.","

I love Norse mythology and all the gods and demigods and other characters from those aforementioned legends and I had only heard about Thor as a comic book, but it was cool. Anthony Hopkins as the leader of Asgard; Odin himself. One of my favorite Norse gods. Some of the characters were a little hard to follow but this was the first time in a long while I had seen Rene Russo, who played Odin's wife Frigg. She did very well. Lots of action and Loki, the mischief-maker of Asgard himself, steals the show. I'd never even heard of Tom Hiddleston until this movie, but he seems very cool. If you're looking for a movie to watch before tackling the Avengers saga, start here, along with Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and the others. Tell them I sent you.","

This is the reason why I have a good hunch of which movies were very memorable and which ones were easily forgettable. This one here, however, comes under the same category as I'd put Guardians of the Galaxy under: It's memorable and forgettable at the same time. The only thing I remember from this movie is how awesome Loki was and Stan Lee's cameo appearance, but other than that, well, let's just say it all jumped over my head.It's quite surprising to see how Thor has changed so much since the time we first saw him. Since I am writing this review 4 years after Thor: Ragnarok, I think my idea of Thor has changed a lot by now. Earlier I used to think Thor can never be an interesting character, thanks to this movie. But after seeing what Ragnarok, Infinity War and Endgame did to him, it seems the entire fault was of this movie's director. He made Thor a weird looking guy. Although there's no doubt everyone looks straightup ugly in this movie, the CGI is actually pretty good.The story is pretty much straightforward: Thor has done a battle which he ruined because of his pompousness and so he has been banished on earth. His hammer has been put at some construction yard or something, and he's no longer worthy enough to lift it. It seems a lot like a copy of the first Assassin's Creed game, since there also AltaÃ¯r was the one whose post was stripped and he was sent back to the beginner's ranks. Meanwhile Loki found out he belonged to the enemy demon race and Odin had adopted him after killing his father. Loki teams up with those demons to attack Asgard.The CGI, I'd admit, is pretty good. Every time I see the Asgard road I always feel like driving a sports car on it. Humans were really boring. All they did was talking, talking and more talking. This isn't something that one'd expect from MCU, and that's pretty obvious since MCU wasn't even decided until this point. But still there should have been a good tone. The twist in the end where Loki decided to save Odin and kill the monster after the monster mentioned Loki helped him was pretty good. I had always wanted a villain to do this: Don't leave yourself vulnerable after being exposed; try to defend yourself and show that the person is lying. And after Loki lost the battle, he pretended to commit suicide in order to show that he only wanted what he believed was justice.Thor may have been a very forgettable movie, but I do remember it wasn't worth watching the second time. This movie made me fear that MCU could be boring in the future. It also ruined Thor's entire expectations for me. Throughout the movie I was only hoping it would end. The only reason I've given it a good rating is because of Loki, the CGI, and the way they were able to show Asgard's culture. Good movie, but a one time watch.","

"lasttimeisaw","18 May 2011","I don't know it is only in China or not, the English version is 2D only here, the 3D version is exclusively Chinese-dubbed, I cannot figure out whether this maneuver is supposed to promote the 3D or 2D (a quite stupid one though), but I had no hesitation to choose the non- dubbed version (latter I would got some delightful news that the so-called 3D version is not worth the pennies). As the starter of the summer Hollywood blockbusters here in China, Thor intricately possesses a singular trait, the actor-turned-director Kenneth Branagh had remained to be an odd option since he was announced as the man behind-the-wheel the this heavy-budgeted vehicle for all cinephiles. How the Shakespeare-addicted Kenneth could on earth create a marvel-labelled popcorn picture? Now the wait is officially over, I must say the outcome of this incompatible combo tastes quite bland.Compared with other superhero-studded peers, Thor does look a bit shabby, the setting of the land of all Gods is mainly covered in a monochrome dark hue, which is nothing near splendid and in lack of any virtual existence, lavish but kitsch (3D glasses also cannot help). The earth set, on the other hand, the seediness is ubiquitously, no spectacular scene to satisfy my eyes, everything happens in a tiny desert town with a dozen of extras, running and screaming.The essential bedrock of the film centers on the father-son battle, which is Kenneth's stunt, but in a cartoonish way unfortunately, Kenneth may have exerted himself fully to balance the duel between money and art, however, in my opinion, he failed to achieve both.As for the cast, Just as I expected, nothing noteworthy, the only two exceptions, alongside Sir Anthony Hopkins is Tom Hiddleston, who unexpectedly devoted a feminine but not campy existence as the villain Loki, however, this film surely doesn't worth their talent. (Sorry, but I am intentional to leave out the new Oscar winner Natalie Portman here, I find her part might be the weakest amongst all).","

Asgard is presented as this imponent, magnificent place and it manages to have that vibe with all the other characters. The relationships the characters have is awesome, specially Thor, Loki and Odin. The story is pretty good, is simple but really engaging. Maybe my favourite movie from Marvels Phase 1. I really wish they kept Thors vibe from this movie to the future ones instead of making him a joke.","

"x_manicure_x","14 August 2021","Thor is a mediocre and flat movie but offers good visuals and an interesting setting. I expected it to be just a bunch of silly action scenes and flamboyant effects, but they even tried to put some plot and setting in it. I just wished the writing was not so sappy and naive, did they hire a thirteen-year-old to do the script? Thor's relationship with Jane and the other human characters is so forced and simplistic, all characters are one-dimensional and add no value to the movie. It does not look like their affection grew through the experiences they shared together; they just spend a night under the stars to realize they are soulmates. I guess the whole thing is supposed to be about Thor's growth as a character, but again there is no development whatsoever: the arrogant and reckless kid suddenly changes into a big-hearted superhero, just because the story requires him to. Wait, maybe finding true love is what changed him all of a sudden? Please. Him trying to adapt to the human world was kind of fun though.","

"IgiS","30 April 2011","I highly recommend ""Thor"" to anyone willing to go on this type of escapist journey, which was prepared clearly as a fun inducing devise. It has all of those elements of good Marvel film. It is colorful, full of great CGI(3D really gets it job done well this time), deprived of unnecessary weight on plot(it is rather simple, yet not stupid), and it doesn't overstay its welcome, running just below 2hrs mark(but stay for an extra scene after the credits). Also it features very good performances all around. I was really impressed by newcomer Chris Hemsworth, who played lead role. It was spot on choice to go with him, instead of some more famous face, since he's done his job almost impeccably in a clearly star making role. Other players were very solid also, with beautiful Natalie Portman as main female character, Sir Hopkins in surprisingly long supporting role, and other fine actors(like Ray Stevenson, who was so disguised I only recognized him after the movie). I must say that it is best movie of it's kind since first Iron Man, and definitely in top group of comic book adaptations. Great way to start off summer time in cinemas, and let's just hope that what will follow this season(Transformers 3, Green Lantern, Captain America etc.), will be at least around that good.","

"cherold","17 July 2012","After a slow start, with lots of actors speaking in stiff, we-are-an- ancient-peoples voices, Thor picks up as the vain, arrogant god comes to earth and hooks up with some scientists. But while the movie does get better, it never moves past the mark of a Saturday afternoon time killer. There is some pretty scenery and some nice effects (the fire-shooting armor giant is particularly nicely done), but nothing that raises this above the ordinary.The acting is decent, although Thor's romance with the scientist feels less like true love than like two good-looking people who have fallen in lust, and there's not an ounce of real emotion anywhere in the spectacle. But it's perfectly fine for what it is.","

"hottchillipeppers","30 April 2017","This movie is amazing! The perfect mix between hilariousness and seriousness, this is a MUST watch! I love the way MARVEL incorporated Mythology with modern times. Chris Hemsworth's outstanding performance will catch the eyes of every audience. Alongside with Tom Hiddleston, who's skill in planning Loki could not be outmatched by any other actor. What I love about this film is that it is not the usual American superhero movie, it has a relaxing feel to it, a sense of an English production, something that you cannot find in many movies these days. The story is put together in a lovely way, and Natalie Portman's Jane is played with significance. Darcy is always there to brighten the day, and the link with avengers is intriguing beyond doubt. I often wonderâ€“with the new Thor Ragnarok looking bad, will MARVEL ever be able to capture the quality of this movie ever again.","

"Silberfalke","1 May 2011","Okay: ""Thor"" was not flawless, but I still loved the movie. First of all: despite my doubts, Chris Hemsworth was perfect in his role as the god of thunder. He delivered and so did the rest of the cast. Then there was the great merging of myth and SciFi in the way Asgard was shown. I expected the worst (as I love the Norse mythology and spirituality) and was stunned by the cosmic beauty the makers presented. The visual interpretation of Bifrost and the rainbow bridge was just great. And so was the whole movie, kind of ""old fashioned"" but nevertheless funny, entertaining and with way more soul than a lot of other hero-flicks and recent blockbusters.The special effects were okay and so was the 3-D, even if they added it afterward (like in ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""The Last Airbender""). My favorite 2011 film so far and I really consider, watching it again in the movie theatre , which does not happen that often as I usually wait for a BluRay release...","

"jornevdk","2 May 2011","I just got back form seeing ""Thor"" in my local cinema. First off, big negative to them for ruining the after credits by just stopping it after 10 seconds. So yes, we again have scene after the credits, and yes, I can confirm it's epic (after googeling it), and no, I am (of course) not going to tell you what it is.One small side note for those who read this, I am a huge Marvel fan-boy. I'll try to conceal that and try to be a bit objective. That is even harder for me considering I am of Frisian lineage, meaning, well, lets just say I have a MjÃ¶lnir tattoo and tend to hail to Odin and Thor while raising my drinking horn. Onward to the movie!I expected a fun movie. It's Marvel after all. Lots of special effects, good, decent acting, not to deep of a story. Did I come unprepared. It simply blew me away. Marvel picked up the pace after ""Iron Man"". I liked that one a lot. Then came the new ""Hulk"" which, in my opinion, was also time well spent watching it. ""X-men: Origins Wolverine"" was awesome, be it a bit simple. ""Iron Man 2"" topped all 3 of them. But until now, the ""X-men"" movies have always been my favorite. As said, until now.""Thor"" is everything you would expect from a Marvel movie, and so, so much more. The visuals are stunning. They are by far the best I personally have ever seen in a Marvel movie. They can compete for the first prise with ""Avatar"", and probably win that contest. Everything about it breaths ""epic"". This also goes for the music. Sound and visual blend in perfectly to create an overwhelming experience.But acting is important as well. And it's spot on. It is here that my knowledge of the Northern mythology and stories kicks in. I caught myself comparing the facts I knew with that in the movie. I went in, thinking there might be some references to the Edda, but it was as if Marvel actually took the time to read the book! Yes there are some minor flaws, but nothing that really bothered me (like in other movies, big example being ""Clash of the Titans"", fun action, but just threw entire Greek mythology aside). Odin is spot on. Anthony Hopkins did it 100% perfect. Thor is as he should be; a good hearted, arrogant, slightly dumb, but enjoyable character who loves to drink, fight, drink and fight some more. His one-liners are really worth repeating when drinking with friends(I already warned my mother that she should start buying new coffee cups). The, for me, relatively new actor Chris Hemsworth just made it in to my ""I want to see more of him""-list. Same goes for Loki. He might not have noticed it, but I think the Trickster took over a part of Hiddleston's body during the shooting of this movie. And last but definitely not least, a special notice for Idris Elba. Heimdall is simply awesome. Only a view lines for him, but he makes them count, for two! It's to bad that the other actors fade away in the background next to the 3 leading actors. Their performance is solid, they do what they have to do, but nothing more. This is also caused by the fact that their characters only reach a moderate amount of debt. That is about the only remark I have on the movie. The debt of the supporting role's. The effects are breath taking and the references to the North religion is kept spared, even honored from my personal point of view. The action and special effect that come with them are, as said, epic. You all know the feeling when you watch a terrific movie scene, or listen to an awesome song. The goose bumps, the water in your eyes, the smile on your face. I've had it a view times during different movies, I always get it when listening to a new ""Amon Amarth"" CD or track, but I never experienced it multiple times as I did during this movie. I ask you to stay a while and watch the beautifully animated ""Yggdrasil"" during the end credits. I thought it was breath taking.-Marvel fan boy (like me)? MUST SEE! -Viking/Norse saga/mythology fan/believer (like me)? Set aside the fact that it is Marvel, and you'll see an homage to our Gods yet unseen.I'm rating it with 8 stars, because 9 and 10 is the region where, i.m.o, the movies with the deep stories and characters belong. That's the only reason. I think it is the best Marvel movie existing at this moment, and if they keep it up at this level, I can't wait to see what the future movies (""First Class"", ""Capt America"", ""The Avengers"") have in store for us.","

"bowmanblue","25 August 2014","Who'd have thought the - not particularly well-known - Marvel comic book hero, Thor, would have transferred so well to the big screen? Most people are pretty familiar with Superman, Batman etc, but it takes a little more digging to know about the 'God of Thunder.' He's the son of king Odin and, on the day he is destined to ascend to the throne himself, sets off a chain of events which sees him banished to - guess where - Earth! There, he must learn to not act like quite such an insufferable oaf and sort his head out.And, watching him do so is damn good fun. The film's main brilliance is Thor (or Christ Hemsworth) himself. He plays someone who is way too big for his God-like boots. However, despite being a bit of a puffed-up idiot, he remains likable at all times. You'll root for him whether he's wiping out Frost Giants, or getting in touch with his sensitive side while wooing the unfeasibly-attractive scientist he meets on Earth (hello, Natalie Portman).If you like action, if you like adventure, or if you just want a brilliantly silly film to rest your mind to, this one is it. If you have a sense of fun, whether you know about the 'Marvel Universe' or not, you really should find something you like here.Also, kudos to director Kenneth Brannah for getting involved with this - he's clearly more than just a thespian actor in tights!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","

"DonaldDooD","24 July 2014","Thor's 77% on Rotten Tomatoes is the #1 reason why I don't try out Marvel movies. I'm willing to see popcorn-only films, but Thor is so average, the action doesn't cover up the bland characters and pandering plot.The deepest characters are barely two dimensional. You never get to sense Loki's deep envy of Thor, and Thor's only defining trait is arrogance. There is potential for Thor to grow up, but he never matures. He is punished for breaking the peace...but is forgiven for being heroic, a trait he never lacked. This is not how character arcs work!And they're the most developed characters of the film. Anthony Hopkins literally sleeps through most of the movie. Sif and ""The Warriors Three"" are one dimensional, forgettable, wastes of time. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s inclusion is pointless, and the trio of human characters Thor hangs out with only subtract from the film. Kat Dennings only delivers ""funny"" quips, and the romantic subplot with Thor and Natalie Portman's character is as forced as they get. There's more romantic chemistry in Marley and Me. The only character I could get behind was Heimdall. Idris Elba keeps ending up as the strongest actor in character-weak films. But Heimdall serves little purpose beyond his role as gatekeeper.If you really like comic books, I suppose the action is okay, but I was never amazed, nor amused by camp. I can't believe it doesn't get called out for its terrible script more often. Its just another Hollywood action flick that doesn't even pull of the tropes well. We deserve better than this.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7 May 2011","Looking at the whole of the Marvel universe, Thor would have to be the black sheep. For one thing, he's the Norse god of thunder. His world â€” the realm of Asgard â€” is completely foreign to us, as is most Norse mythology. Greek mythology, maybe, but definitely not Norse. As for the hero himself, similar to Superman, he possesses inherent power and immortality and wields as brute an arrogance as his mighty hammer. In other words: hard to identify with and hard to like. Yet under Kenneth Branagh's direction, the worlds of magical legend and that of the contemporary superhero manage to find a common ground through humor and relatable themes of familial conflict. Channeled through Chris Hemsworth's bravado and highly aware performance, ""Thor"" manages to stand tall as a hero's journey among all else, a trait that serves as its saving grace.Bouncing back and forth between Asgard and modern day New Mexico, ""Thor"" tells the story of how the young arrogant king-to-be of Asgard reignited a long-ended war between his people and the evil Frost Giants and was therefore banished to Earth by his father Odin (Hopkins). Now a mortal on Earth, Thor seeks to reclaim his power and the throne with the help of an astro-physicist (Portman), while his younger brother Loki (Hiddleston) plans to secure his own place as ruler.Thor's personal quest as well as the conflict between him, his father and Loki provide the film's true lifeblood. The three give the film's best performances, and though familial treachery rates far from original storytelling, there's a reason these Shakespearean plots have been around forever. Hiddleston thrives here as the story's most complex character, which is a title more often given to someone other than the villain in a superhero film. His transformation from untrustworthy worm to full-on bad guy feels complete thanks to the way Hiddleston seizes every moment of screen time.But that doesn't mean he overshadows our golden-maned hero. Hemsworth shows a definitive comfort as a leading man, happily commanding the attention that ought to be demanded of an actor playing a god. It helps that he's 20 different kinds of jacked and therefore physically appropriate for the role, but he shows surprising depth. In the Jotunheim (Frost Giants' planet) sequence, the one that gets Thor in trouble with Dad, he infuses a childish innocence into his untempered pride, and we become more apt to root for his predestined change of character rather than despise his arrogance. Although the writers give him one too many shouts of ""Noooo!"" during the film, he makes it convincing, especially when he comes to the realization that he simply cannot take back his hammer, Mjolnir, or his powers through simple use of force.Speaking of force, Hemsworth makes the grade as an ass-kicker without a doubt, yet the action sequences leave a bit of something to be desired in terms of excitement and creativity. But while Branagh might not be a student of action filmmaking, he never loses sight of what's at stake. The writers have ensured that the action sequences feel necessary rather than like needless fluff; the tension of the story keeps the fights engaging and Branagh retains focus on the characters involved.The element of the script that will divide opinion the most will likely be its humor. Kat Dennings' character carries the brunt of the comic relief as Darcy, an intern for Portman's Jane Foster and Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd's Erik Selvig. Sometimes it goes a bit too far, but I would almost label her as crucial: she helps keep ""Thor"" from getting too serious to be taken seriously. ""Thor"" contains a lot of talk about magic, science and rainbow bridges; it helps to have a character that takes all of it lightly and also breaks the rhythm of what would be an all-too-typical ""girl meets boy fallen from the sky"" love story between Jane and Thor.At the same time, Hemsworth ends up being the funniest of anyone. He doesn't even flinch as he proclaims his enjoyment of a cup of coffee and smashes the mug on the floor demanding another. He doesn't play it up for laughs or try and act confused by why it's not acceptable behavior: he lets it be part of who he is. Branagh and the script also do a nice job using humor to break the awkwardness that occurs when the Warriors Three and Sif (Asgard's best fighters) come to Earth looking for Thor. Their extravagant costumes look simply awful out of the context and set design of Asgard that one of the film's pivotal action sequences that follows would've lost all sense of credibility without some self-aware humor. Considering the potential for ""Thor"" to be a laughingstock in this manner, it's actually impressive how well Branagh, cast and crew handled the clash of fantasy and reality. The only significant chunk of the film that didn't quite hit was the love story. Despite being excellent in the role, Portman had no reason to take the part of Jane Foster. She's criminally underused in the film and rather one-dimensional. She cares about her life's work and is smitten with Thor. Their scenes together are nice, but hardly serve to up the stakes when Thor returns to Asgard for the final showdown. My curiosity for a ""Thor"" sequel definitely hinges more so on wanting to see Asgard and its realms more fully realized than wanting to know whether Thor and Jane can keep their flame alive despite being worlds apart.But no matter how many misfires you can find in certain aspects of the film, its devotion to its core conflict and character arcs helps make everything more entertaining. The plot of ""Thor"" remains simple and pure; a lesson in humility that few summer blockbusters are ever willing to learn.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","

In my view this is one of the worst marvel films; no, one of the worst super-hero films ever made. The plot is so shallow - I know it is based on the comic, I know... - the hairdos are awful, the roles are as clichÃ©-ed as it gets, I could go on. And I will. On what basis does Portman fall for Thor? And on what basis does Thor fall for Portman? Also, the only reason that Thor and Loki engage in battle is that the latter threatened to kill the mortal woman that Thor is so in love with for no apparent reason? Don't people usually hold screenings for movies? How did this one make it to the theaters? Did anyone actually went and saw it? This is an insult to Scandinavian mythology; so much so that I believe it should be banned from theaters worldwide. I mean, come on... really? Really?!","

"The_big_mick","6 May 2011","As a big comic fan, I understand that movies cannot be based exactly on events in the comics-its not very practical. Some say that this takes away from the story, and the movie is never as good as the comic itself. That being said, I really enjoyed Thor and it was a lot of fun. Being a comic reader, I like the little things the writers threw in as a little nod to the fans, like Thor inquiring about the name tag on the shirt Jane Foster gave him, and how it said Donald Blake, and she claimed it was her ex. Really liked the inclusion of the Warriors Three as well. But what impressed me the most was that everyone was really good in their roles! Chris Hemsworth was quite good as the cocky, yet brash God of Thunder. Tom Hiddleston portrayed the deceitful God of Mischief Loki very well, too. Anthony Hopkins was great as the wise and proud Warrior King Odin. Very good character choices, I thought.I was also quite pleased that the feelings Jane Foster and Thor had for each other was kept as a small plot point instead of taking a much larger role. They kept things focused on Thor and trying to return to Asgard, as they should have. Well done.Problems? Well, only a couple of minor things, really. They really should have explained what the Odinsleep was, because without knowing about it from reading the comics, a normal movie goer would have just seen Odin collapse, and then be told he couldn't continue on as the King of Asgard because he was ""in the Odinsleep"". Considering that being in the Odinsleep was the whole basis for Loki becoming King and thus causing a lot of the plot to commence, it really did bear some explanation. Also, I found that some of the fights were rather short. They were good, but when you see Thor, Loki, Sif and the Warriors Three take on a ton of Frost Giants and beat them pretty easily, and those are supposed to be some of the big villains in the movie, it kinda makes you take them less serious. Same with Destroyer. I was so stoked that he was in this movie: in fact, it was probably what I was most excited for. He decimated Sif and the Warriors Three, and then gives Thor a good smack, and then suddenly Mjolnir returns to Thor and Thor beats Destroyer in about 2 minutes. And the same happened to Loki. Loki manipulated everyone, masterminded the whole plan about getting the Frost Giants into Asgard through a secret passage and was playing both sides against the middle. He starts taunting Thor, and then when Thor finally fights him, the fight lasts about 5 minutes. A couple of blows back and forth, Loki makes some mirror images of himself and then its pretty much over. Had they made at least some of the fights go on a bit longer, particularly Loki, it would have gone a long way towards cementing the villains as really worthy opponents. At least Destroyer annihilated the Warriors Three and Sif, which made him seem pretty damn worthy, but Thor turning around and beating him pretty easily took away from that, I found.Aside from that, it was an entertaining film. There are lots of laughs to be had, (particularly the fish out of water type, as Thor has no clue how to properly act on Earth), the acting is very solid and the story is pretty good.","

I haven't read the comic so i cant say whether it was like it but i enjoyed it personally. Some of the scenes were visually amazing. The fight scenes were very good as well.I am a fan of most marvel films so this one did not disappoint. I felt the film told you enough of the story as well.

"jedi10-682-101769","11 May 2011","Thor is a weird character even in the Marvel comic universe, he feels a little out of place compared to the super science of the X-Men, FF, Spiderman and others. Yet, comic fans been attracted to this weird tale of Gods and Monsters since the 1960s. Marvel made great decisions with the director, cast and production. Kenneth Baranaugh creates Asgard as though it was ripped from Hamlet or King Henry V with a sense of wonderment of olden times. Chris Hemmolth is awesome as Thor. As dead on RDJ was Tony Stark, Chris nails Thor which is a much harder role then being a drunk jackass in a metal suit. Hopkins as Odin is a real treat as well.The story does a great job of laying the foundation of the Norse myth with Frost Giants, Loki, the Casket of Winter and the rest of the gods. I loved how they made Thor, the cocky warrior and didn't hold back on how much of spoiled brat he was. Kenneth did a smart move of giving Loki a decent story as well. Instead of being evil upfront, Loki just wanted to ruin Thor's day and through that action realizes he is a monster. All the stuff in Asgard with the Three Warriors and Sif give the movie a good scope.I have heard people complain about the Earth scenes. I disagree to a point, the love story is a bit weak, but they usually are in these movies. Superman, Spiderman and to some extent Iron Man series are really the only ones to nail the love story. It does as Kevin Smith point out that Jane is just lusting for Thor and his hammer. Thor fighting Shield was great as was the Hawkeye cameo. The humans interacting with Thor was fun which the movie needed to be. I also disagree with the assessment Thor's redemption was quick. Thor's redemption starts with Loki lying about Odin's death that breaks him. Its a subtle bit which most audience would miss. Plus, he was willing sacrifice his life when he had no way of knowing he would be brought to life. So, I am OK with the redemption story.The end was a nice touch of destroying the Rainbow bridge. I did not see that coming at all consideirng how important it is in the comics. As good as the end was, the after credit scene was balls. Fury with the briefcase was a nice nod to Pulp Fiction as well as nice Usual Suspects ending of Loki maybe being the human doctor all along. This was a great start for the summer and what I thought would be the giant speed bump for Avengers has turned out to be more gas on the pedal. Bring on Cap and GL.","

"jonconnormustlive-46298","16 April 2019","Thor introduces the God of Thunder and his mischievous brother Loki to the MCU.The Good: Chris Hemsworth gives a likeable performance as Thor.
The opening scenes set in Thor's homeworld are visually dazzling and entertaining.The Bad: Natalie Portman gives a HORRIBLE performance here (and I usually like Portman as an actress).
The supporting cast is forgettable.
The jokes are dreadful.
The romance is forced and just bad.
This film also introduces Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) but doesn't do anything with him. It was so pointless.
Loki was an idiot. The only reason his plot fails is because of his own idiocrasy.Thor delivers us the worst entry in the MCU's Phase 1, thumbs down.","

"calin_hotshot","30 April 2011","Awesome, superb, epic!!! I've yet to see a movie that made me so eager to see it as ""Thor"", I really couldn't wait for the premiere and... I wasn't disappointed, not one bit. The new Marvel movie about the Norse God of Thunder has the potential to become a top 3 best of all time superhero movies. While standing in the theatre and watching it for 2 hours made me feel like only 10 minutes had past since i've sat down, the story sums up pretty much all the essentials of the Mighty Avengers STORY, Hemsworth does a great job as the thunderer , great acting, a lot of charisma, he was cast perfectly,good accent too, excellent performance by Hopkins and an ever more impressive one by Hiddlestone as Loki. Special effects were superb, (Asgard looks amazing)but not forced over the edge, the movie has it's parts that make you laugh and also the fighting scenes are superb and sufficient, I couldn't have wanted more or less! Idris Elba does an excellent Heimdall and personally I loved Jaimie Alexander as Sif. The story really sticks together, Brannagh did a wonderful job from top to finish. Having already seen Iron man 1 and 2 and the Incredible Hulk, and now Thor, the big picture is starting to be clear: can't wait for Captain America! I just want to say AVENGERS! ASSEMBLE! This is my very first review, and I did it because I loved ""Thor""so much and I hope you will too and that this will be helpful!","

"kaden_lewis","12 June 2021","Just like the first three movies in the MCU, this one didn't disappoint. It was a nice change of pace from the regular Earth based stories with scientists making themselves super heroes. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the first three movies, but it was nice to get something a little different. Personally, I would give this movie a 7.6/10, not as good as Iron Man 2, but better than the Incredible Hulk, and Iron Man is better than all of them. I liked how this movie had some decent battles, some good storytelling, and great acting. I though once again that Marvel Studios perfectly casted this movie. I think their gamble of casting two no name actors (Chris Hemsworth, and Tom Hiddleston) at the time to play two of the leading roles really payed off. I though they were great. Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, and Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd all played their roles great, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin, he is just great as anyone he plays. I also thought the final battle of this movie was good. Iron Man 2 still has the best final battle of the first four movies, but this one was pretty good. It was decent in length, and had some pretty good action. The last thing I liked about this movie was that we were introduced to another avenger, that being Clint Barton/Hawkeye. I think he should have had a bigger role than a cameo, but it was still pretty cool.Just like all the Marvel movies so far, I recommend this one. It was great for all people, especially Norse Mythology lovers.","

"the_oak","28 November 2020","I loved this movie when I watched it. I remember I came all pumped up out of the cinema. I don't care about critics who say it's poorly written or that the character development is weak. It is not true or else it would not have such an effect on people. Sure, it could have been more complex and elaborate and intellectual. But this movie is about the relationship between Odin, Thor and Loki and it is powerful, emotional, grand and whoever does not have any family issues in their family can maybe say that the story is bad. Also the story is filled with humor plus there is romance. The special effects and artwork is amazing to boot.
I say well done, and I am one norwegian who walked out of the cinema proud of my heritage.","

"iamthematrix-1","29 April 2011","Thor truly defines the word ""Blockbuster"". It has an abundance of testosterone fueled action, a plethora of mind-blowing special effects, a hint of well-timed humor sprinkled throughout it's 111 minutes running time, and a powerful yet fragile protagonist that you actually care about by the time the credits roll.Hardcore Thor enthusiasts will be fully satisfied with this amazing adaptation of the Asgardian hero, and for the rest of us who have no knowledge or background on the Marvel character, it will still be an enjoyable and unforgettable ride.They cast the role of Thor perfectly, nobody else could have filled his shoes, Chris looks fit and healthy, and exudes the cocky arrogance that is associated with Thor during the first act. The pace doesn't slow down through the second and third acts also, and I was extremely impressed by this. The acting, in my opinion, was top-notch for a comic book adaptation, the only downfall for me was, surprisingly, Natalie Portman as Jane. I didn't really feel the chemistry between her and Chris was electric, and her part almost felt redundant and forced. But that is only a small imperfection in an otherwise perfect film. I highly recommend seeing this film, it lives up to the hype, which is rare for most summer blockbusters, but in the case of The Mighty Thor, thankfully it's true.9/10.","

Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Anthony Hopkins as Oudin were terrific. And the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman seemed genuine. Throw in an engaging story, amazing special effects and an awesome soundtrack, which by the way, was one of the better soundtracks for a comic book movie in recent years, you have a great movie.","

"adrianaling","6 March 2018","Thor is one of my favorite Marvel movies. The characters were fun and the world building was fantastic. I was so excited to see the visual effects that brought Asgard to life. Chris Hemsworth really is the perfect Thor and Tom Hiddleston is perfect for Loki. The only actor that fell short was Natalie Portman. Her acting was very bland and for a top-billed actress she should have put more effort into the character of Jane Foster. It seems that she had become so unlikable that she was written off during Thor: Ragnarok. Thor is the best character in the whole Avengers roster and seeing him on the big screen was a real treat. The plot was a simple hero's journey but the growth and action has made this film even more enjoyable with each viewing. My favorite scene was the battle on Jotunheim because of how great the effects were and the choreography of the fight scenes. It did not feel like they were just actors playing near a green screen. Thor was the first Marvel film to succeed in creating dynamic new worlds that felt as real as the action scenes in New Mexico.Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Fiege brought a lot of comedic and memorable moments that are still referenced in other movies and shows. Truly this has become one of the most iconic films in the past decade and has ushered in the impressive Marvel Cinematic Universe.","

"jzappa","10 September 2011","Nearly half of Thor is set in Asgard, one of the universe's nine ""realms,"" which is reigned over by King Odin. Thor is Odin's oldest son and is therefore entitled to the throne, but he's foolhardy, bigheaded and impetuous, which is why he heads a group of fighters in an anticipatory assault against Asgard's foes, the Frost Giants. For this, Odin takes away Thor's power, which comes from his magical hammer, and expels him to Earth, where he's accommodated by Natalie Portman, in her third decidedly unambitious screen role since her success with Black Swan, an astrophysicist who's in the infancy of hypothesizing the very universal trapdoor through which Thor just came. The biggest shock is that the film is most effective and involving where you would least expect it. One would think that Branagh would do more with the film's unsmiling supernatural constituents and probably labor over its more down-to-earth relief stretches, yet it's precisely the opposite.The tone is unexpectedly good-humored. Baffled as to who he is, Jane imagines that Thor might be extraterrestrial, although her partner Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd is dubious because all the words and names that Thor uses are recognizable to him from his Scandinavian background. Nonetheless, they wind up helping him in his pursuit to reclaim the hammer, albeit double-super-secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D., headed by Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson, known from the Iron Man movies, has located it already. Meanwhile, back in Asgard, Thor's younger brother Loki, who initially seemed to be a level-headed sounding board, is scheming behind Thor's back to guarantee that his exile is eternal and he inherits the kingdom. Given Branagh's qualifications in Shakespeare and literary adaptations, one would assume that the royal and familial plot on Asgard would be the film's highlights, but these scenes are indeed very tedious, and occasionally fairly stilted.Maybe it's due to all the digital sets and backdrops, which are lavishly accomplished but never quite seem palpable, not to mention a whole 'nother century of cinema's worth of dutch angles. Where Branagh genuinely enlivens the film is on Earth, where a light-hearted and even cleverly hilarious streak offsets the take-me-serious histrionic matters. The first half hour of this silly movie is indeed a drag as it's too sanctimonious, but once Thor discovers himself in the deserts of New Mexico, it's priceless, and all the more so as it's so unexpected, to see these very relatable mere mortals look on while he speaks in some sort of imitation-medieval English. ""I need sustenance!"" he proclaims at a small-town diner, shortly before smashing his coffee cup on the floor. And eventually he grasps, rather hilariously, that he's no longer as mighty as he was before, his schooling in modesty and logic assume a valid emotional concentration.Thor, a prince in any case, is chivalrous and reverential of women, but also a hard-drinking, giant-slaughtering conqueror once deified by Vikings. We find ourselves regularly laughing with the movie, for instance at the way he reacts to doctors attempting to take his blood, or how he asks for that second cup of coffee at breakfast. Still, where the movie loses my interest is in that faraway dimension, where the set design's tawdry golden flash envelops the quarrels of the gods---essentially, the swarthy conspirator against the heroic Aryan---comes across as an incessant, uninflected one-note huff. Kat Dennings as Portman's friend discharges some well-delivered lines and then practically evaporates, beautiful bosom and all, but on Asgard, Rene Russo, as Odin's wife-slash-Thor's mother, has one line and nothing else to do.Thankfully, the Shakespearean at the helm manages to inculcate a taste of the Bard's irony. Speaking of which, just because Loki's a hackneyed character doesn't mean young British actor Tom Hiddleston wouldn't make a first-rate Edmund in King Lear: He's better at relating his resentment and jealousy than any evil or wickedness. Thor boils down to nothing more than big laughs, loud and tacky Hollywood action, and a hero who requires suffering the loss of his might before he can truly be mighty. It's a lesser installment in the superhero adaptation bubble, but one that is wonderfully entertaining on its own restricted conditions.","

"francoischristana","20 May 2022","I can understand Loki's dissatisfaction with Odin for not telling him the truth about his origins; imagine discovering the truth while fighting for your life against your own people. Loki had a point; he'd never be king since he wasn't a true Asgardian, which is why Mjolnir selected Thor; it was predetermined, and I believe that's what upset him the most: he'd never have a shot. I'm pleased Thor was sent to Earth to learn to be unselfish and to see that he still has a lot to learn from his father before he is truly ready to rule because he did cause a lot of chaos that had to be restored.","

"mitchell5954","11 November 2017","Thor is the fourth superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. People are somewhat mixed on the film. Some love it, while others do not care for it. I personally really enjoyed this film. I thought Chris Hemsworth was the perfect choice to play for like Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Iron Man. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant like always. Natalie Portman also gives a great performance. The villain is a very cunning and very sympathetic villain. The effects are amazing and the action scenes are awesome.The story is quite simple. Long ago Asghard, led by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) fought an enemy known as the Frost Giants. Asghard won the war. Years later Frost Giants invade Asghard but are thwarted by Odin. Our hero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his friends including his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) invade the Frost Giant homeland and pretty much start another war. For his actions Odin banishes Thor to Earth in order to become a more mature person. There he meets a girl named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her family and because of them gradually grows as a person. Then the main villain Loki sends forces to Earth to kill Thor he needs to regain his powers and defeat him.The story is basically a coming of age story. The story is generic, but sometimes generic works. I for one got invested into the Thor character and enjoyed following him on his journey. The character of Thor is very arrogant and quick to anger in the beginning but not to the point where you do not like him. As the film goes on he becomes more mature and humble and you really believe it.Natalie Portman does a good job here as well. Natalie Portman, in the last five years has truly proved herself as a great actress. She was given a bad name for the longest thanks to the Star Wars prequels. She was pretty bad in those movies, but that was more George Lucas's direction than anything. People say that the stuff on Earth was fairly boring, but it was necessary. The stuff on Earth is there to make Thor grow as a character. Natalie's character was definitely necessary in that. I do agree, however, that the scenes on Earth could have been a bit shorter.The villain Loki is also great. Of all the villains in these Marvel movies in this universe, I think that Loki is the best one, at least in this movie. He is made into more of a generic bad guy in the Avengers, but here you really buy his motivations. You find out that he is actually the son of Asghard's enemy. Plus, Odin always held Thor in higher regard than him and he wanted to prove himself. You do not condone what he does but you see where he is coming from.The effects of this film are great. Though I don't mind the Earth scenes for the most part, I just love when they are in Asghard or in the Frost Giant realm. The CGI is simple beautiful. The action scenes are also great particularly the one where Thor and his friends fight the Frost Giants in their realm in the beginning of the film. I did not see the film in 3D so I cannot comment on that.Overall, Thor is a good coming of age story. Before this movie came out I would have never thought that Thor could work in live action. However, this film and the Avengers definitely proved me wrong. If you are a fan of the Thor comics or are just a fan of the MCU them definitely check this out.","

"strong-122-478885","11 June 2014","Movie Quote: ""For the first time in my life I have no idea what I'm supposed to do."" (Duh! Thank you, Thor!) When Asgard's #1 hillbilly-hero (the big, blond, bad-boy, Thor) flashed Jane a dumb ""aw-shucks"" smile and said - ""Where I come from magic & science are one and the same."" - That, all you fans of intelligent Sci-Fi, summed up this rinky-dinky, little, thumb-twiddler in a literal cosmic-nutshell.With Thor obviously having more brawn than brains, I honestly couldn't tell which was thicker - His skull or his beloved hammer (which, by the way, clearly looked to be made out of plastic).Basically a very stale ""good bro/bad bro"" story, ""Thor's"" villain (brother Loki) was such a sniveling wimp that he couldn't even bask in the glory of his own wickedness and that, in my books, rendered him completely useless in the scheme of things.With its technology overload and its equally absurd costumes straight out of a Sci-Fi convention, ""Thor"" was very much on par with that of a really bad LSD trip where even Asians and Blacks inexplicably played their heroic part in toppling Nordic Mythology to its very foundation.The sucking back and forth between different realms was, genuinely, a messy and confused affair. This ridiculous business quickly became so annoyingly monotonous that I decided that, on top of all of its other flaws, ""Thor"" only deserved a 4-star rating.From start to finish, this film was an utter disgrace to all things regarded as noble and heroic. And the trite, little romance that transpired between that big, blundering oaf, Thor, and the mousy, non-charismatic Jane, sucked to the 10th power.","

"Asbjorns1","9 May 2011","The graphics and visuals of the movie were impressive. However as a movie it was no better than a B-movie. Storyline is dull, and something we have seen a million times before.An untried youth (Thor) who wants to prove his worth, but manages only to invoke the wrath of his elders (odin), he is then cast into banishment where he must prove his worth and make wise decisions in order to prove himself and return to his home.While this concept may still work, I think the characters are extremely superficial and boring. And furthermore, as a Scandinavian I'm pretty disgusted by the rendition of Asgard and its inhibitors. They have only scratched the surface of the characters (how they originally were described) should behave, and they are in no way as barbaric as they should be.Also, what the hell is up with the casting? Some of the gods are Asians and black, and Sif is dark-haired and not the wife of Thor? Taken from Wikipedia ""Sif is the wife of the god Thor and is known for her golden hair."" That is literally what she is known for. I am no racist person but they should all be tall, blond and brutal.Terrible movie :(","

"caseynicholson","4 February 2015","It really does get better every time. I can say that because I didn't much care for this movie when I saw it in the theater, but after having seen it for maybe the fourth time over the weekend, I'm now prepared to give this film 9/10 stars. Here's why:The problem with Thor, as a movie, as a comic book, and as a character in general--is that it's Thor. He's at one and the same time a great character that does have a legendary mythical story to his name, and yet the issue is that his story is so removed from the genus of superheroes that are most common and that so many of us are most comfortable with. There's nothing wrong with that, per say, but Batman, Daredevil, Spider-man, Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, etc, etc, all have the advantage that their stories take place in the world we know. Even Superman is set on earth, albeit with an out-of-this-world origin, but the extra-terrestrial origin of Superman or other alien sci-fi heroes is yet a different sort of tale than Thor's.Thor is, literally, a mythical god. He comes from Asgard, and his father is Odin--just like in the Norse myths. That's the first thing that makes him stand out as a character. But then he gets thrust into adventures on earth, and his destiny becomes wrapped up with the earth. Add in the fact that Marvel then constructs a unique origin story so that Thor and his ilk are actually just a race of aliens, but who happen to have magical powers and weaponry that equate to those of the Norse gods, and the final product, in my view, is a jumbled up mess of a storyline. In other words, I have a pre-existing prejudice against Thor. I think he's great as a character in his own right, but when it comes to actually reading his comics, I'm not a big fan. And that distaste carried over into the movie for me the first time I saw it. It was hard for me to get into the Frost Giants storyline, and I felt like the whole Asgard thing was perhaps as well done as it could possibly be, but nevertheless couldn't escape the hokiness of the Thor franchise.But, as I said above, the movie does grow on you the more you watch it, and in my particular case the repetition has warmed my heart to the Thunder God, and more precisely to this film. The truth is that once I got past my prejudices, the film itself is an outstanding addition to Marvel's MCU canon, and I can't really say too much negative about the film. The final showdown with Loki still sort of wreaks of the 1980's ""He-Man"" film a bit for me, but aside from that the movie is a well made, top notch production.Of course, nothing could be as good as that 1960's animated ""Thor"" pilot. Google it. You'll thank me.","

"ThreeGuysOneMovie","22 September 2011","My expectations were set pretty low with this film. I am a bit of a comic nerd but was never really that into the Thor books. Most of my interactions with the character were from his role in the Avengers. As a kid I just never really related to his bombastic personality and was fairly ignorant of his Norse God back story.This film more than enlightened me to the wonders of the Norse God of Thunder. Chris Hemsworth portrays an unbelievably ripped Thor the god of thunder in this picture. The plot centers on Thor being cast out of Asgard by his father King Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Thor is ousted for disobeying his father's commands and almost starting a war with the frost giants. He is banished to earth and stripped of his godly powers and his mighty hammer mjolnir. When he reaches earth he runs into, literally, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The rest of the film centers on Thor trying to get his powers back and help his Father Odin who is gravely injured.The story itself focused extensively on the Thor Norse god origin story. More than half the picture does not take place with Thor on earth. Thankfully his bombastic personality was juxtaposed with humor and a budding romance with Jane. The cast in this film was top notch and I especially enjoyed Hopkins as mighty god king Odin and Portman as the sexy scientist Jane. The movie has some awesome looking special effects and CGI created monsters. The kingdom of Asgard that is depicted is truly something to behold. The action is fast and plentiful throughout the film, with just enough time to catch your breath and get your bearings. Your speakers will also be getting a workout from the sounds of mighty combat. Although the action might be a little over the top for some I found it fun escapism.Unfortunately, I can't really address if the film sticks to the Marvel comics canon. As stated previously I am just not that familiar with the Thor series. I did however catch a sweet Cameo by Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Stan Lee makes his usual drop in. In summation this is well worth a rental for and a viewing in your lair. While not the greatest superhero movie of all time it was certainly entertaining. Without a doubt it whets my appetite even more to hear Avengers assemble!","

"carlkevad","29 April 2011","Kenneth Branagh, the man who brought us Shakespearean masterpieces such as 'Hamlet' and 'Henry V', directs 'Thor', a marvelous summer-starter (even though there's still one month till summer begins).'Thor' stars Chris Hemsworth, a relatively unknown actor, as, you guessed it, Thor. Now from the trailers, it seemed to me that this was going to be yet another wannabe superhero flick with kick ass special effects and fight scenes, lacking any depth, and starring a talentless six-pack. Well I was wrong. 'Thor' is probably Marvel's best film, and I'd even go as far as saying that it is the third best superhero film of all time (right behind Christopher Nolan's masterpieces).The plot is as follows... Thor, the bloodthirsty warrior and heir, is banished from the eternal kingdom of Asgard by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), after disobeying his command, to a distant realm... called Earth! Now he needs to get back, but his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who was previously living in Thor's shadow, is proclaimed temporary king after his father collapses on a staircase, or something, and he doesn't want to let his cool brother back home, so Thor has to stay on Earth, with all the puny beings. He then falls in love with Jane (Natalie Portman), who is somewhat of a scientist, and changes his mind from ""kill everybody who threatens my well-being"" to ""now wait a second, let's reason a bit here"".The movie's directed by Kenneth Branagh, the director of masterpieces such as 'Henry V', in which his also starred in, and received two Oscar nominations for both directing and acting. He may also be known to some as the goof-ball professor Gilderoy Lockhart from 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'. Here, he takes a break from acting, or producing, or writing, and just directs this masterpiece. Hollywood is really heading in the right direction with hiring artsy directors to direct explosion-explosion films. Another great example would be the upcoming 'Captain America: The First Avenger', directed by Joe Johnston, who brought us the very good coming-of-age story, 'October Sky'. I hope 'Captain America' is gonna be as good as 'Thor'. A part inside me somehow doesn't want it to be better, I don't why though.Alongside Hemsworth, star Jane's friends Erik Selvig (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd), and Darcy... something (Kat Dennings); Thor's friends Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Sif (Jaimie Alexander), and Fandral (Josh Dallas/Cary Elwes-lookalike); and the nosy SHIELD agent, Coulson (Clark Gregg). The ensemble cast all give great performances, which aren't meant for you to remember, aside from Ray Stevenson, who is always awesome.The movie references a few other superhero films/comics, which is quite appropriate given the fact that 'The Avengers' movie is getting closer and closer. We can also see Jeremy Renner in a cameo probably as Hawkeye, he's also gonna play Hawkeye in 'The Avengers'. And, I didn't stay in the theater until the credits were over, but IMDb tells me that Samuel L. Jackson has a cameo after the credits as Nick Fury. - How exciting! I'm thinking of seeing it again just for that.'Thor' is the second superhero film out this year so far. The previous one was 'The Green Hornet', which was just a horrible attempt at mixing comedy with action. 'The Green Hornet' was however the first 3-D superhero flick. 'Thor' is in 3-D too, but I'd rather go with 2-D on this one, since there are too many shiny lights in the Asgard scenes, which would make my brain explode with 3-D glasses on.There are five superhero films in 2011, three of them are still unreleased. They are: the crappy '...Green Hornet'; the amazing 'Thor'; the comes-out-on-my-birthday 'X-Men: First Class'; the gonna-be-awesome 'Green Lantern; and my most anticipated film of the year, 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. I sincerely hope that they are all on the level of 'Thor'. I don't like repeating myself here, but something inside me forbids me from wanting the other films be better than 'Thor'. Maybe I'm crazy, I don't know.'Thor's special effects are spectacular, and deserving a Best Visual Effects Oscar nomination. From the epic battle scenes between the almighty gods, to the amazing scenes in Asgard, 'Thor's special effects are probably the greatest ones I've seen since 'Avatar', yeah! Plus, 'Avatar' kinda sucked from the story perspective, and 'Thor' is good on every level, so 'Thor' > 'Avatar', that's probably gonna set a certain individual off, I hope.Anyway... Under Branagh's gentle direction, 'Thor' is by far one of the best films of 2011, and right behind Nolan's Batmans as one of the greatest superhero films of all time, featuring a star-making turn by Chris Hemsworth - a Hollywood newcomer with a six-pack, and brains!Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…Comment on review here and sign up on my site: http://carlkevad.webs.com/apps/blog/show/6882606-the-god-of-thunder-","

"deadman71","31 May 2011","I will start by saying I was never a big fan of Thor in the Marvel universe. There was just something about the character that annoyed me.I wasn't expecting much from the film as I have never been sold on Kenneth Branagh as a director or in fact as an actor (way to lovey dovey for my taste). However I went to see it as I am really looking forward to The Avengers movie and wanted to go in after seeing the films leading up to it.I am glad to say not only did I enjoy Thor, I enjoyed it a lot. The film is great. It is well acted, well directed and goes along at a brisk pace. The first part of the film filling in the back story was done with a lot of pace but didn't feel rushed. The action was superb and I now have a growing respect for Kenneth Branagh.It is not perfect but it is purely enjoyable. In fact I would say it is to date the best of the films leading to The Avengers.","

"mike198326","2 May 2011","in one word Awesome!I was really curious and excited to see Thor as I love big budget movies and also it's the first time I see Kenneth Branagh directing a movie like this. Normally it's not his style. So I went in and just loved it!. It's so beautiful to look at, at how beautiful they've made Asgaard look. It's not so much a comic book movie but the Thor myth come to life! It's funny, witty, moving ( a few scenes I admit I was crying like when Thor was so happy to have found his hammer but could not lift it and the scene at the end between him and Odin, played by an astounding Anthony Hopkins who IS Odin, and does even a better job than Bob Hoskins. And yes it did remind me of The Mask with Loki etc. This is in my opinion the BEST movie that SIR Kenneth Branagh has ever made and I hope they call on him if ever there's a Thor 2!","

"Caleb_Everett","23 May 2019","The Great and Mighty Thor falls from Odin's grace in this mythical adventure in the MCU.It's the first time we are introduced to otherworldly concepts and types of transportation such as the Bifrost in the MCU. Chris Hemsworth, in my opinion, is the perfect Thor. He plays the role so well and also looks the part beautifully. For me, this is the second weakest of the entry-level MCU movies.It's a great story and really explains Thor's character development, which is truly important for his future in the MCU, but it just isn't extremely strong in terms of story. I think the other biggest downfall is the town that they are in, I read that the town was created for the movie and it honestly looks like it. I know that's a petty thing, but it just really sticks out to me. I also feel like Thor's progression from this crass & arrogant person to a noble and gallant person was super fast! I mean literally in the matter of a few days he realizes his years of folly? I suppose the argument could be made that as a ""God"" he can see it and adjust quicker.Either way, I still love the film and would watch it again.","

"tavm","9 May 2011","Just watched Thor in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and while I admit I fell asleep during some of the beginning parts, by the time the title character's brother Loki reveals his intentions, I was riveted the rest of the picture. Kenneth Branagh is fine directing the dialogue and action sequences and the one picked to play Thor is quite charismatic especially when talking to the mortal Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. I wish I had managed to stay awake for the whole thing but still, this was a highly enjoyable movie to watch in a cinema. Oh, and Loki as the villain is very compelling when he's revealed as such and one more thing, look for creator Stan Lee in a cameo since this is a Marvel-based movie of a character he created...","

"k_wallander","30 April 2011","My title really sums up how I perceived this great movie. I just returned home from watching this tonight. And holy cow, Mr. Brannagh really delivered!! When Kenneth Brannagh was announced as Thor's director, I was really expecting something great from the one who directed various Shakespeare adaptations. I've only saw his remake of ""Sleuth"", and despite weak ratings from the critics I really liked that crime flick. I really loved how he handled the characters. Brannagh really knows how to set the stage for clever and suspenseful drama. Furthermore I adore him as an actor (my IMDb nickname says you that).So as a longtime comic-book fan I was really excited getting to see a visually spectacular and dramatic comic-book adaptation by a skillful director. And boy my expectations were fulfilled. F...... hell, this rocked!! The (first two) X-men and Iron Man movies were always said to be the Marvel Masterpieces when it comes to movie adaptations. Personally I always thought these movies to be entertaining, but not much more. They didn't really deliver an epic feeling. They didn't introduce you to a fantastic world in all it's glorious beauty that wants you to explore it. ""Thor"" just delivers all that. To me ""Thor"" stands as the best Marvel comic-book-movie till now, by far...First of all, the characters are really likable and portrayed in a realistic way. All character developments don't seem to be forced. The most interesting character is Loki. At the beginning I really felt sympathy for him. It is until a tragic revelation, where his character undergoes a change to a more evil side, but even then some of his behaviors seem to be understandable. The father-son conflict is portrayed brilliantly. Kenneth Brannagh at his best!!This movie is visually outstanding and some scenes, like for example the prologue, deliver this ""LotR"" feeling that gives you the goosebumps. There are many memorable shots that are purely majestic. When Thor, Sif and the Warriors Three ride on the BifrÃ¶st it just shouts ""pure awesomeness"" into your face. Many scenes on Asgard are just spot on. The buildings on Asgard seem to be based on a hybrid of krypton and middle-earthen architecture. The visuals on this world show the advanced, noble and god-like status of the Asgardians. Asgard is depicted as a heavenly and unbelievably beautiful realm in the never-ending depths of the cold space. It provides a subject for speculations, if the Asgardians are indeed gods with magical powers, or if they are extraterrestrial beings with technology far beyond our understandings, but the movie doesn't really discusses this issue and leaves it to the audience to give an opinion in this matter. What else can be said? The action was exciting. While the frost-giant-battle on Jotunheim was a bit visual overkill and at some parts almost cartoony, the fights on earth were harsh, gritty and bloody. Brannagh really handled the different worlds very well. On earth, humor was predominant, the scenes on Asgard stood out for Shakespearian drama, while Jotunheim delivered a creepy and threatening atmosphere. The CGI-Environments were all breathtaking. There were sequences (BifrÃ¶st, Asgard mainly) that really were out of this world. All in all, the visual effects were amazing and god-worthy. The score was magnificent, it perfectly captured the proudness and courage of the Asgardians.I gave ""Thor"" a 10 out of 10. It surely is on of the best movies of it's kind. I stands up there with ""The Dark Knight"", ""Star Trek"", ""Avatar"" and ""Inception"". It's the perfect Blockbuster.","

"dermot23","26 April 2011","after weeks of seeing trailers for this on TV, I finally got to see this last night at my local cinema. I love superhero movies, and this movie didn't let me down at all. I was Thor-oughly entertained from start to finish. this was different to other movies in the genre, it had a bit of everything,sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, drama. The acting was great, Chis hemsworth as Thor was perfect. he has a certain prescence on screen and oozes charisma.looked the part too, beefing up well for the role.For an Australian, he really nailed the medieval English accent required. he definitely has a future in film, i can see him playing a jason bourne type character in the future. Other top actors in the film played their parts well too. most notable Anthony Hopkins as Thors father Odin and Tom Hiddleston as Thors brother Loki. Natalie Portman was fine as scientist love interest Jane Foster, but all she had to do really was say her lines and look good, which she did great. the 3d effects in this movie also added to the entertainment. I thaught the effects were as good as avatar in places. certainly better than any other 3d film other than avatar. didn't take away from the action at all like in films such as Clash of the Titans, where the effects became blurry at times. the scenes in thors home realm Asdgard were especially good in 3d. I would definitely recommend seeing this in 3d if you have a choice.To sum up, fantastic summer superhero blockbuster that doesn't fail to entertain, had the potential to be really bad but wasn't at all. has all the elements that make a great summer blockbuster, superhero movie, go see it !!","

After 30 minutes of watching I still have almost no feel for the characters but rather have sat through tons of boring over the top CGI action scenes that are devoid of any tension because I don't give a damn about the characters. This is one of the most clichÃ© ""someone from a different time/world/realm comes to modern day earth"" movies I have seen and to make matters worse they (the film-makers) insist that it's funny! What a great use of 150 million dollars! Fu@k the poor starving nations, we gotta have more and more expensive movies!

"invisibleunicornninja","13 February 2018","When I sat down to watch this movie, I was prepared to enjoy it. I like superhero movies, and I heard a lot of good reviews. I don't agree with any of the critics I listened to before watching. The beginning is actually ok. The visual effects are good and the action is partially decent (at least at the beginning). The only reason I enjoyed this movie was because I was laughing so hard. Not at any ""jokes"" though. I was laughing more at this movie's incompetence. If you are one of the surprisingly numerous people who enjoyed this nonsense, I'd appreciate it if you actually read my points on why this movie is terrible. -The romance takes place over the course of about a day, and during most of that time Thor and Natalie Portman are nowhere near each other. Like, she runs him over with his car, they have a few brief conversations, then all of a sudden Thor is crying over the possibility of never seeing her again. It feels stupid and rushed.-Thor doesn't really do anything to deserve the hammer. Like the stupid love story, this character arc (I was told it was supposed to be one) feels incredibly rushed. What they could've done instead of what they did is have Thor live on Earth for at least a month. They could've shown Thor learning how to live among humans, slowly realize the errors of his ways, and come to regret what he did. Loki's attack could've something that took a while to do and by the time he got around to it Thor could've been ready to defend humans because he actually cared for the species. There could still be the big dumb boring action scene at the end, but at least him getting back the hammer would be deserved. I'm not saying that this would be perfect, but it would be a hell of a lot better then what they went with. -There's a lot of continuity errors. The shots themselves are good, but when they come one after another - not so much. It kinda takes you out of the movie when it goes from broad daylight to night to sunset and back to day over the span of a few sentences. -Nothing makes any sense because nothing is ever explained. Powers/abilities aren't explained. None of the technology is explained (and by technology I mean the alien stuff not human technology - though there is some stuff with Natalie's cellphone that makes little sense but that has more to do with how stupid the characters are). Fight scenes have little tension and aren't fun not only because the characters are unrelatable and the fights themselves are poorly choreographed, but because you don't know what the characters can DO. -The pacing is weird and a very simple plot is made difficult to follow through a very bizarre narrative. -All the government officials are stupid. I get that the doctors were stupid as a joke (I think it was supposed to be a joke) but SHEILD is supposed to be a group of elite government officials. Why is everyone working for them dumber than a sack of bricks?-There are so many plot holes concerning Loki that it makes my head hurt. Just try to think about his plan, and when various pieces of information are revealed to him. IT MAKES NO SENSE.-Thor's friends are all stupid (literally) and underdeveloped. All the characters are underdeveloped, but Thor's friends are practically caricatures. They're annoying and they shouldn't affect the plot as much as they do. Also, ALL the characters are stupid. Everything in this movie is incredibly dumbed down to the point where nothing makes any sense. I don't know a lot about how this movie was made, but everything feels very rushed. This movie could've been decent with an extra half hour of run time, better actors, and an editor who understands editing. The only people who seemed to know what they were doing were the camera people and whoever was in costumes/makeup/effects.","

"EmDee-427-469344","3 November 2013","Truly awful that they paid 150 mill and got a movie that is worse than the first Terminator movie in believability and entertainment. Really, the actors must have been paid millions to be in this and just rode the money train (as usual)- e.g. Natalie Portman who can't act beyond 'pretty eyelash fluttering girl in love"" and ""angry girl in love"".Not to mention the girl from ""Two broke girls"" (sorry I don't care enough to research her name) who acts exactly the same way in this and anything else I've accidentally caught her in while channel surfing i.e. dry humor delivered like she's a teen-aged emo (or copying Daria from ""Daria"" who was obviously her acting inspiration). Anthony Hopkins is an amazing man to watch because he can act and he commands the screen- even he couldn't save this 150 million dollar scam film.The Hemsworth guy is just your typical ""get your shirt off for no reason other than to show off the abs and fake tan"" male lead (done to death since Sylvester Stallone in the 1980's). Plus he has blue eyes and blonde hair- i.e. the epitome of conventional attractiveness. Yeah yeah no ""He was meant to be Norse so he was blonde"" apologist ranting thanks, considering everyone else who was supposed to be Norse was not blonde with blue eyes. Hollywood will continue getting away with it while saps line up to pay --- I didn't :D","

"Wuchakk","28 September 2011","Released in 2011, ""Thor"" is based on the long-running Marvel comic book. The comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms -- the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories.The film is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).THE PLOT (minor plot SPOILER): Odin the ""Allfather"" is about to anoint Thor as the next king of Asgard, but his son displays folly, arrogance, disrespect and rebellion, forcing Odin to discipline him. Thor is stripped of his godhood and his incredible hammer, Mjolnir, and banished to the earth with no more power than any mortal his size. Thor encounters Jane Porter & her colleagues, as well as the US Government, in his quest for Mjolnir and redemption. Meanwhile his jealous brother Loki enacts schemes in Asgard, forcing the Warrior's Three and Sif to leave and find the exiled Thor. Loki sends The Destroyer to eliminate his brother, which also threatens the thunder god's new group of mortal friends.You couldn't ask for a better cast: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki and three total babes as Jane Porter, Jane's friend Darcy and Lady Sif -- Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings and Jaimie Alexander respectively. Some complain about the Asian and African actors in the roles of Hogun and Heimdall, but Hogun always seemed to be modeled after Mongol-types. And who says there aren't other races on Asgard anyway? The Norse encountered some Asgardians many centuries ago spurring their mythology, which naturally didn't include (then) far-off races, but who says the real Asgardians weren't racially diverse? Some criticize the film as campy because it deals with Norse mythology and the fact that the whole realm of Asgard can seem outlandish and cartooney. Yet the movie isn't about their mythology but about the actual Asgardians, who are very real in this story.""Thor"" works so well because it's more than just a bunch mindless superhero mumbo jumbo and exciting action/CGI. The deep themes include the pitfalls of arrogance, juvenile rebellion, jealousy, rivalry and deceit, as well as the universal nobility of humility, repentance, courage and sacrificial love. Then there's the ""fish out of water"" element of Thor exiled to earth and the curious things he does. On top of all this, we get a complex and interesting villain for a change. Sure the movie has a comic booky vibe, but that's what ""Thor"" is based on. To dismiss it as a campy superhero flick is grossly inaccurate.The film runs 115 minutes and the Earth episodes were shot in New Mexico.The DVD features 4 deleted scenes, a ""Road to the Avengers"" featurette, a director's commentary and a few trailers.FINAL WORD: I don't think you could ask for a better film adaption of the Thor comic and the thunder god's adventures in Asgard, Earth and elsewhere. The addition of the Destroyer is a plusGRADE: A-","

There's no overpowering 3D effects here which is great, but because the glasses darken the image the first 10 or so minutes were a bit hard to see.The story line was good, I don't know how much it parallels any of the source material but there are times when you think you know what's happening and when, but are pleasantly surprised.As this is my first comment and I'm not sure what exactly constitutes a spoiler I will say one thing and that is to make sure, like many marvel films to pay respect to the film makers and stay till after the credits.

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","Thor is a fun, fast-paced, well-acted and well-written movie to come out of the MCU's early days. It has great CGI, an excellent score, and the environments are great to look at (Mild spoilers follow).Thor has three main locations: Asgard, Thor's home and the kingdom ruled by his father Odin, Jotunheim, the land of the Frost Giants, and Earth, which we all know and love. The costumes on display are impressively designed, some of my favorites being Thor's, Loki's, Odin's and Laufey's.The cast consists of Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Natalie Portman (Jane Foster), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Jaimie Alexander (Lady Sif), Kat Dennings (Darcy Lewis), Stellan Skarsgard (Erik Selvig), Clark Gregg (Phil Coulson), Idris Elba (Heimdall), Rene Russo (Frigga), and Anthony Hopkins as Odin.I personally really enjoy Thor and feel it is underrated by a lot of people.In this movie, Thor, the God of Thunder, is banished from his home of Asgard by his father Odin after nearly starting a war with the Frost Giants, and as a result he's stripped of his powers and sent to Earth. Here, he meets Jane, Darcy and Selvig, and he works to find his hammer, which is the instrument of his power, and return to Asgard. Meanwhile, Thor's brother Loki schemes to take over the throne of Asgard, and Thor needs to try and stop him.The plot is fairly straightforward, and I imagine that most viewers will appreciate the simplicity of the story, especially in regards to the characters. Chris Hemsworth shines as Thor, balancing steady charisma with a hint of arrogance that would irritate Tony Stark. Natalie Portman's Jane makes for a fun counterpoint to Thor, and Selvig also gets his chances to shine. Of course, no review of this movie would be complete without mentioning Tom Hiddleston's Loki. He's a trickster, and you never really know what he's up to until it's too late. He always keeps you guessing, and he's desperate for his father's approval, making him a tragic figure who's interesting to watch.This movie sets a lot of stones for future MCU films, such as Thor's journey to becoming a worthy king of Asgard, Loki becoming the first villain for the Avengers, and opening up this movie universe to the more cosmic side of Marvel comics. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun movie to watch.","

This movie had such a magical feel to it with the Asgard powers and world. Almost felt a little LOTRingsish because of the swords mythology and unknown colorful sciences of the Asgard.

"muttsnutman","20 May 2011","This is a fun movie with a lot of nice humorous touches. It is as much fun as Iron Man with perhaps just a little more depth to the back story.OK the whole thing is a crock from a scientific or mythological point of view... but who cares? If you are the sort of person who complains because James Bond can't really have an invisible car then maybe you should get a life.If you want to spend a couple of hours being entertained by an action movie that is also complex enough to argue about in the bar later, then this absolutely hits the spot. Portman and Skarsgaard are almost only cameos and Hemsworth practically carries the film, but the cast all deliver well. This is entertainment that sits fairly and squarely in the 'let's pretend a little bit' camp and rewards the viewer with some good action scenes, a plot that has some substance, and a few good gags along the way. Go see it if you want a couple of hours fun. NickB","

"RichardSRussell-1","10 May 2011","Thor (1:55, PG-13, 3-D) â€” fantasy: comics & pulps, biggie, crossover""When someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!""This advice may well have applied to Bill Murray or Dan Aykroyd, but Sigourney Weaver's Zuul would never have even thot to ask it of Chris Hemsworth, who is so obviously a deity that the question would never have arisen.There's probably a casting hall of fame somewhere in self-congratulatory Hollywood. In it you will undoubtedly find Madonna as Evita, Patrick Stewart as Prof. Xavier, Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, and, on a plinth in the grand lobby, Christopher Reeve as Superman. Save a spot for young Mr. Hemsworth, because he is every ell the incarnation of the Norse thunder god Thor.If there's a like mecca for production design, seek not there for the shabby, Holiday Inn Olympus of Percy Jackson or Clash of the Titans. But Thor's Asgard truly deserves recognition. It is a proper home for the gods, grand, sweeping, and awe-inspiring. Not at all claustrophobic, it uses SPACE. This is what 3-D was made for. Regrettably, the sole Imax theater in my city was already committed to Born To Be Wild, so I didn't get its added benefit, but I would have leapt at the opportunity.If you've been following along in the series of films set in the Marvel comic-book universe, you know that Col. Nick Fury of SHIELD (Samuel L. Jackson) has been assembling a team of super-heroes to meet the recurring existential threats to humanity. SHIELD's top field agent, Clark Gregg's Coulson (or ""son of Coul"", as Thor calls him) keeps turning up on the periphery of Iron Man, Hulk, etc. Here he has a larger role as the AIC investigating the overnight appearance in the New Mexico desert of an impressively heavy artifact fallen from the skies. This is Mjolnir, the thunder hammer, forged from the heart of a star and wieldable only by one worthy of its might and power.First on the scene of its appearance is a trio of anomaly trackers, led by researcher Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and including mentor Erik Selvig (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) and brilliant grad assistant Darcy Lewis (the scene-stealing Kat Dennings). The SHIELD guys, arriving shortly thereafter, confiscate all of their research notes, but not before they've already encountered the quirky, tall, handsome, muscular blond guy who says he OWNS the artifact. They decide to join forces with him so everybody can get their goodies back.OK, it must be admitted up front that Natalie Portman, Oscar fresh in hand, is not going to displace anybody's idea of a top female astrophysicist. That will always be Jodie Foster's Ellie Arroway from Contact. But Portman isn't called on to do much astrophysicking here, and she's properly heroic, winsome, capable, flustered, and imaginative as required. She's an ideal foil for Hemsworth's Thor, who is undergoing a crisis of integrity, thrown out of Asgard by all-father (and HIS father) Odin after leading an ill-conceived, if daring, raid of retribution against the frost giants of Jodenheim. ""A wise king never seeks out war,"" intones Odin (a regal Anthony Hopkins), ""but he must be ready for it!""The action alternates between the realms of the gods and the mortals, with occasional side excursions to Jodenheim. The interstate highway of the heavens begins on the rainbow bridge, Bifrost, at the far end of which is the giant rotary spherical zapper that can propel the gods halfway across known space; it's guarded by the taciturn but totally impressive swordsman Heimdall (Idris Elba).Thor's fellow godlings are a worthy bunch, and Rene Russo's few appearances as Odin's consort Frigga leave a much bigger impression than their brevity would normally warrant. Tom Hiddleston as Thor's ""brother"" Loki is highly effective, and his role is particularly well written, abounding in ambiguity and plausible motivation.While I've concentrated on the grandiose (as does the movie), there's plenty of nitty-gritty realism, including mud, blood, pain, and grief; PG-13-level romance; and no small amount of humor. The film does a good job of portraying Thor's time on Earth as a large-living odd duck out of his normal pond without making him seem overbearing; if this part had gone on too long, it would have irritated, but it doesn't, primarily because our hero (for who could doubt that he is?) is a quick study and innately a noble protector of the underdog.And so another piece in the larger puzzle slips into place. Next up: That super-soldier from WW2. Is HE still around? We may have to wait nearly until August to find out.","

"GTeixeira","11 August 2013","'Thor' follows its eponymous protagonist, the Norse god of thunder, banished to Earth to learn humility, as his brash and arrogant attitudes provoke a war. Meanwhile, his brother Loki takes his chance to seize the Asgardian throne.Part of Marvel's attempt to create a cinematic superhero universe (the Avengers franchise), 'Thor' stands apart as the most outworldly of the bunch despite its basic banishment and redemption plot. I did not know much of the superhero beforehand, but I know a lot of Norse mythology and I felt Marvel's attempt to recreate it within a real world to be very good. The visuals of Asgard (and Jotunheim) are stunning and truly worthy of gods, whereas the effects involved in the Bifrost scenes are also wonderful.Kenneth Branagh, mostly known for his Shakespeare adaptations ('Henry V', 'Hamlet'), is quite an odd directorial choice. He brings a distinct Shakespearean feeling to this film: the Asgardian world has a distinct medieval structure, with Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in special evoking quite a lot the kings of old. Many other developments within the film reminds of 'King Lear', 'Henry V' and other Shakespeare's works, plus a very old-fashioned dialogue.The cast is partially good. Anthony Hopkins, as Odin, is capable of transmitting the regal wisdom and imperative power of his character. Chris Hemsworth is well cast as Thor as far as looks are concerned, and manages to convey well the god's personality. Tom Hiddleston shines as Loki, a delightfully machiavellian villain, and gives quite a powerful performance as the film's most complex character (surprisingly so for a superhero film). The other Asgardian characters, in special Heimdall (a controversial Idris Elba), are also very good. On the other hand, the film faces quite a bit of problem with the Earth setting. Not only is this part of the film very dull when compared to the Asgard one, the redemption part of the story is quite rushed with Thor somehow relearning his values far too fast to be believable. The rather weak performances from the human cast (Natalie Portman in particular is very bad, but Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings don't shine either) only makes the situation worse. There are some tries at humor, which doesn't work always, and some rather good action sequences.The film is mostly successful thanks to the stunning Asgard portion of the story (8/10), but it suffers from the rather poor earthly development (5/10). Overall, still quite a fun superhero film.","

"jpm4444","11 May 2011","I won't give out any spoilers or plots but I was semi bored at times with this movie. Natalie Portman looked and acted like she was a sophomore in college and it just didn't work for me. As with most movies in this genre, the most interesting characters are the ""bad guys"". Tom Hiddleston was great as Loki and Anthony Hopkins can do no wrong in most every part he plays. The acting just seemed shallow and simple and I really don't get why some like this movie so much. I think teens will enjoy this movie a lot more than adults. The movie is only 104 minutes long and it shows there could have been a lot more to the story.","

I mean if you can make a PG-13 cook like this then I'm all ready with my popcorn. Loved the sound effects too. And the the music as they lead you into Asgard at the beginning, Just beautifully done. Portman was good along side Hemsworth, too. Love it when they go into Yodenheim. And when Thor is zipping thru the air and takes down that monster, Thank you, we needed that. The scene with the robot was like.....WoW. Gimme more.","

"Christian_Dimartino","16 July 2011","Thor is one of the best films of the summer, and its mainly because there has never been a comic book movie like it before. Thor has a lot of fantasy and magic, and part of its magic is newcomer Chris Hemsworth who plays his role so well you long for a sequel.Thor is an arrogant God who is cast out of his realm by his father, Odin(Anthony Hopkins). Thor is sent to earth, where he meets Jane(Natalie Portman) a scientist, and her friends(Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgaard) who try to find out who and what he is. Meanwhile back on his planet, Thor's brother Loki(Tom Hiddleston) finds about about his past, and tries to take over the realm.Thor is a lot of fun. There are a lot of laughs, and a lot of thrills. I like the relationship between Thor and Jane. Normally, the love interest is always playing hard to get, but you know right off the bat that Jane likes him, and I like that.Thor isn't like your normal comic book movie. Its fresh, there is no training sessions or girlfriends who are hard to get. Its a fantasy, and there's more of a story here. Director Kenneth Branaugh(?) was a surprising choice, and a very good one to say the least.I think Thor is one of the Summer's best films, and I really hope to see more of Thor and Jane in the future. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. If you're expecting something cheesy and predictable, don't. Trust me, Thor will charm you.A-","

"bling77","3 May 2011","Let me start off by thanking Marvel Studios, cast and crew. They made a wonderful adaptation of Thor. When I first read that they were making Thor, I never expected to see such an amazing comic based adaptation. The movie is mostly based in Asgard which they obviously worked very hard on the design and their hard work payed off. Thor might be bigger than most superhero movies.The movie is very funny, I loved the humor in it. It's not very much dramatic and doesn't include much action which to me wasn't a disappointment because the writer obviously wanted to introduce Thor to watchers. They portrayed the origin in a very good way and the movie started with in an excellent way. The acting was spectacular, Tom Hiddleston just wowed me throughout the movie, Idriss Elba was perfect as Heimdall and the rest of the cast was excellent. Wardrobe was amazing, they didn't change much and didn't ruin anything for comic book fans.I never expected to see such a movie that can actually take you to another ""realm"" and makes you believe its real. I suggest you see Thor, thank god Egypt had a early release date.Thor is truly Mighty","

"jhudson-11704","27 July 2017","Marvel's leap into the cosmos started off with a good movie, not great, but still a good movie. The look of Asgard and it's citizens was incredible as it looks well designed, mystic and huge. This movie brought us a great hero that must prove himself to be worthy of his name and a villain that proves to be one of the best in superhero movie history.Chris Hemsworth's Thor is strong, brave, naive and yet still able to change into a better person. I must give credit to Hemsworth for getting into such shape that he totally looks like a Norse warrior god but he wasn't the star of this film. That honor goes to Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Hiddleston shows so much emotion in his acting and I actually was rooting for him for most in this movie because all he wanted was for his ""father"", Odin, to look at him as an equal to Thor. Once he discovers the true lineage of himself, Loki becomes even greater as someone who just wants to know where he fits into the world. In the end, he is such a great villain that it is clear that he is going to be around forever because of his instant appeal and success.The appearance of Asgard and it's citizens were incredible and medieval in some way, however, it is a shame that a lot of the movie takes place on Earth, thankfully though, not in a big city. That might of just been for budget constraints but it was possibly just help fortify Thor's journey to humility. The side characters were split for me though. The Asgardians, specifically Volstagg, Odin and Sif, interested me enough, however, the others didn't leave a lasting impression. The Earth characters though were definitely worse. While I did like Coulson and Selvig, Jane and Darcy weren't interesting at all. Jane was just a typical romantic lead where I couldn't see much chemistry between Thor and Jane. Jane's giggling over Thor was pretty infuriating. That and I don't really buy Natalie Portman as a physicist. She's a good actress, but she couldn't persuade me that she was a scientist. And Darcy was nothing but the annoying ""comic relief"".Also, hi Hawkeye, nice to see you there for the 2ish minutes you were on screen.+ Hiddleston and Hemsworth + Asgardian aesthetic + Some of the characters (Coulson, Selvig, Sif, Odin, Volstagg) - Others really didn't match up so well - Would have preferred more time off Earth as it is Marvel's first step into the cosmosFinal Score: 8.1/10","

"therockdemon","25 April 2011","i went in to this film very excited not just about what it setting up (the avengers) but because it is the start of the summer action season that has two other big comic book based movies (captain America and green lantern) and i am very happy to say that it did not disappoint, it felt very close to iron man in tone and pacing but lacked iron mans humour but that is a good thing because if it was trying to make you laugh at every line then you wouldn't believe the beautiful scenery in Asgard could mix in with the plain desert town that the rest of the film is set in, a special mention has to go to Kenneth Branagh and the writers for making the female characters so realistic and strong people not just the normal stereotypical female roles. PS stay after the credits it is worth it just me.","

"cosmorados","2 May 2011","In the beginning ...ish, Odin and his people overthrew the frost giants and their attempted occupation of Earth and came to a sort of peace between the different galactic realms. As a king he overseas this peace, as a father, he attempts to instill a sense of wisdom in his two sons, Loki and Thor. However, when their realm is broken into by the Frost giants Thor's attempt at retribution is ill-thought out and Odin is forced to act, stripping Thor of his status as heir and banishing him to Earth, after which, medium-sized hell breaks loose. Can Thor regain his place as Heir of Asgard and be worthy again to wield his mighty hammer, which I have thus far forgot to mention? Many of the film critics that have thus far reviewed Thor seem to regard him as an also-ran in the Marvel catalogue of heroes, not knowing perhaps that Thor was one of the company's biggest heroes, however, bringing a Norse God into a sense of modern reality was always going to be tricky, and it would have been easy to have a giant-sized ""Masters of the Universe"" style mess. However, like Iron Man (The first one, not the disastrous 2nd instalment) it makes its heroes big, larger than life figures, while making their predicaments very human ones, a search for knowledge, a desire for a parent's approval, the folly of youth and the vulnerability of age, ground the story and allow us, as viewers a way into this tale.Kenneth Branagh, while not an obvious first choice for a big budget blockbuster does a decent job of tying all the different elements together, the script is decent and the cast do a good job, with particular praise to both Chris Hemsworth as the brash Thor but also Tom Hiddleston who was very good as the complex and unreadable Loki, who added real depth to what could have been just a, well, a cartoon super-villain really. Enjoyable for young kids who will like the 3D stuff and all the action and okay for their parents who were raised on this stuff. The only major drawback, if you can call it that, is that unlike previous next movie tie-ins after the end credits of recent Marvel films, the one at the end of this one was a bit disappointing. But still. Enjoyable, but not as great as previous Marvel outings.","

"Likes_Ninjas90","18 April 2011","In a magical realm, a war has raged between the Norse gods and a powerful enemy called the Frost Giants. These adversaries have tried to infiltrate the majestic city of Asgard, which belongs to King Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Since they were young the king taught his sons that they must never start a war but only retaliate if truly necessary. His sons are Thor (Chris Hemsworth), an arrogant hammer-wielding warrior and the jealous Loki (Tom Hiddleston). To respond to a sneak attack on the kingdom by the Frost Giants, Thor takes it upon himself to lead a group of his friends to punish the beasts. After barely surviving a deadly battle and having one of his men wounded, Thor is interrogated by Odin and banished for disobeying his father's order for peace. He is stripped of his powers and both he and his magical hammer are blasted out of the magic realm and into the real world. Crash landing on Earth, Thor is hit by the car of astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). She's been investigating the gateways between the real and magical worlds in the New Mexico desert. When her data is stolen by shady government agents, who have also set up a perimeter around the engraved hammer, she enlists the help of Thor to get both of their items back. Here is a film that simultaneously familiarises and dazzles us through a predictable narrative. We're so swept up by the visual exuberance that Kenneth Branagh shoots the film with that the familiarity of an ageing king and his fractured kingdom rarely troubles us. There are predictable double crosses, some romance and opportunities for redemption. It's hard to go wrong with such safe, timeless and universal material. And given the steady hand with which the epic is presented, the film engages. The kingdom of Asgard is itself a stirring and magnificent creation. It's a golden fortress and a majestic city, sweepingly built upon and viewed from across the sea. The interiors are painted with a bronze palette, only to be crusted over by frosty intruders. It's a handsome film to look at, especially in 3D, where the long shots employ some brief but noticeable touches of depth. But disappointingly as the film progresses the 3D becomes less noticeable, particular in the second half. It probably wouldn't be worth paying the extra dollars just to see the opening quarter in 3D. And the only reason for not hearing some alarm bells during an early battle is because of how booming the sound effects are. There's a slickly handled sequence where Thor and his friends take down waves of enemies, but it also suggests that the film will, like many blockbusters, turn into a big budget video game. But after this lengthy stint in the magical realm something unexpected happens: the film develops a sense of humour. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the film is when Thor finds himself in the real world, while still retaining his traditional Norse mannerisms. The fish out of water jokes work well because the scenes are actually funny and unexpected. The best of these comedic moments is shared between Thor walking into a pet store, announcing he needs a horse and in a diner where he smashes a mug on the ground demanding more drink. Pay attention for a Tony Stark reference by one of the government goons towards the end of the film and also an extra scene after the credits too. I like Hemworth's performance in the comedic scenes the best. He plays them straight and serious, as all good comedy should be. His charisma does fade in and out, flashing a smile occasionally but largely being reduced to gruff manly, measured speak. Still, his testosterone voice recalls Russell Crowe in Gladiator and he's physically adept too. It's a step up from the Saddle Club and with more opportunities to develop his performance in the inevitable sequel he'll improve. Portman has him more than covered for charisma though. I don't know what an astrophysicist is meant to sound like but she has boundless energy, with an adorable presence on screen. She's a lot of fun to watch. Hopkins has very little time and with mechanical dialogue there's less emotion to be found in his character or Thor's sidekicks. Regardless, the skill shown in the bloodless action sequences is apparent and the humour is relieving. Comic book fans and younger viewers will thrive here on a film that knows exactly what it is.","

"maddog-50","5 May 2012","It seems to me that the studio tested who would be the right team for the upcoming future superhero movies with the Thor in it. Result so far: except Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins nobody who's work had to do something with this movie should work at another one.The casting was terrible, the Asgard-fellows ???, Portman as a scientist is so wrong as casting Schwarzenegger as Miss Marple, the rest of her film family-fellows ?, Kat Dennings, is she an actress? (she can't act, that's for sure).The CGI, O MG, colorful - more colorful - Asgard. Asgard looked like a LSD-trip of Henri Matisse, a convoluted mess of styles, with ornamented overloaded pseudo technology. The design was awful, ALL the action scene CGI's looked very unrealistic due to the obviously very untalented transformation of motion captures. The storm scenes where very poorly executed. Thankfully most of the Frost Giant stuff was kept in a dark blue, so one cannot see the bad CGI so clearly, and, it's cheaper to produce too.The plot?! Why Frost Giants? Why the epic war nonsense with the Frost Giants? The Result is a plain simple and stupid palace intrigue, one brother against the other, one (the good one) banned by the father whilst the other (the evil one) obtains by fraud the goodwill.How does Thor get his powers back? Because the hammer decided to fly back to him after he's proofed himself worthy? What did he do, he just got punched in the face by a robot. I do not get it.Conveniently, in Asgard they speak 21 century English, so there is no language barrier for Thor. He knows what jeans, cars and cell phones are but he's no glue that in a breakfast restaurant there are no body servants at your command. Well you can script a ""funny"" scene around that BS, but every 8 year old could do that, and better! Everything was very predictable, i mean, how would such a intrigue end in every child's mind? The good one wins, the bad get's punished or dies. So here we only have one white hat and one black hat, nothing in between, very simple, very very stupid.Because of that, the movie quickly becomes very boring. It ends nowhere, who cares about the characters love interests, because there was no character development at all. The sound fx are mediocre, the score is terrible, badly timed and completely overblown.As the Selvig character said in one scene, Thor had just a roid rage. And now it's over and he's back home again, thank the goods.","

"shifeili","1 January 2012","It's a story a 14 year old would write. The involvement of ""usual earthlings"" in this movie was tried very stupidly. Seriously? Thor, the son of Odin falls in love with an (always perfect looking) meteorologist in about three days and then his evil brother makes this an issue in their final fight and all of them are a little bit naive so that it comes to all these? All the roles are a little overacted, as usual, but the bad brother is paiiiiiiiinfully overacted, but this must be a fault of the director, too, not only the actor - Thor and Odin must be total idiots if they'd not notice that the dark, silent always sarcastic and mean sounding guy will be a risk at some point? I know that it is the same in the Greek myths, but at least in the original stories the gods always act childish with a trigger - Thor is just acting like a 5 year old and grows to be a wise man on earth by finding love in a couple of days: Just beyond horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a soap opera with very expensive Visuals - such a waste of acting skills on some of the guys in the movie - well, this is where the money is - people like easy entertainment. I would take such a role, too, if I were a Hopkins. The love story due to bad overacting and a lack of time is very unconvincing by the way. It's alright that these movies exist in vast numbers, but I hate that people seriously try to claim that this is a good movie - it is a very nicely presented, piece of garbage - just because the picture and sound quality are very good because of a lot of money, this still is a bad movie. IMDb maybe would need some categories like the Oscars to rate the movies so that people can distinct between entertaining movies and actual pieces of the art of cinematography. This is just couch potato entertainment - hope these things get less expensive in the next years. It is a waste of money. This is just craftsmanship - and very simple. TIP: If you wanna watch a decent entertaining movie go for blockbusters around an 8,0 rating on IMDb, as these movies get rated by so many people with no clue that movies like Thor that deserve something like a 5,0 rating end up in the 7,0 area. All in all: this is not a good movie but just entertainment for lowbrow consumers - enjoy!","

"Hellrazr360","10 May 2011","This summer is shaping to be a big one for action blockbusters and sequels (with more expected this year than any preceding). We got Fast Five recently (with the sixth installment already underway), Pirates of the Caribbean's fourth outing is a couple weeks away, while July will be giving us more than just Deathly Hallows Part 2 and Transformers 3. Thankfully, we're getting some films that are at least trying to give us a tale not told in a while on-screen as well. And one of them just happens to be what is, in this writer's humble opinion, the biggest theatrical surprise since Iron Man in 2008. Seeing the trailers for Thor, I expected it to be a mediocre at-best film not far from what G.I. Joe apparently turned out to be. But then the reviews came in and, combined with urging from personal acquaintances, I succumbed to what had long-since caught others. Being almost completely unfamiliar with the tale(s) of Thor, I wasn't sure if the film would be able to truly catch and maintain my interest. Thankfully, we're given a pleasing introduction within the first act that sets the stage well without creating overexposure. Essentially, after years of battles and quests, Oden nearly bestows one of his two sons, Thor, as his proper successor. But after a thought-past threat ultimately shows what Thor is truly like, Oden banishes him to our world without his true strength (since Earth is the ideal place for the outcast).Thor (as a film) doesn't have any problem deciding what kind of film it wants to be: this is an action blockbuster with traits of an epic. The first act has some impressive visuals and an excellent action sequence that the final act actually has trouble matching. Despite the genre being clear-cut and not requiring much (if any) of an attention span, Thor thankfully manages to avoid falling into the rut that too many action releases have. By this I'm of course referring to a lack of compelling characters and, more so, an even lesser tale to tell. Most of the characters we're introduced to are nicely developed and are quite likable, with one in particular being more dimensional than audiences might anticipate. The cast here is notable, with Portman, Hopkins and SkarsgÃ¥rd all being among my personal favorite performers. Yet it's the relatively unfamiliar lead title character who steals the show (and thankfully so). With the exception of a small role in 2009's Star Trek, Chris Hemsworth was unknown to me until now. But he fits into the role of Thor perfectly, going through his personality with almost as much strength as his build. He's sure to become one to find in future action films. Thor is a very enjoyable film with just enough action and laughs to make it one that most anyone can enjoy with an open mind. While the script might show cracks here and there, namely with regards to a few lines, most of what we have here is quality material. Here's hoping that Thor proves to be a precursor to other fun summer films to take us away from our daily hardships (which is what most films should do).","

"Otterman_MK2","19 May 2011","Well, you don't need me to tell you Marvel movies have been on pretty good form lately. The Iron Man Movies were successful, and the new X-Men looks promising.As for Thor? Hammer Throwing goodness! Now, this movie is just pure entertainment. From an ancient battle on earth, to the towering city of Asguard, Thor has some very impressive background settings.The film is strongly inspired by a mixture of Roman and Viking civilisations, creating Asguard and Thor's species the Asguardian's. It is an interesting mix of alien and historic cultures, and compare's our culture to one of strict rules and responsibilities.The storyline is simple, but will keep you entertained. It is understandable if fans will see the ending as a bit of an anti-climax,but the main bulk of the film is a good mix of comedy and action, although it does have a few flaws when it comes to a slightly cheesy and unrealistic romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's character Jane. Speaking of which, I felt Natalie Portman had a slight absence of dialogue and her character seemed more like a background character rather than a secondary protagonist.Chris Hemsworth and Antony Hopkins both had outstanding performances (Hopkins goes without saying) and if the story fails, the relationship between Thor and Odin will surely keep you watching.With some nice references linking the film within the same world of Iron Man, and an ending that begins to set up Thor's relationship with Shield, I look forward to his return in the Avengers.Fan of Marvel or not, this is good old fashioned summer blockbusting.","

"tareqzaghal","2 September 2023","95% unnecessary Dutch angles and 5% bleached Hemsworth eyebrows.I wish we got an entire film that takes place only in Asgard because of how much I love the Shakespearean direction Kenneth Branagh takes here.Hemsworth shines as Thor, perfectly capturing his early arrogance, lovable mortal idiot moments, and overall larger-than-life persona. Hiddleston also steals the show as Loki from his very first appearance and is the most interesting villain of any Phase 1 stand-alone film by far. The supporting cast is also really great, especially Anthony Hopkins as Odin.The visual design of Asgard is beautiful and ethereal, a perfect contrast to the dry desert of New Mexico. The plot is simple and straightforward and is able to adequately introduce a lot of lore and mythology organically to the story, without it feeling too forced.The cinematography is terrible, with almost every shot being a Dutch angle for absolutely no reason, and it takes you out of most scenes.Overall, it's a solid origin story that feels fresh after four MCU films that all deal with scientists and the military, (the weakest parts of this film are when it also deals with scientists and the military) and expands the universe by a lot, whilst also setting up The Avengers (2012).","

In the trailer Chris Hemsworth didn't seem a ""Fanastic"" actor as he did in Home & Away but when I actually watched the movie I soon found out I was mistaken. He is an amazing actor in Thor and he takes on a whole new role that he has acted out well. Natalie Portman also had a great role in Thor and played it well. The quality of the graphics and effects was outstanding. One bit that I thought had very good effects was near the end when he was fighting he giant metal monster and when he broke the path to other worlds. The story line was good with lots of humorous parts. Some people may assume this is not a family movie, but it has no sexual content and has lots of humor for all ages.

"SebMoz","11 November 2020","Thor is arguably the one Marvel superhero I just cannot take seriously, no matter how hard I try. That has most likely something to do with the fact that I'm Norwegian, and so I take the mythology very seriously. If there is one thing the MCU doesn't need, it's the whole Asgard thing. It feels out of place to put mythology into a superhero franchise, and on top of that, I really didn't like how it looked in this film. The locations and outfits all look ridiculous, and it took a lot of enjoyment away. I also think that the story itself is rather bland. The performances are great, and the characters are alright, but it's in service of such a mindless story that is doesn't help much. The final fight towards the end also feels meaningless and unimpactful. This is definietly one of the weaker MCU movies, which I doubt I will think much about again","

"xxdoubleOxx","17 May 2011","I really don't know what these people are thinking when they say this was a great adaptation. OBVIOUSLY, they don't know enough about the character Thor. This was a horrible adaptation. But lets start with what was good I suppose.Costumes and graphics were on point. But with technology today it was absolutely nothing special. The imagination of the director was really impressive though (at least with look of Asgard). Other than that, everything was pretty... ehhhh....One thing that really got on my nerves was the downplay on Thor's intelligence. They made him seem dumb. He was pretty much the Incredible Hulk that could speak perfectly. But it was really inconsistent with the story. He understands the concepts of magic and science on earth AND makes it obvious that where he comes from they are one and the same. YET, it seemed more like he came from a time preceding that of present day earth. He reminded me of those role playing ""Renaissance people"" who take the job TOO seriously.Then you have Loki, who walks in and manipulates everything and knows everything it seems. He's many steps ahead of humans and even those in Asgard. I understand its his role to be mischievous BUT his intelligence is MUCH MUCH higher than Thor, who as I said seemed like he was dumber than the humans around him.I can go on, but the other thing that disappointed me the most about Thor was the DOWNPLAY of his powers! He's the GOD OF THUNDER and in terms of strength, arguably the MOST POWERFUL of all Avengers/Marvel characters. After watching the movie, if I had to make a comparison, SUPERMAN would PWN the S&%* out of him. Though I didn't exactly LOVE the last superman movie, the capabilities of Superman seemed endless! That's probably what disappointed me the most about the movie. Thor is capable of MUCH more and as my favorite character of Marvel, this was nothing as I expected!","

"FluffyPantsReviews","18 July 2019","Chris Hemworth is good just not great. The part when Thor is on Earth is the best part of the movie with Thor getting back his groove while battling the Destroyer. The final battle on Asgard on the rainbow bridge is beautiful but a little boring. The movie tries to go to much into the Shakespearean style of movie.","

"BA_Harrison","17 May 2014","Thor (Chris Hemsworth), arrogant son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), is stripped of his powers and banished from Asgard for disobeying his father's orders (by fighting the frost giants of Jotunheim). Landing on Midgard (or Earth, as we call it), he meets a group of scientists, falls in love with Natalie Portman, learns some humility, and defends the human race against a deadly foe, before finally returning to Asgard to face off against his deceitful brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who has since laid claim to their father's throne.I'm finally getting around to watching the standalone superhero films that paved the way for The Avengers, and I've got to say that, so far, I have much preferred the characters in their individual movies than when working as a team; this one is no exception. Thor was directed by Kenneth Branagh, which originally concerned me since he hasn't really had much experience with big budget blockbusters, but I'm happy to say that Ken did a great job, handling the material intelligently, delivering a film that gets the balance just right between drama and spectacular action.Hemsworthâ€”a relative unknown before being picked to play Thorâ€”is excellent as the hammer swinging God of Thunder, a strapping fellow who not only looks the part, but who also gives a fine central performance. Hopkins is, unsurprisingly, great as Odin, Hiddleston is suitably loathsome as the boo-hiss villain, but Portman is required to do little other than look pretty.","

"SureCommaNot","5 August 2022","This was the perfect balance of intensity and humor. You really felt the stakes, in ways that neither Ragnarok, nor Love & Thunder, came close to achieving. And this film had some of the best cinematography of Phase One; some of the shots were worthy of being framed!Perfect setup for the first Avengers film as well. And though the MCU will never again be able to achieve the feeling of inaugurating otherworldly beings, this installment solidly stands the test of time. Everyone I've ever shown this movie has loved it!","

"frogscientist","8 May 2011","Don't be mistaken, this is not the story of a fallen god, this is, rather, the story of a fallen movie director.How could the director of Dead Again and of several rather watchable Shakespeare adaptations have fallen so low? This movie is so broken beyond repair that it is hard to believe it was not designed to be that way.The characters are ridiculous and uninteresting, the psychology and the science, an insult to the viewer's intelligence, the dialogs could have been written by a 4 year old, the storyline could have been written by a 3 year old, the special effects are ugly and pointless; last but not least: the acting is so plain bad, that you believe that the director selected the worst shots on purpose. Is the lost hammer the symbol of Brannagh's lost inspiration? Is Thor's success in attaining ""worthiness"" by getting drunk in a bar a suggestion to the disparaged moviegoer?Without any hesitation, this is by far the lowest point in Marvel's movie series. (Until the foreshadowed release of the Avenger sequel....)","

"brailsford","11 November 2016","I watched the first two movies in the MCU so I wanted to be ready by watching this one as well. I wasn't as aware of the character as I was of hulk (wasn't exactly knowledgeable about Iron Man either before that movie but I knew enough about him, Thor I knew he was based on a Norse god, that was about it). After finally seeing I have to say this was a good movie. It spent more time developing the villain then the previous 2 movies (which was important given the significance of the character in coming films). The actors were all at their best (everyone had a likable personality good guy or bad guy) The movie featured good fights... some awesome visual, like- able characters and a good set up for the Avengers movies (Iron Man was OK, The Incredible Hulk... Meh...). That said it stands on it's own as a good watch and essential to watch if you're serious about watching all the MCU films.","

"shivakumar88","14 May 2011","No Spoiler!!! You will not regret watching this movie. A very well done plot and execution. The movie is backed by good CGI and performances by the actors. The only dissatisfaction that i had, was that there was more to the movie and it was over looked. More emphasis could have been laid on the time THOR spends on earth. Like i've said before, the performances by the actors has been good with the exception of Natalie Portman. I wouldn't say that her performance in the movie is bad but it's just lukewarm. May be because there has been absolutely no importance given to her character development nor much screen time given to her.However, the movie stands out to be a must watch for the story, plot, fights and good performances by most of them.","

"ZuhayrRoha","21 June 2020","Feige tried something new, got Kenneth Branagh do a Shakespearian superhero film.Thank god they casted nobodies like Hemsworth and Hiddleston, now these 2 has cemented their roles as Thor and Loki. Anthony Hopkins gave a good performance as Odin. Natalie Portman is a great actress but she lacked something.The movie does a magnificent job of world building, establishes Asgard and gave good expositions linking real life Norse Mythology and explains it through science and not only just magic. Asgard's set pieces were grand and felt real.Thor getting unworthy and going to earth for a fish-out-of-water story is a great storyline.
I really felt bad at the middle when Thor couldn't pick up the hammer.Looking back Tom Hiddleston as Loki is phenomenal. His acting of slowly working, in the back, for jealousy and planning to trap Thor to get unworthy is so great.The Shakespearian elements were great but it cuts short for Earth's story, which is also great but both mashed together didn't feel so right. Execution could have been bettetThis movie gives Thor a great character arc for worthyness but for me it felt cliche as we all knew it was ganna happen and Thor going up to the steel guy to protect his friends felt underwhelming for some reasons. The final battle of Thor and Loki was good at first watch but Loki sacrificing just for future tricks didn't work after multiple viewings.Some of the earth's character were annoying. I did like slowly building Shield in the background.The movie does a great job to set up Loki for future but inturn decrease this movies worth.","

"Boba_Fett1138","26 April 2012","Out of all the Marvel superhero movies, this was probably the least likely one to succeed. Not only does it feature a fairly unknown superhero, it also had a pretty unusual cast and crew involved. None of the sings were very promising really but as it turns out, the movie is actually one of the better, modern, superhero flicks out there! Kenneth Branagh isn't exactly a director who is known for his action- or big budgeted movies. He's a director who is more fond of direction Shakespeare- and Shakespeare type of movies. This approach and style however also proofed to be very effective for this movie. It suits the story, everything that is happening in it and its characters and dialog all very well. It also doesn't necessarily feature a typical superhero movie cast. For Thor, the unknown Chris Hemsworth got cast, who turned out to be a great choice. As a love interest, it has Natalie Portman, which doesn't sound very likely but then again, she is no usual love interest. It's a very solid character on its own, who just happens to fall for the God of thunder. It's surprising how basically everybody in this movie suits their roles so extremely well. Really, Anthony Hopkins, Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd, Tom Hiddleston, Kat Dennings, Colm Feore, Idris Elba, Rene Russo, there is not one bad casting choice in this movie, though it all still might sound a bit as an unusual cast list on paper. I would also especially like to mention Tom Hiddleston, who was perfect, in the role of the main villain Loki.It's a movie in which everything comes together surprisingly well. It's being a great mixture of several elements, such as storytelling and spectacle. It besides manages to find a great balance between the scenes that are taking place on Earth and the ones taking place at Asgard. Both are completely different from each other, with each different 'rules' and visual styles. Yet it all blends in with each other perfectly and the movie feels like one big whole.It's a surprising spectacular movie, which is also really thanks to its vivid visuals. Asgard looks fantastic and the so do all of the movie its other effects. It's a real special effects heavy movie but the effects often are not necessarily just there to impress but also to help to tell its story and create a wonderful atmosphere for the movie.Besides, the movie is also being a very classy one. It has some great cinematography and it's obvious that often the emphasis of the filmmakers got put on its actors and their performances and delivery of their lines. It results in often some great dialog and performances by its cast, that help to keep the movie going and great, fun and compelling enough to watch, at all times.Really not much wrong with this movie and it quite honestly is among the best and also most surprising superhero movies of recent years.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"franhevi","30 April 2011","I thought the character of Thor would make a ridiculous lousy film but, surprisingly for good, Branagh applies his shakespearean expertise to deliver a great story beautifully told.There's a couple of cheesy lines but I guess they're needed to appeal to a younger audience. Action sequences are just great, seeing Thor fight is a thrill.If you're a Marvel fan, keep your eyes open for tons of easter eggs. Nerdgasm.I wouldn't recommend watching it in 3D, by the way. Not worth it.8/10---SPOILER ALERT---There's a reference to Bruce Banner in the film. When it happened I instantly thought of Ed Norton; I'm not sure if building all this expectation and then showing the audience a Dr. Banner with a different face will work. Still looking forward to The Avengers, though.","

"haris_manda","7 May 2011","I went to watch this movie with two friends after I saw trailer (which was too late for premiere, but at least I got it to watch in cinema) and I was blown away. Of course, it was not something that will be the crown of the world for a long time, but it is something you enjoy in the very moment and afterwards. First of all, effects. I mean, it does not do all to film, but it IS first thing you notice among all others. It's truly epic, and there's no other word to describe it. Amazing fight at almost very beginning, and so on, brings things to really new level. Going on, acting. I was really unfamiliar with Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) but they brought characters to life, and I mean it. I mean, it does not happen very often that some acting blow me away, but this did. I just assume that they used given chance, brought up epicness of the story, and did the best they could - it was great. I didn't doubt in Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins performance, and they showed me why.Going on, story is quite well presented on screen. I was never actually fan of Marvel's strips, and I'm not very familiar with many of them, but as far as other reviews, they did amazing job. This epic story is not something that will teach you valuable lesson in your life, but it will return the betrayal lesson you all should have in your minds. It is not, also, film that will stick into cinemas for a half a year or something, but it is definitely film that will provide great time watching it with friends. There is a lot of humor, which is by the way really good, and scenes that will make you think about things you've never taught before. I gave 8/10, and I think that this IMDb ranking does honor to this movie.","

"oscar-35","6 February 2013","*Spoiler/plot- Thor, 2011. Based on the Marvel Comic character, this film follows Thor's exploits in Asguard and on Earth with friends and foes.*Special Stars- Anthony Hopkins, Renee Russo, Chris Hemsworth.*Theme- When you're sure you're right, go forward without any worries...*Trivia/location/goofs- Locations in New Mexico. Be sure not to miss for the Stan Lee Camoe role in this film of a truck driving rancher. Also the 'stinger' after the end titles has a set-up for the next film, The Avengers.*Emotion- As a ardent follower of this Marvel comic book character many years ago, I considered this film to be mediocre and disappointing. I would have liked this big film to be more on about the characters & plot and less on the battle action. This film seems to be more directed to adolescent boys and fanboy adults. The additional great casting of Hopkins and Russo in important roles seems to be wasted here. It was enjoyable for one viewing.","

"gradyharp","14 September 2011","Not being a fan of Marvel Comics or of the endless transformations into cinema that these silly stories are seeing, THOR was not high on the list to view. Seeing it without the 3D variation that accompanied the theatrical release was a further detriment in deciding to watch it, but when a director of the caliber of Kenneth Branagh and a cast of both seasoned performers and exciting new faces pass the credit notification then it is tempting to give it a try. The surprise is that this is a very entertaining movie. There is a lot of CGI business that probably in 3D was even more beautiful (the rainbow bridge, the ice realm etc), but even in regular vision the sets and designs are truly beautiful. Some viewers might expect a version of the Viking gods adventure, but this is clearly a fairy tale version - tripping between the earth realm and the home of the gods, and that in and of itself make the film more enjoyable: it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously and that is refreshing. Odin (Anthony Hopkins) rules Asgard and has two sons - Thor (Chris Hemsworth, an Adonis with a very magnetic screen presence) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - by his devoted wife Frigga (Rene Russo). Odin is about to pass his crown to Thor when the latter makes some wrong decisions and is cast out of the kingdom and lands in New Mexico where he encounters a scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik Selvig (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) and weirdo friend Darcy (Kat Dennings). From Jane, Thor learns kindness, compassion and love and has become more the son that Odin desired. Meanwhile back at home Loki is taking over (being the true son of King Laufey (Colm Feore) and as Odin lies dying Thor's buddies - Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Josh Dallas, a real find!), and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) with a bit of help from the gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) - descend to earth to aid Thor is becoming the quality of king he should be, etc etc In addition to the named cast there is a very very brief appearance by Jeremy Renner that just may be a signal that the followup THE AVENGERS will be around soon. The movie has a lot going for it, especially it the audience can sit back and enjoy the comic book atmosphere of this mixture of make believe and real life people. It is surprisingly successful!

"Forcerlo","21 April 2011","Going to see this film i had very mixed expectations. I liked the costumes and look when viewing the trailer however i thought the acting looked forced and i thought the trailer gave too much of the plot away. However most of my fears were put to rest when the movie started. The tone of the film was excellent and pulled off the mythological themes well. Odin looked great and Anthony Hopkins gave a good performance, as did Natalie Portman who gave her usual high standard. Tom Hiddlestone did excellent as Loki, it was amazing to see him come alive from the comic book. The star of this film though is Hemsworth I was so ambivalent regarding his performance coming into the film. But he exceeded my expectations and lived up to how I envisioned Thor would look, act, talk and fight. All the while I was thinking how awesome he would be clashing so glaringly alongside Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and Steve Rogers. I am pumped for the Avengers! The bad though is the plot is a little unambitious and his time on Earth needed more time to develop. All in all the tone of the film was excellent and gave us a Superhero film that did not cause any huge revelation in the way Superhero films should be done, it did give us another fresh revised feel to the genre much like Iron Man did back in 2008.","

"kdnor2011","4 January 2012","Thor seems like a movie that should have been really really bad when you hear the premise. The God of Thunder is punished by his father for disobeying him. So he sends him to Earth where he meets a college student and falls in love. Meanwhile his father has fallen ill and Thor's brother, who becomes evil, takes over as king. Yeah, doesn't really sound like it would turn out good, but surprisingly it came out pretty well.I think the only reason this movie worked as well as it did was because they played it so over the top. Everything is overblown, and that's why the film is entertaining. It's downright hilarious in a few parts. Had they taken itself as seriously as The First Iron Man, or the first two-thirds of the Incredible Hulk this film would have been a disasaster.The character's themselves are fine, Thor starts out as a bit of an ass, but since they play it so over the top I didn't mind it as much as Iron Man. The villain was pretty cool. And I really liked Darcy, I don't know why exactly, but I just really liked her.However, because the film is so over the top, when it does try to take itself seriously, it doesn't always work. Sometimes it just comes off as unintentionally hilarious. Other problems I have: the action is too short at times and too few of them. But like I said, it's funny enough to where I forgive that. I didn't like how quickly Thor just adjusted to human life. This may be a spoiler, but after Loki tells him his father is dead and he can't return, he mopes for one night, and then seems like he's perfectly happy with it. Come on Thor you can't get over this that quickly.Really this film just didn't blow me away. It was entertaining, but there was only one part where I was really impressed. That was the scene at the end of the credits. I won't spoil it, but of all the pre-Avengers movies post credits scenes, this one is my favorite","

"thesar-2","8 May 2011","Hammer time will have to wait for The Avengers movie.This feature length version of Thor and his origins was only marginally better than Marvel's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Spider-Man 3 and Daredevil. That's not saying much when you factor in the better Marvel films: Spider-Man 1-2, Iron Man 1-2, X-Men 1, 2, 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Fantastic Four 1, Hulk and Incredible Hulk and Blade 1, 2, 3. Hmmm. Of the 18 Marvel movies (including Thor) I mentioned, that means, Thor ranks as 15/18.That's not good. Nevertheless, if you're slightly curious, or like CGI-laced movies a lot more than I do, check it out. I wouldn't waste the extra fee for 3D or IMAX, like I did unfortunately, but it's harmless comic-book entertainment. And be forewarned: DO NOT STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS for that extra teaser they've been known to get people hyped for The Avengers movie. At the end of this review, I will SPOIL IT to save you the extra time. Heck, the movie's too darned long anyways.The movie immediately begins with Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman as Jane Foster who's studying with her colleagues in the New Mexican desert and inadvertently runs into banished Thor (a gorgeous Chris Hemsworth â€“ one of the few pluses of the movie). But wait! How did he get dropped into the desert?Well, thanks for asking. Over the next 45 minutes or so, you'll learn the background story of Thor, his King Daddy Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his oh-so-mysterious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston â€“ one of the many negatives of the movie.) They run the realm of the good guys, and they don't like the ice baddies who want to make everything and everywhere cold. Their leader must've lived in Phoenix, AZ at one point and for that, we will take their side.The story appears on the surface as kind of complicated, but deeper, it's almost as basic as can be. Thor leads his misfit friends after the ice giants and thus gets banished to Earth â€“ full circle â€“ and now we're back to Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman and her interest in alternative universes and of course, hunk of a man Thor, himself. He, however, is battling everyone to get his precious star-laced Hammer back. Unfortunately, he must learn to be humble to get it back..blah blah blahÂ…I never bought his transformation, I just wish there were more of super-powered Thor and the not ""Oh, can't we all get along"" idiot they put on the screen.The performances were okay. One in six jokes worked. The graphics were decent â€“ MUCH better than 2010's Clash of the Titans. The only thing I looked forward to, aside from seeing the breathtaking Chris Hemsworth on screen, was the never-ending The Avengers/S.H.I.E.L.D./other superheroes either seen or mentioned. There were a lot, but it was welcomed as I was more interested in the ""coming attractions"" and less involved with the actual film I was watching.Again, recommended for the curious, and not recommended for those few that are, to stay through the final credits.(And as promised, SPOILER, here's what you'll see after the seemingly 15-minutes of creditsÂ… one of the scientists, Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) who worked with Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman's Jane is invited into an underground bunker to meet with, yep, you guessed it: Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) again. Nicky wants to use this power cube, but doesn't understand it and Erik is mucho curious about it untilÂ…we find out he's Thor's evil brother Loki in disguise. Yawn. NOT WORTH IT. Couldn't you have shown Thor VS. (or at least, meets) Hulk? Or even Iron Man (in the suit) going at Thor? Sorry, I love Samuel L. Jackson as much as the next human, but enough. Give us something we haven't seen.)Oh, and by the way, I hope someone had noticed the ""Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman"" as sarcasm. And that's another discussion","

Digital editing is so cheap, I have no idea how they managed to attract actual actors to a movie that may scare the hell out of children below the age of 4, but would clearly be a laughing stock to anyone above that age. The actor who makes a poor attempt to 'play' his role must be attractive to people with a room temperature IQ. Really funny stuff include his huge shiny hammer of a dumb name and all his friends of no character. There is no story development of any kind.

This movie surprised me. Didn't think it was gonna be this good when I went to see it, but every detail amused me and my family very much. Only downside is that they apparently speak English in Asgard. Wished they had done something like they did in Avatar and Lord of the Rings, inventing their own language.

"Starlitelet","24 May 2011","First of all, I am superhero fan. I research on superheroes that interest me during my spare time. However, I never get a chance to read the comics or more likely, I am lazy. Nonetheless, I am quite acquainted with the mainstream heroes and their groups, such as, Batman, Spiderman, Hulk, Superman, X-Men, Justice League and etc. However, only was it until Iron Man came out that I took notice into The Avengers. Then came along Thor and and news of Chris Hemsworth playing the character.I had no idea what to expect from Hemsworth, since I am not familiar with his work. In all honesty, I had no idea what to expect from this movie at all. I read some reviews and most of them were positive. And since I am a skeptical woman, I went to my Marvel encyclopedia and searched up Thor. He did not seem like an interesting character, or to be more general, none of The Avengers seemed intriguing.I remember seeing Hulk, my first Avenger hero movie. I was not hugely astounded with Hulk. I am not talking about the movie because the recent Hulk movie (The Incredible Hulk) was entertaining, but it just didn't move me. Perhaps, Hulk is not my type of protagonist/hero.However, the same scenario happened with Iron Man. Though, I got to say Iron Man had some witty dialogues which made it more entertaining. Nonetheless, I was unable to attach myself to Tony Stark's character for some reason.Acting: These two previous superheroes link to Thor because oddly enough, I was able to relate to this lad. His transformation from being arrogant and stupid to noble and warm-hearted made him more endearing. I believe this fine performance and great character representation is thanks to Chris Hemsworth. Even though I do not know much about Thor, Hemsworth made the story and character seem realistic and smooth in a magical sense. Awesome acting from Hemsworth, by the way. Tom Hiddleston as Loki also left a positive impression. I liked the fact that he wasn't purely evil like most clichÃ©s, where the evil brother just makes you hate them for no reason. As a matter of fact, I actually felt sorry for him. I thought the other performances were average. They did not make the movie much better, but thanks to their believability and successful deliverance of the character, the storyline was able to flow properly. On a side note, I did not find Kat Dennings to be annoying. I thought she definitely added humor into the movie, which is a bonus. Oh and yes, Natalie Portman along with Jaimie Alexander are also eye candies for men.9/10Storyline: The plot was well grounded in general. The beginning really ensnared me into Asgard. The battle near the beginning against the Frostbites was thrilling and exciting. However, the story slightly went downhill after Thor was banished to Earth. After a few laughs and giggles because of Thor's naivety in the human world and the comments from Dennings, the storyline fell flat by a bit. It might ruin it for some people, but I did not mind the slow paced delivery because I thought it delved more into Thor's character. However, I must say that he transformed too quickly. Now that I have mentioned it, his relationship with Jane Foster felt rushed. Like, why were they together in the first place? I know that she was sent to him to make him become a better man, but they didn't really show how SHE made him the way he is now. Though, I must admit, I was smiling in the theater when they were exchanging conversations. Cute couple. Now, back to the storyline, it's obviously different from previous superhero films, since Thor already possess godly powers. What am I saying? He is a God. This factor made it different than most comic based movies. The way they show the Asgardians landing on Earth with their full armors on was also funny.There were no subplots other than some scenes linking to the Avengers and Shields. I also thought the little scene with Hawkeye was unessential. For people that do not know Hawkeye, will be like, ""why does that guy have a bow and not a gun?"" 8/10Special Effects: Asgard looked beautiful. It reminded me of the Final Fantasy games. I thought the armors looked goofy from the trailers, but for the most part, it turned out decorous and mighty looking. There were also major details in the background. The battle between the Frost giants and Thor and his friends at the beginning looked stunning. Kenneth Branagh executed the shots very well. However, when Thor's friends came to Earth, they looked oddly misplaced. Their armors looked fake.9/10Entertainment: Bottom line, I thought Thor was massively entertaining. I am also a fan of Greek mythology and it opened me up to Norse mythology which I thought was delicately incorporated. Thor actually reminded me of Zeus. This whole incorporation of Asgard and Earth made me question about science and magic also. I am a dreamer, so the fact that they touched on this binary made it more pleasing. Moreover, it is not my favorite superhero film, but definitely one of my top few. I thought it was slightly better than Iron Man, since it was better paced. However, Thor contained cheesy elements that could have been mended. Iron Man was more intellectual thanks to the script, but not eye pleasing or heart mending enough except for Stark's highly advanced suit and weapons. I also felt like Thor had more heart and not just good special effects. Nonetheless, something was missing that Spiderman and Batman had, but Thor did not. The movie Thor and not the character was just not catchy/memorable enough, especially for those who are not into superhero movies and mythology or fantasy. It still provides a load of entertainment! 9.5/10","

"ThunderKing6","14 October 2020","I think if the mcu wasn't a connected movie series Thor would have been so much better. It would have been more in dept, emotion, better sets and it wouldn't feel rushed.
It would have given you a Lord of The Rings feel.Thor 1 is great for its time and for its attempt. Compare Thor 1 to Hobbit, Lord of the Rings or even World Of War Craft. Thor 1 looks like cheap plastic.The whole story was rushed just for Avengers 1.Thor loses his power after killing an army which was caused by his brother and Thor only gets 1 day punishment after learning so fast?
(Thor has the same problem that Dr. Strange had. Too fast pacing)
It was a slap on the wrist.The fight scenes were minor. The first fight in ice land was great. The earth fight was too quick. The final with his brother wasn't bad.Overall, Chris has become my most notable actors after Thor. He has done a great job with the character. That's really nothing like the comics.Loki was great in Thor 1.

Nevertheless, this film is an enjoyable ride for either long-time Thor fans or novices of Norse/Marvel mythology. Plus, it is a good setup for The Avengers film. Ker-Smash!","

"DKosty123","22 May 2020","First write a great script - Stan the man and the 5 writers handle that. Then get an 28 year old 6' 3"" hunk and put 2 very good cast people around him. This adds up to Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, & Natalie Portman . Add Tom Hiddleston 30 year young talent as Loki whose great. This one is a winner, all the way. Kenneth Branagh does a fine job directed this one too.As for the plot, well any writer fan of Thor and Stan Lee comic should find it a labor of love. Sure enough, this script comes off that way. There's good humor all the way through and dramatic moments for Hopkins Odin plus the some special moments.A throw back moment for me is the scene with the attack on the town. Kind of reminded me of Superman 2 though the Destroyer is much more effective than the 3 were in that movie. Lodi really designed one tough machine.As is normal for Marvel, they introduce Shield run by the government in this one. There are other characters introduced along the way. The great thing though is the immediate talent shown by the younger male actors with the more experienced crew. The casting director hit the jack pot here. Enjoy this one and watch at the end for some extra credits. There's more to Thor than meets the eye, even though his first film is a lot calmer than you'd expect.The effects and the 9 USA filming locations are used well in advancing the story. The cast chemistry goes along really well. It ends with the usual ""well maybe I will see her again."" Portman is only 2 years older than Thor, but she is more experienced than him. Here though it is rated PG for Pretty Great. Darn, it's hard to believe Portman is turning 40 soon. How did that happen?","

"OllieSuave-007","14 June 2016","This is a fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping Marvel film featuring the super god Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who was cast out of his home on Planet Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) for his arrogance and sent to live on Earth with the humans. He tries to blend in and meets scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), learning the lessons of humanity from her and falling in love - all the while dealing with a super villain from his homeland that has come to wreck havoc on Earth.Thor is nonstop action, from the mighty warrior fighting the Frost Giants on his home planet to him joining forces with his warrior comrades - Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Josh Dallas), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) - to battle the super villain on Earth. This movie is also nonstop suspense, from U.S. government agents poking around investigating Thor's weapon and presence on Earth to Odin delivering some family drama in the story.There is plenty of decent and spectacular special effects to highlight the tension in the plot, as well as a good dose of comic relief where appropriate, though, some was overdone at certain points, courtesy of the blabbermouth Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings).The movie is a little too high on the CGI, but, the graphics were beautiful and blends in well with the visual effects at least. The acting was mostly good, with good chemistry between Hemsworth and Portman, and great action teamwork with Stevenson, Dallas, Asano and Alexander.It's a great superhero film, overall, and one of the better ones from Marvel.Grade A-","

"FilmFanatic03","28 April 2011","There was something different about ""Thor"". Whilst not being the best super-hero film in the world, it was a great one and the best one since ""The Dark Knight"". However it was the first one in a while where it was a full on fantasy super-hero film where there are no possibilities and their powers are shown in a great way. There was a great balance of how much the Asgardian world was shown and how Earth was shown. Chris Hemsworth played the arrogant turned humble god Thor, however i think the star of the film was Tom Middleston for his acting had more depth expected from a super-hero film. Natalie Portman was OK, nothing amazing but nothing awful. Overall a good cast to bring to life a great film. Also the amazing thing worth noting is that there is no sexual scenes or strong language! See, you can have no swear words or rude scenes and you can still enjoy a great film!","

"tieman64","29 August 2011","Kenneth Branagh directs ""Thor"", a superhero movie which mixes the director's fondness for William Shakespeare (and theatre) with big budget, CGI, superhero, comic book nuttiness. Ironically, it's the film's Shakespearean aspects â€“ a ""King Lear"" inspired narrative in which Gods and Wizards jostle for power and plot against one another whilst a wise King divides his kingdom between sons, outcasts and half-breeds â€“ which work horribly. Probably because it's fundamentally impossible to take such ""high brow drama"" seriously when everyone is wearing underwear, capes and standing on glowing rainbows. It would take a genius to conceive of a believable ""trans-dimensional landscape"" in which alien beings, Gods and lords can convincingly frolic whilst quoting The Bard.Still, the film's other subplot, which takes the form of a culture-clash comedy in which the mighty Thor bumbles about contemporary America whilst a chirpy Natalie Portman lusts after his heavenly body, works well. Think such ""fish out of water"" comedies like Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Hercules in New York"", ""The Voyage Home"", ""The Terminal"", ""Moscow on the Hudson"" or ""Time After Time"", and you've got an idea of what Branagh is tapping into. This aspect of the film is cute, but not worth suffering the director's Greco-mythological train wreck.Like most super hero movies, the overriding theme is proto-fascist: ""how to wield absolute power benevolently"".6/10 - Worth one viewing. See Branagh's underrated ""Frankenstein"".","

"CuriosityKilledShawn","1 May 2011","Whoever thought Kenneth Branagh, the man who once gave us a 4-hour long 70mm adaptation of Hamlet, would take a stab at a comic-book movie? I've never read a Thor comic in my life, nor have I been exposed to any other Thor material, so walking into this movie was my introduction to the character. As an outsider to this side of the Marvel universe, I have to admit that the opening 20 minutes are very hard to follow. But as soon as Thor is banished from Asgaard and dumped on Earth, things pick up considerably.There's plenty of fun to be had (in the vein of Crocodile Dundee) as Thor bumbles his way through human life, encountering the underused and sort-of miscast Natalie Portman, the awesome Stellan Skarsgard, and the cute Kat Dennings. But any time the film cuts back to Asgaard it stops dead. The conspiracy involving the Frost Giants was boring and nearly incomprehensible. I'm disappointed that this is the best story they could come up with to carry the movie. It just didn't hook me.I'm growing tired of comic-book movies, but at least Thor didn't have to go down the old 'origin story' path, it gets a few extra points for that. But I'm afraid the fun of the Earth-bound half of the film is crippled by the dull Asgaard plot.And the converted 3D is awful too. Stick with the 2D version people, you'll save yourself a headache. It might have been worth it if Kat Dennings got her ample cleavage out, but she doesn't!","

"g-bodyl","5 February 2013","In the road leading up to the Avengers, Marvel continues to release above-average superhero films and ones with mighty hearts. Thor continues that trend because it's a really good movie. There are great visuals, great characters to relate to, and just a good time.Kenneth Branagh's film is about a God of Thunder, Thor who is cast away from Asgard with no powers because of his arrogance. He meets Jane and her scientist friends and teams up with them so he can find his way back home. But there is a certain Loki who just might try to stop that...Chris Hemsworth plays a really good Thor in his first leading role in film. He plays the arrogant part very well. Loki is not the meanest villain out there but he is still effective as the villain trying to look innocent in the eyes of his people. This movie has such an impressive cast for the kind of film it is.Overall, this is another good superhero film that has good action and very good visual effects/production design. Now, I do not like to call critics out especially Roger Ebert since he is my favorite. But, I have no idea why he was so outspoken against this film. I thought this is a very good film that has me really excited for the sequel and the Avengers. I rate this film 9/10.","

"jouvenaz","2 May 2011","There's really not enough curses in the world to describe this piece of drab uninspired humdrum. This movie rates a full star out of ten for two reasons: Natalie Portman is hot One star is the lowest possible ratingThe movie starts with a long and superfluous intro, which is frankly boring. It's a fight scene where neither 3D nor special effects work well. Fast forward 1000 years and nobody has learned anything. Natalie Portman is hot, Thor is ripped, the story is lame. Everything is third rate until the guardian comes to earth, when finally we see some descent pyrotechnics. The fights lack choreography, the explosions lack oomph, there's neither character development nor dialogue.Listless, wantonly commercial sequels like Spiderman 3, Star Wars 4,5,6, Blade 3, etc beat this overly expensive monstrosity of failure hands down. I've said it before about ""love and other drugs"" and I'll say it again about ""Thor"": I go to the cinema for free, and I still wanted my money back. Thor cost me two hours of my life that I'll never get back again.","

"The-Last-Prydonian","2 May 2011","With just one more movie to go before next years big screen adaptation of Marvel comics ""The Avengers"" hits the big screen ""Thor"", the penultimate film in the Marvel chain of films that makes up one quarter of the Avengers team that acts as a precedent to what is to come. Preceded by ""Iron Man"" and It's sequel as well as 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" reboot, not one of those films (although none of which were bad) were anything close to remarkable. So with this in mind I have to admit that my hopes for ""Thor"" weren't incredibly high but I decided to at least give it a chance and watch the movie with an open mind. However once again I can't say that my expectations were not confirmed.The set up which is plain and simple enough is this, King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) rules over the world of Asgard. A realm where magic and science are one and the same. His people defend the nine realms from the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and in defending the Norse people of Earth in 970 AD they come to be worshipped as Gods. In the present Odin has two sons Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Thor(Chris Hemsworth) who will one day take his father's place and ascend the throne of Asgard. When a group of Frost Giants invade their kingdom in a failed bid to retrieve the Casket of Ancient Winters which was taken from them by the Asgaridans after their defeat over a millennia ago. Thor demands that an example must be made of their icy foes. Going against the orders of Odin he leads a band of his friends to confront them ultimately leading to a war which enrages Odin who strips Thor of his powers and exiles him to Earth. It is on Earth he is eventaully forced to redeem himself and become Earth's greatest defender while befriending scientist Jane Foster (Nathalie Portman)As a film ""Thor"" marks a departure for it's director Kenneth Brangah who up until now has been concerned mainly with helming serious drama's as well as his trademark inclination for adapting Shakespeare's plays to the big screen. I was intrigued how he would cope with handling a big budget fantasy/adventure movie and It's to his credit that he does an admirable job. His handling of the fight scenes is top notch and are well choreographed where upon the cinematography fits in well with the flow of the action. While the more light hearted moments of the script compliment the overall feel of the film which means it never takes itself too seriously. The fish out of water moments where Thor explores the new world that he has found himself banished strike the right chord and are handled with good natured charm. As Thor Chris Hemsworth is equal parts charismatic and charming while portraying the acquired level of cockiness so that he makes a affable yet flawed hero who doesn't fall beyond the way side in to caricature. He also proves to also be adept at the more physical aspects. The supporting cast are also solid with Nathalie Portman proving to be likable and touches the right note of sincerity as Jane, while being a neat foil to Hemsworth with Anthony Hopkins providing a commanding and wise presence as Odin. But the break through performance for me has to go to Tom Hiddleston who is fantastic as Loki. He really makes you believe in Thor's stepbrother if at times you find yourself struggling to completely swallow everything due to the slightly leaky script. I am keen to see how his career will progress on the back of ""Thor"" as he he is someone who I think might have a promising career ahead of him.What lets the film down is It's flat, routine plot which is overstepped by of the action and the overall grandeur spectacle. The sub-plot regarding Thor's road to redemption meanders in to clichÃ© and is therefore predictable, relying on his trademark hammer as a threadbare tool to punctuate the point. Some of the characterisation from some of the supporting characters is a little too hammy and a bit thin on the ground and seem at times to be nothing more than window dressing to help further the progression of the films narrative. I also found myself not being able to reconcile myself to the motivations of Loki who the film tries to inject some depth in to him which goes beyond that of being a mere villain and that of a tragic figure but it doesn't come off as the least bit convincing. It's easier to envisage Loki as being a man driven by greed and ambition rather than that of a despondent antagonist left rocked by the sudden revelation that his father has been forced to impart on him. Triggering him to further an agenda to prove his inner worth. The presence of SHIELD, the government agency seen previously in ""Iron Man 2"" is only there to generate some action and create an obstacle to Thor retrieving his magical hammer which has been sent to Earth along with him. Anything other than that it just seems like they factor in as plot set up to next years Avengers movie and offer little else to the films plot making them largely obligatory. An overawing experience for non-fans although I suspect those more familiar with the comics will find more to like. I wouldn't bet my hopes on the film finding a wider appeal beyond it's fandom on the strengths of it. As this type of film goes It's inoffensive enough and passes the time and has It's colourful. little flourishes to commend it. However It's just another by the numbers blockbuster that ends up putting It's money where it's heart should be.","

"wookietower","15 April 2019","I re-watched this film yesterday as part of my effort to refresh my memory on the MCU prior to Endgame and while this one served its purpose as the origin story for Thor, it seems dated now and not nearly as good a film as others in the MCU. Watching this again in 2019, this movie looks like it was shot in the 1990's and has almost a Michael Bay type feeling to it. All of those slanted camera angles and quick shots during the action made it look out of touch.
Also (and I've seen other comments on this) the romantic sub-plot between Thor and Jane was just out of place and unnecessary in this film. I'm not that familiar with how their relationship was in the comics, but I realize there was some love interest between the two but it just seemed like an afterthought here and not done well.
Still, it sets the stage for the first Avengers film and does a good enough job with introducing Loki, Thor and the rest of Asgard to the MCU.","

I get it, and I get why a lot of people are probably ga-ga about the choice, but Thor would be better off if he came across as more intelligent (and higher emotional IQ). Thor is supposed to be incredibly strong but not a derpy brute.Maybe I'm being too harsh. The fact of the matter is that the way the movie was done, you find yourself rooting way more for Loki, who is absolutely terrific.Have a spin-off with just Loki, and it'd prob be a ten.","

Then the Avengers Next! Man I feel like a kid again. All these action comic films bring back the memories of reading comics and wishing there were good films to match. If anyone remembers the 70's attempts at these characters you know how great it is to finally have good versions of some of these HEROES! Keep it up.

"artistofthemind","11 May 2011","As the first installment of the upcoming Avengers movie, Thor was said to be one of the first great hits of the summer. The trailer is edited with just the right amount of action, humor, and dramatic moments. I try to give Hollywood the benefit of the doubt when it comes to showing all the best parts in the trailer, but recently they have been letting me down. The 3D was incredible, even though it was post-converted, but it was easy enough due to the fact that all the shots of Asgard (Thor's home world) were CG, and fifty percent of the movie was that. Still, props to this one - it's one of the first live-action movies to *almost* pull off the 3D.But still, this movie lacked. There were three holes in it that, from an artist's point of view, cannot be overlooked. A relationship that motivates a character, that is his driving force, and creates the ending as a byproduct, needs to be developed. Not thrown together, not seen as ""He's Thor! And that's Natalie Portman, of course it would happen!"" Terrible excuse, Hollywood. A romance that permeates a story like that cannot be put on a back-burner. Secondly, in a movie that is supposed to be epic enough to draw the audience back for Captain America and all these other Avengers movies, well, rule number one; your biggest battle cannot be in the first fifteen minutes. And last of all, if you're going to make these basic formulaic mistakes in making a movie...at least have the heart to make your music halfway decent.I have been jumped all over by the people I work with at the theater for not liking this movie. Granted, these are the people that loved Green Hornet, but that is for another day. Still, they believe Thor to be an excellent movie (even watching it in 2D...they don't like 3D) to such an extent that I am seen as insane not to like this. Strange, I think I heard that after Green Hornet as well. The truth is, I view movies as an art form, not just entertainment. I have the respect for my fellow artists not to expect anything but the best of them. So far, Hollywood is proving me wrong.","

I'd say of the early movies this was the most original and the one that I personally enjoyed the mostThe weird mix of Norse mythology and super hero tropes, science and magic, as silly as it is on closer inspection, works surprisingly well. Like all the early marvel movies it strikes a good balance between humor and drama. Thor's interaction with modern society is pure gold and his brother Loki is for sure one of the most fleshed out and interesting antagonists in the MCU.Some twists seem a little cheap, however, and the powers and limitations of each character aren't always clear, which may cause confusion and makes this movie fall just short of achieving true greatness.","

All the main issues touched have been scrutinized in so many movies, that Thor became just another ""sparrow on the line""...Of course, as the budget was high, the donors and lenders seemed to want to act for certain: different races, genders and ages were carefully picked.

"jon.h.ochiai","8 May 2011","In the climactic battle of brother against brother, Loki (amazing Tom Hiddleston) confesses to Thor (commanding Chris Hemsworth), ""I never wanted to be King. I only wanted to be your equal!"" That arc captures the surprising greatness and ambition of Director Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"". Branagh, who is known more for his Shakespearean adaptations, is an unlikely candidate for ""Thor"", based on the beloved Marvel superhero. However, here Branagh's Shakespearean sensibilities well serve ""Thor"". ""Thor"" is mesmerizing as it retells the Norse Mythology of Odin and Asgard. ""Thor"" tells the timeless story of sons vying for their father's love, and betrayal. ""Thor"" at its summit is classic Greek Tragedy, like the best comic book heroes. This is so unexpected given the numerous screen and story writers involved: Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne, J. Michael Straczynski, and Mark Potosevich. The source material is the comic book by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby.""Thor"" is defiantly engrossing. It is also so well acted with Academy Award Winners Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Natalie Portman as intrepid scientist Jane Foster. Both command gravitas, especially Hopkins. Rene Russo strongly plays Odin's wife devoted Frigga. Tom Hiddleston virtually steals the movie as the duplicitous Loki. He brilliantly balances villainy and tragedy. Idris Elba is powerful and noble as gold armored Gatekeeper Heimdall. Newcomer Chris Hemsworth is charismatic and surprisingly charming and funny. The dude is classically handsome with blonde mane and chiseled body. I had read how he trained for ""Thor""-- he looks amazing. He is a great action guy as he dispatches S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents like nothing. More impressive than his ripped abs, is his screen presence, and he holds his own with Hopkins. He and Hopkins have a visceral chemistry. In a touching scene Thor admits to his Father Odin, ""Someday perhaps, I shall make you proudÂ…"" In that moment I was reminded of Hopkins and Brad Pitt in ""Meet Joe Black"".In ""Thor"", Thor (Hemsworth) is a reckless, vain, and arrogant warrior and god. He is Odin's favorite son, and that wounds the very soul of his brother Loki (Hiddleston). Thor is next in line to King Odin. We learn from Norse mythology that Asgard maintains a truce with their mortal enemies the Frost Giants, lead by malevolent King Laufey (darkly seething Colm Feore), following a legendary battle with Odin. Outraged by terrorist interruption of his ascension Thor leads his loyal group of warriors along with Loki to engage the Frost Giants. His rashness threatens all out war in the Realms. Odin says, ""You are a vain greedy, cruel boy."" Thor strikes back, ""You are an old man, and a fool!"" Odin banishes his son Thor to Earth. His mighty hammer Mjollnir also plummets to the deserts of New Mexicoâ€”as we recall from ""Iron Man 2"". Only the one deserving to wield the power of Thor can raise the hammer. Scattered genius Dr. Jane Foster (Portman) literally crashes into earth bound Thor. Jane and her team, Erik (Stellen Skarsgard) and Darcy (funny Kat Dennings), have been tracking repeated cosmic disturbances in the desert.Geeky and klutzy Jane resists her attraction to the hunky Thor. Shocking. At the same time, the Government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and Agent Coulson (deft straight man Clark Gregg) isolate Thor's hammer in a covert operation of grave national security. They also confiscate all of Jane's research. There is some funny fish out of water humor at Thor's expense. As much as Erik does not want to admit, all things point to the Norse God of Thunder. Thor gives his Viking word of honor to Jane, knowing that he endangers them both.Back in Asgard, the conflicted Loki is both beholding to and jealous of his brother. He so fiercely desires the love and approval of his father. Loki confirms the tragic betrayal from Odin, who then falls gravely ill. Hiddleston is powerful as Loki perpetuates a lie. He dearly loves his brother, but he cannot forgive his perceived betrayal. In this ""Thor"" soars. The weakness in ""Thor"" resides in the Earth bound story. Granted ""Thor"" is a predictable transformation and surrender of courage and humility. However, the love story of Thor and Jane is the least evolved. I think in the classic story of the Hero, Director Branagh intended this to be a source of power, but perhaps this got lost in the editing. What remains is still great and compelling. ""Thor"" is heroic tragedy with its tale of a Father's love, and brother's betrayal. Hopkins, Hemsworth, and Hiddleston are awesome in Branagh's Shakespearean rendering of ""Thor"".","

"grumpy-3","20 April 2011","firstly the 3d conversion is utterly pointless, makes the film look very wishy washy, now to the main complaints, this is a film about a super hero, well, he is actually Thor for about 12 minutes in a two hour movie. the rest of the time is spent in utter drivel, too much time on the human characters, we see Thor fly and use his hammer in one short action sequence at the start and again another one at the end, inbetween is boring relationship stuff and not good comedy, the actors are great the look is good, but please just stick to the comics. another origins story that we do not need, i grew up loving Thor probably my favourite of the marvel heroes, and wanted to see him being Thor, for most of this movie he has lost his powers and is actually almost secondary to the story, who writes this stuff, why do we need all this backstory rubbish, Star wars showed that you could jump straight in and the audience will get it. what a waste","

"kunalkhandwala","12 May 2011","The Norse God's arrival on Earth was imminent from the appearance of his hammer, Mjolnir at the end of 'IronMan 2' and director Kenneth Branagh presents The God of Thunder upon our humble planet while making it entertaining with fantastic scenes of the realm of Asgard and quirky moments of Thor adapting to life on Earth. But those who know of the arrogant, powerful and reckless son of Odin, the expectations of thunderous action would be greater than the might of the hammer as depicted in the movie. On the day of Thor's crowning as King, some frost giants mysteriously break into the secret chambers of Odin and upon such discovery, Thor ventures into their realm of Jotunheim to respond to their threat. Along with his friends, Thor wages a reckless war with the Jotuns, with Mjolnir swinging wildly at any adversary and Thor flying brutally through a monster's mouth; but it is Odin's wisdom that saves them at a crucial juncture. Annoyed with Thor's rash behaviour and to teach him a lesson, Odin sends him to Earth without his powers and it is on this humble planet, that Thor, in his powerless state, learns to respect life and calms down as an almighty. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who crashes into the fallen Thor in the middle of a stormy desert, cools his temperament and serves as Earth's cheesy interest for him. His foster brother, Loki, meanwhile, plans to usurp the throne of Asgard while Odin is lost in his sleep and unleash the frost giants upon the beautiful realm. It's up to the mighty Thor to re-gain his powers and return to Asgard to re-establish order and destroy its threats.Undeniably, Thor is an exciting adventure. From the spectacularly depicted realm of Asgard, to the brutal battle with the frost giants and through the funny moments of Thor's introduction to our planet, there is entertainment galore and with Chris Hemsworth's cheeky Norse-like persona, Thor is all the more enjoyable. However, there is one major element that disappoints. This is a movie about Thor - The God of Thunder. The almighty one who has fallen from Asgard into the correctional facility that is Earth. His nemesis include frost giants and the destroyer that is sent to Earth by the evil works of Loki but apart from their brief confrontations, there is a certain dearth of the mind- blowing action that we would expect. The Mjolnir is hardly put into use after the initial battle and thunder is never used upon Thor's commanding. While the anticipation for the climax grew, the realization that there wasn't any action to be enjoyed, was the film's most disappointing aspect. It just did not end on a high that would be worthy of a thunder God. Instead, Branagh's approach seemed to center around portraying Thor as the reckless hero who couldn't control his mighty powers with a short fuse. Hemsworth enacts that aspect brilliantly with a boyish charm. Branagh also takes the liberty to throw in some cheesy romance between Thor and Jane which just doesn't suit the Norse character. Natalie Portman blushes her way through awkward moments and the excitable ones. Hemsworth too, seems lost in those romantic escapades since even he cannot relate to the Thunder God indulging in the cheesiness. Anthony Hopkins, in his brief role as Odin blends rather well and so does Tom Hiddleston as Loki, the insecure and mischievous foster brother of Thor. It does seem impossible to overlook the inspiration for the battle sequence with the frost giants ('The Lord of The Rings'), the depiction of spectacular Asgard (Rivendell) and Odin's palace (Minas Tirith) but the result however, is simply astounding.Thor could've been a bigger, more thunderous epic but from a director with a Shakespearean background; this works. For what it's worth, Thor entertains in a wholesome manner with all the gorgeous effects, action and a superhero's helpless struggle being on Earth. Thundering into the summer box-office, Thor sets things up for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s 'Avengers Initiative' that is due next year and as the disclaimer in all superhero movies goes, ""wait till the end of credits."" 8.199 on a scale of 1-10.","

"thinker1691","12 February 2012","From the creative mind of Stan Lee who makes his usual Cameo appearance, there arises yet another of his comic book heroes, "" Thor "" the God of Thunder. In this segment, narrated by and starring Anthony Hopkins as Odin, we have the young God Thor ( Chris Hemsworth) learning that being fearless, strong and courageous is not all that is required of the next King of the mystical kingdom of Asgard. Instead he disobeys his father and institutes a new war with the Frost Giants. For this he is banished to Earth to learn some humility and restraint. There he meets Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard, who we last seen in 'Red October'), his wife and Jane Foster. (Natalie Portman) While Thor is gone, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) his half brother usurps the throne and hopes to make Thor's banishment permanent. The entire film, (except for some rather cheesy characters who accompany Thor) is directed (rather well by the way) by Kenneth Branagh, is one incredible and fantastic visit to the Land of Odin. The sets, Costumes and the confrontations with the Frost Giants is nothing short of spectacular and worthy of Stan Lee Himself. Well worth a visit to the Theater and easily recommended. ****","

"dee.reid","21 May 2012","If you've seen the popular 1987 comedy ""Adventures in Babysitting,"" then you don't need to know what the title of that comment means. But I'm going to tell you anyway: I have to give the little girl in that movie some credit because she's got some original tastes - rather than idolizing something obvious like Batman or Spider-Man or Superman, she chose the lesser-known Marvel Comics superhero Thor.Thor, or The Mighty Thor, is not one of my favorite superheroes. While I consider myself a Marvel Comics reader more than any other comic book publisher - readers familiar of my reviews will note that I'm an avid Spider-Man fan - Thor is nonetheless an interesting Marvel Comics character to me because he's so different from other comic book superheroes, for one simple fact: he's a god. And not just any god, he's the God of Thunder in Norse mythology - re-interpreted as a comic book superhero. His comic book equals could possibly be Superman (of DC Comics, Marvel Comics' chief rival) or even the Silver Surfer (another popular Marvel Comics superhero) - although astute comic book readers will note that Superman and the Silver Surfer are actually aliens, not gods, but are still quite just as powerful (it'll be interesting to see a fight between the three, though).Stan Lee, his brother Larry Lieber and the legendary, late, great Jack Kirby were the trio of well-known Marvel Comics personalities who brought Thor to life in 1962, debuting in the issue ""Journey into Mystery #83."" 49 years later, that British thespian/director Kenneth Branagh brought The Mighty Thor to life in his own movie, ""Thor,"" to add the mighty Norse god to the current crop of special effects-laden superhero movies.For the most part, Branagh succeeds. Marvel's superheroes were always noteworthy for being outsiders, freaks and misfits, so where does The Mighty Thor - a god, remember - fit into that mold? Well, the movie does a good job of representing his origins: the mighty God of Thunder (played by Australian newbie Chris Hemsworth), is exiled from his home-world of Asgard to planet Earth by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), in the hopes that his son will learn a lesson in humility. (I'll just go ahead and say that Stan Lee chose his character's flaws rather well: he's one of the first superheroes whose personal dilemma is to learn a lesson and not just any lesson, but a lesson in power and responsibility.) It goes without saying that Thor is arrogant and reckless, nearly bringing Asgard to war with the neighboring realm of the Frost Giants, Jutenheim.Arriving on Earth stripped of his powers, he must now learn what it truly takes to be a hero and to be responsible for his actions. He's discovered by a trio of scientists in the New Mexico desert - Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, hot off her Oscar-win for ""Black Swan""), Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) - and they befriend him. It is through his encounters with them that Thor develops a deep fondness and admiration for the human race (in particularly Jane, his would-be love interest) and once he regains his powers - granted to him mostly by the mighty hammer Mjornir - he must eventually combat his traitorous adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who seeks the throne of Asgard for himself.I'll say that ""Thor,"" like most blockbuster superhero movies of late, is a breathtaking wall-to-wall action flick. If anything else, this movie also got me interested in learning more about Thor and the world he lives in. Although the movie starts off rather slowly and alternates a lot between Earth and Asgard (thereby creating an unwelcome case of vertigo at times), it keeps your attention throughout. While also not too deep or intelligent as it could be (as it should be), Chris Hemsworth proves to be a capable God of Thunder. Stripped of his abilities and forced to learn that ages-old Marvel adage (""With great power, there must also come great responsibility"") - and also making an unusually quick adjustment to life on Earth (one of the film's key weaknesses, I feel) - only then can he once again become The Mighty Thor!Newly-minted Oscar-winner Natalie Portman is serviceable as Jane Foster (she did go to Harvard, after all), but I do feel that she is somewhat under-used, as is Stellan Skarsgard, whose Eric Selvig is also quite familiar with the legends of the classic Thor from his childhood. Thor's close friends and fellow Asgardians - his homeboys Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Joshua Dalls), and home-girl Sif (Jaimie Alexander) - also provide Thor with some much-needed back-up on Earth when Loki's forces threaten our planet. And speaking of Loki, I believe that it is Tom Hiddleston who delivers the film's most complex and emotional performance as the son desperate to earn his father's love and respect, even if he has to wipe out all life on two worlds to make it so. So in that regard, he seems like such a worthy opponent to Thor.I enjoyed ""Thor"" for what it was, a worthy summer blockbuster comic book superhero adaptation. Even if it wasn't as deep or as involving as it could have been, it does serve as a build-up, yet another piece of the puzzle that will eventually lead to 2012's all-out superhero-fest ""The Avengers.""8/10","

"jfgibson73","26 May 2013","One of my favorite comic book characters, I never expected anyone to make a movie about Thor that was any good. Casting Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston made all the difference. Seeing the trailers, I didn't think they really looked the part. Chris especially seems small compared to what I would envision. But both are extremely enjoyable to watch as Thor and Loki, and I liked a lot of the other Asgardians as well. The frost giants looked great, the rainbow bridge was cool, and the fight with the Destroyer was fun. On top of that, the three scientists that find Thor are all good characters. I like the arc they set up for Thor in this movie. It came as a surprise after reading comics for so many years where Thor was already noble and mature. Making him start out as a short-sighted brat was a good idea. He has to earn the right to be the son of Odin again by be willing to sacrifice himself to save earth. When we see him in the Avengers movie and he talks about how he enjoyed battle when he was younger, it gives the character even more resonance. I am looking forward to part two, because this movie and the Avengers were a lot of fun.","

"dragokin","2 May 2013","Thor was the last in a series of comic books brought to screen i've seen within a relatively short time frame. It turned out to be among the best of them and the reason might be Kenneth Branagh directing it. Not that the movie breaks the mold of the genre, it just has a good atmosphere when dealing with the inhabitants of Asgard and supernatural creatures they're fighting.However, Kenneth Branagh didn't have a particularly demanding task. When depicting Asgard and the realms of the other side, he heavily relied on his Shakespearean background. The scenes on this Earth are a mixture of thriller and action movies. And as every such movie Thor needs a large fight, similar to the end of a level in any video game, if you know what i mean. Thus, Thor confronts a large monster as seen in numerous Japanese monster movies or even in Beastie Boys' video for Intergalactic.The cast deliver a solid performance, with Chris Hemsworth being a prefect choice for arrogant and blunt Thor. I'm curious whether he'll be typecast for the rest of his career.All in all, this movie is fun, but don't expect more than that from it.","

"sangomiguel","15 April 2021","Ok bare with me on this one.I'm starting to think that this film is way to underated and here's why.Disney already had this planned like since years ago and I mean the whole Marvel Phases, I think that the reason why Thor looks like he has almost no eyebrows it's because it was their intention to make him look younger, and I guess it does have an effect latter on.Number 2.I want to take a minute to really appreciate what marvel has done with their movies, every single actor was hand picked, these guys are profesional actors all the way through, Robert Downey Jr. , Scarlet Johanson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth. This last one Thor does a wild job in this film he is out of this world super good, I think Loki wasn't up for it at the time playing this character, and maybe there where a few cast members that had their doubts about the film but Chris Hemsworth tackles on this roll like his life depends on it.He is the only Asgardian that actually feels like he already made a Billion dollars and 4 sequels playing Thor he kills the rollThe other Asgardians are not so believable and sadly drag the movie down a bit as well as Tom Hiddleston's Loki, but there are enough cast members that really believe in their roll like Darcy (Kat Dennings), Natalie Portman (who also kills this roll), Anthony Hopkins; You know, guys that don't mess around with their job are able to bring the movie down to earth...Now here's the reason why I think that this movie is a jewel and it's my personal opinion and interpretation, my first spoiler review.Odin has to choose an heir and he has made up his mind it's Thor. On the very same day Thor was supposed to be crowned Loki helps two ice giants bridge into asgard interrupting the ceremony knowing that Thor hot headed as he is would take revenge which he does killing hundreds in the process, so his father banishes him as Loki planned. (Show's how smart is Loki and how many layers he has)Here is where my crazy theory begins: Odin is omnipresent. I think he can see everything that happens and that will happen.So when Loki confronts him about his past after Thor has been banished and turned into a human he decides to ""die"" and test his son, he literally gives him the Throne of Asgard, proving that he trusts in Loki.Loki's intentions are good his heart is with Asgard through all the movie and he even ""saves his father"" killing the leader of the ice giants in the process, but Odin despites the way he treats the other worlds and the genocide Loki provoked.Ok back to Thor, our main.Now, Thor has no powers no nothing he is a human, he has to learn how it is to be humble and a normal person and he is also tested by Odin this way, he gets the chance to proof that he can wear the power of a God humbly and by befriending the professor Jane and Darcy he proves he is a caring and humble person.Thor is ambitious he always has a purpose he wants to get back to Asgard and he finds his ways! He goes to every extent! And if I have learned something living 25 years is that opportunities present themselves only when you look for them and Thor seeks that, he seeks his power back via his hammer which he finds and later realizes he cannot lift.But in the process unknowingly he proves why he is Thor one understands why ""God"" would choose him to be a hero because he is brave, restless and a good friend, but not quite God worthy yet.At the end he sacrifices himself for his friends making the greatest act of love and braveness finally breaking the course and showing that he is in fact worthy of wielding all his powers. Because he fights for the greater good he is ambitious, he has goals, his mind allows him to want all this things and the universe always provides, he proves that it doesn't matter if he is a mortal or not he will stand against the biggest fighters, go to the greatest lengths to get what he wants and that's why he is Thor de god of thunder, because a hero rests in his heart and I just think that's beautiful.You can be a hero!","

"toqtaqiya2","23 December 2012","Thor was one of two films by Marvel Studios released during the summer of 2011, the other being Captain America: The First Avenger. Both Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) appeared in The Avengers (2012), a film that I initially didn't like much but after some time have grown to appreciate. The Avengers is a superb superhero film, one of the best of all time in fact. In Thor the best performance is by Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Tom again played Loki as the main villain in The Avengers. Loki is clearly up to no good but Hiddleston managed to show that he's a complex sympathetic character. Hemsworth was a good choice to play Thor, the crown prince of Asgard. With his dirty blond hair and ridiculously chiseled physique Hemsworth has plenty of charisma as Thor. The humor is frequent here and so is the action. The CGI was put to good use, and the realization of Asgard and the Bifrost is especially impressive. Still, the center of the film is the relation between Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his two sons. Director Kenneth Branagh was a good choice to tell this drama reminiscent of a play by William Shakespeare. Hopkins is a commanding presence as Odin, so his is another standout performance. But really, all the actors deliver here. There's Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three, there's Heimdall (Idris Elba), and there's Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The love story is a bit rushed since Thor and Jane fall in love by the fire with a starry night sky behind them. The pacing too isn't perfect but Thor is a thrilling film which can improve just about anyone's mood. Patrick Doyle delivered a good score, and the Foo Fighters song Walk was also included in the film. In conclusion, there's much to like in Thor and I highly recommend seeing it.","

"IronBallsM","8 May 2011","This spectacular film works on so many levels but in large part because of the great cast and the fact that the director took this subject matter seriously. Casting an unknown like Chris Hemsworth was perfect. Veterans like Anthony Hopkins really shine in their roles. What can you say about the stunningly beautiful Natalie Portman? She's just fabulous and is actually better here than in her Oscar winning role from Black Swan. It's written well and the special effects truly are Oscar worthy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.If you are concerned that this film may not live up to the hype, don't be. Also, don't believe the naysayers at all. I'm betting they are ALL DC/Green Lantern fans afraid their film is going to get lost in this crowded summer. Thor being exceptional gives them pause and actually something to worry about. Do yourself a huge favor and ignore them and see this wonderful film.","

"aballyTKD","8 May 2011","Directed by the one time great hope of British film and theatre and involving a pretty high-end cast of talent this film was visually pleasant enough. The lead was certainly easy on the eye to watch as the humbled warrior learning diplomacy, love, discretion, and all the other touchy-feely nonsense essential to the 21st century metro-sexual male-cum-mature Norse god.The scale of the CGI environments and settings was truly Wagnerian in nature and the film had a couple of reasonably funny slap-stick moments of comedy for light relief.The film is however pedestrian and plodding for the most part - my children (11 and 13) were both squirming in their seats for considerable portions of the movie. The main battle on a New Mexico (?) street seemed to be what the movie was leading up to - it was over in a trice, though the big tin man was impressive in a Gort-kind of way.A pleasant enough way to spend a rainy afternoon, but definitely not worth the money to see on the big screen.","

"Spondonman","12 July 2014","The closest I've ever got to Odin & Thor is through The Vikings; this was slightly different fare to that classic. I didn't expect much from this but got lots which surprised me â€“ it's the usual Marvel superhero cgi cartoon movie, but taken at a cracking pace, shaved of gristle and utterly daft. Quite good in fact, although I was warned by a few friendly movie experts it was naff â€“ however I always bear in mind none of those particular experts have ever seen or intend to see Citizen Kane.Hammer wielding impetuous youth Thor is thrown out of celestial Asgard by his all powerful father Odin, crashing to Earth, while his brother Loki machinates for overall control by apparently siding with the grunting red-eyed baddies from the Dark Side. Time is saved not only by accepting the universality of the English language but that standard plot devices involving falling in love, straightforward fight scenes, and metaphorical battles between Good and Evil are implicitly consented to as well. So many things are simply assumed that it gets a bit confused at times, and any characterisation is completely jettisoned as not worth the time â€“ and in kids movies like this it isn't worth the time. The cartoonery is swift and relentless but atmospheric and not as senseless as other similar efforts, such as Man Of Steel for example. The contrast between the serious ethereal world and the flippant real world is cleverly handled, almost impressive and reminded me of The Fountain in its doom-laden commentary. Different story strands all come together satisfactorily, whilst Thor or is it Brad Pitt lopes about suitably heroically. A nice one excellent in its inconsequentiality and well worth watching â€“ Gary Son Of Jan has so decreed.","

"kosmasp","26 December 2011","While I was as surprised as any Branagh fan, when I heard he would helm a comic book movie, I have to admit, he kept it light and amusing, while still holding onto the threats and delivering a fun character introduction. :o) Now I can understand, that some people might not like the way this movie is done or are fed up with comic book movies in general. What you cannot say about this movie though, is that it doesn't have a decent enough character or story development. It is clichÃ©, of course, but that does not make it any less decent now does it? It might make it boring for you, of course.Acting-wise, no one is taking him- or herself too serious. Which is a good thing. I liked everyone in this and didn't feel like the jokes were forced. Of course you could argue about political correctness (Thors ""friends""), but that would be nit-picking, now wouldn't it? So if you can enjoy a nice fun little ride of a movie, than I can recommend this to you","

"djmeredith","22 April 2011","This ambitious take on Norse mythology opens (well almost) with sweeping views of a colossal imagining of the other world inhabited by Thor, his father, and a plucky band of his axe-wielding, spear throwing war buddies. Thor is destined to become the new King of Asgard, since his dad is looking to settle down maybe on a beach house overlooking one of those awesome waterfalls.. It's pretty amazing stuff visually and the 3D really works wonders except for the perennial difficulty with darkened scenes, it's hard to make out the detail. But as far as 3D movies go, it was engrossing, not as special as Avatar but miles in front of Clash of the Titans.I don't think anyone would say Chris Hemsworth did anything but impress. He completely stepped up to the plate by bringing an interpretation of a 'Norse God' as intoxicated and thrilled by his own power, and he really seems to be loving every minute of it (maybe it's just in anticipation of getting to make out with Natalie Portman). He shows plenty of energy and this is used to great comic effect in the 'earth' scenes where his unconquerable spirit having to come to terms with a conquerable body lend to some hilarious moments.The writing towards the end brought down what would otherwise have been a satisfying movie with top acting and cinematography. What should have provided an emotional payoff with the most pivotal moment in the main character arc was instead the point at which the story resigned to connecting the dots. I found myself remembering instead a familiar moment in Disney's Hercules, where the same heroism was shown far more intelligently, even though viewer could see it coming. Whereas the audience were thoroughly entertained by the first half of the movie the laughter became a little more obligatory as it neared the end. I thought the premise had enormous potential, especially with involvement of S.H.I.E.L.D as a new breed of government agents. The casual throwback to the Iron Man franchise was brilliantly done. Can't a visually spectacular, first rate big budget movie surprise as well as entertain? But entertaining it is, just don't expect to go anywhere you haven't been before.","

"classicsoncall","4 November 2012","I always preface my Marvel movie reviews by stating I never followed the comics in favor of the DC Universe. If I picked up the occasional Spider-Man or Hulk, it would have been for lack of preferred reading material, and Thor was never on my radar as a must read character. But with the prominence of the Marvel movie universe, I knew I couldn't pass this one up forever. So even though I didn't splurge during the opening fanfare, I finally got around to it today on DVD.Altogether not bad. I probably enjoyed the opening half hour the most as the story took in Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) origin and place among the Greek god pantheon. I think the coolest character was that devil styled Laufey (Colm Feore) who oozed sinister menace without even trying. And Lord knows, Natalie Portman has to be one of the luckiest actresses on Earth, Asgard and Naboo to find herself in the most profitable and popular movie franchises going.That's not to say this film couldn't have used a little more character development, but after all, we're talking decades of comic book history distilled down to a two hour film so not everything is going to make the cut. ""Iron Man"" probably did it best so far, but this film brought an interesting cosmic dimension to the story that we haven't seen before. For his first super-hero outing, Hemsworth did a creditable job with a physique that admirably suited his character. Somehow I didn't think the character of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) was evil enough, but then I go back to my comment about King Laufey. Love those red eyes.The best single scene for me, and I look for him in every Marvel flick - Stan Lee marks his presence as the truck driver attempting to dislodge Mjolnir from the New Mexican desert and loses the flatbed! That's a big enuff 'Nuff said' for any Marvel fan.","

"rmillerlaw","23 May 2011","On the one hand, I generally support super hero movies. But how, in the early 1960s, a Nordic God became a modern super hero, baffles me. How Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgard got to be in a movie that seems above their level is beyond me also. And yet, this film wasn't without entertainment. The plot twist, if you will, involving the dynamics of Thor's family, was well done without being over dramatic. The explanation for how Thor gets to Earth is not something you'll want to think about too much, but it works. The helmets, which look like they were designed for the Royal Wedding by Lady Gaga, were something to look at. What worked best, for me, was the dynamic between Natalie Portman's character, Jane Foster, and her assistant, Darcy Lewis, who says at one point ""I'm not dying for six college credits."" Great and witty repartee between these two apparent friends. Whether intentional or not, the actions of Thor once on Earth were laughter inducing as well.The special effects were solid, although I'm not sure that 3D really brings anything to the table here. Some of the acting, or at least the dialog, is horribly bad here. I didn't leave the theater waiting and wishing for a ""Thor 2"".","

"jboothmillard","1 May 2012","From director Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Hamlet), I saw a trailer and some clips of this film, but I didn't realise until a little later that the story was based on Marvel comics, so that made me keen to see it. Basically in the outer space past world of Asgard, King Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) once waged a war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their King Laufey (Colm Feore) who want to take over the nine realms, starting with Earth, and now his son Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is due to ascend to the throne. This ascending is interrupted when the frost giants attempt to steal the power source known as the Casket of Ancient Winters, and Thor with his arrogance takes his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), childhood friend Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three: Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Joshua Dallas) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) to retrieve it. The battle that ensues causes the end of the truce between the two sides of the war, and Odin punishes Thor by taking his power and banishing him from the kingdom to be mortal on Earth, also sending his power source, the hammer Mjolnir, to be found by the worthy warrior. Landing in the deserts of Mexico he is found by astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd), while the hammer is found by local people, and soon surrounded by officials from S.H.I.E.L.D., with Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) in charge. Thor tries to retrieve Mjolnir, but he is unable to lift it from the ground, and he is captured by the agents, but Selvig helps him escape, and seemingly unable to gain his power back he focuses on a romance with Jane. Back in Asgard, Loki has discovered that he is not the real son of Odin, he was abandoned by the snow giants and taken at the end of the original war, so for revenge he forces Odin into a coma, becomes the new king, and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket, but the Warriors Three and Sif know of this plan. So they convince gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) to travel to Earth and find Thor, while Loki sends a Destroyer to find and kill his adversary, and after a battle Thor sacrifices himself to save everyone, and this act earns him his hammer and power to return. With his powers restored he defeats the Destroyer, he says a sad goodbye to Jane and the others, he returns to Asgard to confront Loki, who has betrayed and killed Laufey, and he destroys the bridge that allows them to go to Earth, and Loki falls into the abyss below, and he gives up Odin making him king. Also starring Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, Rene Russo as Frigga, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Stan Lee as Stan the Man and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. Hemsworth proves himself a worthy leading actor as the strong willed and heroic warrior, Portman is sweet as the hero's love interest, Hiddleston does a good job as the nasty villain, and Hopkins in his time brings his usual great seriousness, and director Branagh actually proves a director with good pace and vision. The story is an easy one to follow, and it obviously builds up to Avengers Assemble, just like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk did, the special effects are fantastic, and there are some great moments of action to catch your eye, an enjoyable fantasy adventure. Good!","

"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","13 December 2011","I'm a big comicbook movie fan and a moderate comicbook fan. I've never really been too familiar with the character of Thor, other than his appearance in an Incredible Hulk TV movie. I knew he was arrogant, confused, and a great warrior. I've also seen him in a few animated movies too. Like many fans, I await the arrival of The Avengers, but at the same time I hoped this wouldn't turn into a suppressive prequel like Iron Man 2. This was one of the most enjoyable film experiences in quite some time. It nailed everything that a summer blockbuster adventure movie should have. Action, comedy, romance (even if a tad forced), and great set pieces and supporting characters. Hemsworth plays Thor, as an arrogant tool. He thinks he knows it all, and can do it all. After being banished from his realm, a beautifully constructed Asgard that mixes CGI with more traditional set design, he arrives on earth with no powers. While his mischievous brother assumes control of Asgard.Thor, as a movie, has a lot to do. It has to kick start its own franchise, follow into The Avengers, all the while, mixing the world of Gods and magic, with our human world. It was never going to be an easy task so Branagh was the perfect choice. With his time in Shakespeare, he can do the classical, the drama, the tragedy, and the comedy. All of which is present and has plenty of space to breathe. The humour is difficult to get right, as this is Fish-out-of-water stuff. It's easy to make Thor seem stupid, but Branagh and the writers make him a traveller of worlds. He expects earth to be different, and knows he must at least try and fit in. By the time Thor's friends arrive in a Masters of the Universe fashion, it's clear this film has its tongue in cheek. On the acting front we get a great bunch. Hemsworth is everything he needs to be and more. His emotional screaming is just as satisfactory as his charm and humour. Hiddleston is the breakout star here. He plays Loki with many layers of complexity, which gradually evolves his frustrated pranks into more devilish acts. Portman is a love interest, and a smart one at that, at least she is able to help the hero in some way. Hopkins is his grand self, and Dennings is a nice if unnecessary addition, which gives her comedic duties allowing Portman and others to focus on the story. The action sequences are very well handled, although Thor's flying is usually kept at a distance. They never seem too long or too short (looking at you Iron Man 2). This is a great blockbuster and does what it should. Gets me interested in the character, in the franchise, and excited for The Avengers.",NA
"cinistersynthicate","5 July 2022","This film certainly holds up better than most of the MCU catalogue visually. I was genuinely surprised. Branagh captures the pure essence of the Thor comics and makes Asgard to be the most beautiful it has ever looked throughout the MCU. With that, he definitely brings more practical effects, dutch angles, and Shakespeare-esque dialogue to make this first installment feel real but add a bit of a director's touch to it, while still respecting the source material.",NA
"Al_The_Strange","8 May 2011","Remember the post-credit scenes in ""Iron Man 2,"" where the Shield agents discover a mysterious hammer-like object in the desert? Well, they finally made a movie all around that concept. ""Thor"" throws us into a world where Norse myth collides with the science-fiction Marvel universe in a surprisingly sublime fashion. With this clever setup, we are introduced to the title character, who battles giants and mortal men alike with thunderous force. There is plenty of action throughout this flick, and lots of beautiful special effects. Even when Thor isn't bashing the hell out of things, there's enough character-driven drama to keep it strong. And of course, nothing's more amusing than watching an archaic deity walking among modern man; there are a few funny moments throughout. It's maybe not as action-packed as some of the other Marvel films, but ""Thor"" met my expectations perfectly.The story's a little predictable, especially if you're already familiar with the comics or Norse myth. But it is well-presented, and presents enough decent characterization to keep it fresh. I do believe that something is missing; Thor never seems to learn much when he's on Earth. But he does learn something, and when the climax comes it makes good enough sense.The film has good photography for the most part. The frost-giant battle shows some rather jittery cameramanship and editing, but afterwards it's all solid. Some shots have some really funky crooked angles, but I think it's cool. Acting is great; I loved Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman in their roles, and Anthony Hopkins is a naturally good choice for Odin. Writing is not terribly sophisticated, but it gets the job done. Production value is phenomenal, with loads of excellent sets, props, costumes, and some very imaginative settings. It's especially impressive how the designers have adopted Norse myth into the story and designs to fit into a sci-fi niche, and still make sense. The music score is not bad.Recommended! 4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)",NA
"alexanderdavies-99382","2 July 2017","I was quite surprised at how effective this ""Marvel Comics"" superhero move is. ""Thor"" works because it keep the plot quite simple and therefore, avoiding any unnecessary subplots. The story goes something like this: The Mighty Thor is banished from his own world by his viking father (Anthony Hopkins) and is sent to the modern day world. Upon Thor's arrival, his trademark hammer has been embedded into the ground and no one but Thor can retrieve it. Thor befriends a group of archeologists who have been excavating in the same area where the hammer lays. There is a strong feeling of vulnerability about Thor. For all his bravery and fighting skills, he is rather overwhelmed and bemused by his surroundings. The man cast as the superhero is OK but no actor. Anthony Hopkins does well as Thor's father Odin. The rest of the cast are tolerable. I enjoy this film more than I thought I would.",NA
"komanca","7 September 2011","To paraphrase wisdom from Talmud: 'Without the ability to forget, man would live in a permanent, paralyzing fear of death.'I am grateful human being can forget. If not, I would have paralyzing fear of watching another movie, ever again, scared that it might be as bad as this one. Which is probably impossible, but anyway...I am an optimist here...or pessimist, not sure...If I wasn't clear enough: the movie is bad. If you want to watch super hero movie with (as Thor now has) 7.3 stars, go watch Bolt. Bolt will make you smile, at least.IMDb wants the reviews to be 10 lines at least, so I must write some more. Here it comes:Actors: 1) Thor guy was actually pretty good. I was surprised to see him decently convincing in different moods, but the script didn't give him a chance. 2) Natalie Portman - I mean, I love her, really I do, but this was ridiculous. 3) Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd â€“ I liked him. Not sure anymore. 4) Sir Anthony â€“ he is a great guy, really. In this movie? WellÂ…To be fair to the actors, screenplay was catastrophic. I guess no one could survive this one. Kenneth Branagh was the director. I stopped liking that guy after he broke up with Emma Thompson. This movie was just a confirmation that I wasn't wrong.Good luck and don't watch this. Go ride a bicycle. Or rent some good movie.",NA
"george.schmidt","18 May 2011","THOR (2011) *** Chris Helmsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Clark Gregg, Idris Elba, Colm Feore, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano, Josh Dallas, Jaimie Alexander, Rene Russo (Cameos:Samuel L. Jackson, Jeremy Renner). Marvel Comics' superhero origin flick about Odin's callow son Thor (Helmsworth, quite decent in a Heath Ledger charming way), who is banished from their Nordic universe to Earth â€“via wormhole â€“ as a mortal to prove himself rightful heir to the throne via redemption in saving mankind from his diabolical half-brother Loki (Hiddleston). A game cast, impeccable production design by Bo Welch and decent set pieces directed by unlikely helmsman Kenneth Branagh (or is it? Shakespearean undertones throughout suggest not!) makes more for the somewhat talky screenplay by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne & J. Michael Straczynski & Mark Protosevich (phew!) based on Stan Lee (yes there's a Lee cameo too!), Larry Lieber & the late great Jack Kirby's epic character leading to the inevitable AVENGERS film (next summer) with the ubiquitous Nick Fury cameo by Jackson and possible new Hawkeye Renner. One last note the 3D isn't too shabby either (watch that hammer throw!)",NA
"phd_travel","8 November 2011","There are two contrasting worlds. The celestial science fiction world of Thor, Anthony Hopkins and the immortals quite grandly shown with epic battles stunning backdrops and serious words. When this is all getting too heavy we move into New Mexico on planet Earth with the rather girlish Natalie Portman for comic relief. Somehow it doesn't quite succeed - it feels schizophrenic. There isn't much chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. He although a bit inexpressive facially does portray an other worldliness but she just seems silly. She wasn't a good choice. The dialog could have been better - it's rather heavy and obvious. Didn't really feel for any of the characters. The only humor comes from Thor being like a bull in a china shop on Earth. It's not very consistent. Overall missable.",NA
"staticstation1","5 April 2019","Thor I would say is not my personal go-to superhero. I knew of him. I'd seen the character in different forms of media and comic books, but he was never the standout for me. I was young when this film was upon release and I was very little aware of the film's existence or it's placement in the MCU. The moment I found out about the connection was in the Iron Man 2 post-credits scene. If you read my review for that, you'll see that I didn't exactly watch the film until it's home release. I wasn't aware that the post-credits were a trend at the time. After watching the first Thor trailer and then researching it, I came across the scene. Now again I didn't watch this film in cinemas. I watched it with a close friend, and we were both mildly impressed. And over the years I have seen and read many mixed reviews, but I still maintain that this is one of the better produced and made films in the MCU!
POSITIVES!
Now I understand the audience reactions that come from this film. Ones that think because the character isn't kicking ass throughout the film that it's boring. I don't think that at all. There is action. Not an insane amount, but enough to show you what the character can do. But this is a great character arc. One, I thought, so great that it made Thor my favourite Avenger for a time. This is something I love about the plot and writing. This is a character driven story with a character that rises above selfishness and arrogance. The writing overall has a very Shakespeare charm about it. A story about family, and, brotherhood. Tom Hiddleston portrays the antagonist in this film, and he is brilliant. You instantly understand his motive and the actor's approach to a ""villain"" and so well deserving of the praise the character and actor has received throughout the MCU. But this film is packed full of amazing talent. Whether they a good or not, the actors that are involved are all talented in their acting background. I must praise rich and unblemished cinematography. This is a beautiful film to look at. The visual effects are stunning as well as is the artwork behind them. It is a great blend of having these God-like characters in this comic book world. The costume and makeup departments have very immaculate work. Brilliant sound design, particularly with Thor's Might Hammer, Mjolnir. A pungent score, that I think is improved on, but it works for this film.
MIXED!
Chris Hemsworth stars in the title role. An actor that had only gotten a starring role on soap-operas in Australia. This was the big break for the actor, and he is okay. Obviously over the course of his own and The Avengers' franchises he has really delivered an entertaining character. But in this film, he is adequate. Now the director of this film Kenneth Branagh does a fine job. Some of his camerawork was a bit off, especially with the dutch-angles. But I feel as if his main intention in this film was to deliver a grand scale epic drama rather than a comic book film.NEGATIVES!
Natalie Portman is a fine actress. There is no doubting that. But the chemistry she has with Hemsworth feels very much like acting than natural. Portman feels miscast. Like I said before there is a lot of talent in this film, but some of that talent feels wasted. Particularly with Idris Elba. I keep forgetting that the actor is in the MCU. And the actor never really shows off his incredible range in any of the films he is showcased in. Now my biggest complaint would be, despite the filmmaking in this project, the film isn't as enjoyable as other entries in the superhero genre. The urge to rewatch this film isn't very potent. It is a great character arc and the audiences that criticize the film for not having as many action sequences do have just opinions.
CONCLUSION!
So, Thor I enjoy for its filmmaking troupes. I enjoy the character more than the performance. The antagonist, for sure, outshines the protagonist. It is a great expansion and departure for comic book films and the MCU. Delivers a brand-new character and one of the most powerful Avengers. It is a bit hit or miss for audiences and I understand that. But there is more to enjoy than dislike for me.",NA
"forerunnerfox","8 May 2011","My friends and I follow a lot of movies, we look at what's coming out and we're open to pretty much seeing anything with a good rating and use IMDb daily to check ratings. I wanted to see this but i did not have high hopes for it. I thought it'd be good and had a good cast but I thought it would have really cool visuals and effects with an okay story that wasn't too true to the comic. I saw this yesterday and let me say it was amazing, the whole movie was put together very well and the story line left you interested and even emotional at times. I looked up the rating while i was waiting for it to start and after I left the theater I could not stop talking about how good it was and how impressed I was (as well as having to rate it at at least a 9/10 when I get home). Also I recommend seeing it in 3D/Imax.P.S: There's a video after the credits, stay and watch it!",NA
"jeddjong","20 May 2011","The folks at Marvel Studios have good business sense, and have put a lot of effort into building a Marvel movie universe populated by popular Marvel Comics characters. Iron Man 2 closed with a secret teaser ending, showing the discovery of Thor's hammer Mjolnr, and introducing an important piece of the Marvel movie universe puzzle.Thor is a staggering achievement, filled with imaginative energy and crackling with excitement, but the greatest weapon this warrior wields is its strong plot. Director Branagh brings his Shakespearian senses to the fore, stirring elements such as the Cain-and-Abel tussle between Thor and Loki, the star-crossed romance between Thor and Jane and also the friction between Thor and his disapproving father Odin into the cinematic pot.Branagh proves that he is no pushover when it comes to action sequences and wide panoramic vistas either. He has a keen eye for what looks good to excitement-hungry moviegoers, and this movie is packed with fantastic and beautiful visuals. From the sparkling spires of Asgard to the desolate wasteland of Jotunheim, this is a ten-course feast for the eyes â€“ especially when given the 3D treatment.Chris Hemsworth proves himself as a charming and charismatic leading man. Thor is portrayed here as a skilled but reckless and headstrong warrior prince, and Hemsworth takes the audience along as Thor learns humility and finds love on Earth, even as he experiences some hilarious moments of culture shock. He also does well in the fight sequences, having trained and gained 20 pounds of pure muscle for the role.The supporting cast hits all the right notes as well, Anthony Hopkins imbuing Odin with thundering authority, Tom Hiddleston always possessing a malicious glint in his eye as Loki and Natalie Portman at her most normal and girlish as astrophysicist Jane Foster. Stellan Skarsgard grounds the film as Foster's level-headed mentor, and Kat Dennings is well-cast and very funny as the comic relief sidekick, usually a male role.An all-round movie-going experience, Thor is the explosive and substantial summer movie season opener everyone has been hoping for, and is unmissable on this and any other of the eight known realms. Oh, and don't forget to stay past the credits for a mind-blowing revelation.",NA

"Howlin Wolf","31 January 2012","I feel that the sequel to this movie is almost destined to flop, if a deal can't be agreed that sees Kenneth Branagh return to direct.... Initially I thought handing him the job was a mistake, but after judging on the merits of the entire film, I'm confident that I totally understand the choice... Both he and one of his stars (Anthony Hopkins) know how to sell bombastic speeches and make them inspirational rather than hyperbolic. Some people don't understand the intrinsic link between Shakespeare and comic-books (numerous academics have stated that if Shakespeare were alive today, then in their opinion he would be writing serials/soap operas... ) If they don't get someone in charge who knows how to grace age-old themes with a light touch, then Thor 2 could well sink like a stone... This is an epic in the truest sense of the word, just with CGI to fill in the story pockets that exist around the basic accomplishment of goals... If the technology had existed to create awe-inspiring sights using machinery, then it's not unreasonable to think that the storytellers of their time would have used them... Good old fashioned grand conflict never changes, though, and Branagh seems to have an instinctive understanding of this principle.",NA
"jeremyfredrikson","11 May 2011","Boy, was THOR average. Absolutely nothing on screen surprised me (other than a scene I apparently missed which I guess appears after the entire end credits). Basically, Thor is a hotheaded warrior who just smacks ice monster men with his hammer and/or tackles them and later humans who are guarding his hammer on Earth where it lands in a desert and becomes like Excalibur's sword where no one can pull it out. The actor who plays Thor looks great and is very likable, but the rest of the cast just walks through the paces. Natalie Portman's character could have been played by anyone, Anthony Hopkins seems bored and tired, and the cute Amanda Sefreid is completely wasted and adds absolutely nothing to the proceedings as Portman's pal. The story is: Thor's about to become King but the ceremony is interrupted by a few ice monster creatures who are Thor's people's sworn enemies. Thor and a few of his buddies attack that race's world without a plan which causes the King to banish Thor to Earth without powers as his hammer is stuck in a desert a la Excalibur. Meantime, Thor's brother takes over as King and (no) surprise turns out to be kind of a traitor. Boring. A giant Iron Man looking thing is sent to Earth by Thor's brother, Thor asks it to spare the Earthlings and kill him, which it apparently does with one smack to the face. Then Anthony Hopkins' sleeping king sheds a tear as he telepathically hears how kind Thor is now (he has transformed from hotheaded to understanding in no time) and frees Thor's hammer which flies into Thor's hand, waking him up and allowing him to beat the tar of of the Iron Man robot thing in seconds flat. His buddies came to visit him for a few seconds before this, couldn't fight the monster for squat, and then they all return home so Thor can beat up his brother. The end. Until the post credit scene nobody stayed for. Too bad. I really like the concept of Thor and Nordic legend type warriors/gods. This story was really simple and offered absolutely nothing new to filmdom. Where IRON MAN rocked in a half humorous/half serious super hero way, the Tim Burton BATMAN movies were visual masterpieces, the Toby MacGuire SPIDERMAN movies were fun and colorful comic books come to life, and the newer BATMAN movies were dark and serious, THOR doesn't really make much of its own mark (although lots of the CGI bridge scenes make the characters look like tiny sized ants instead of big warriors when they walk upon them if that's a visual distinction albeit not a very good one). Not enough humor, not enough pathos, and not enough action to make it stand out (the coolest and most memorable action moment comes when Thor uses his hammer to fly through a monster's mouth and comes out the back of its head; the other fighting is pretty uninspired and consists of a lot of punching, basic kicks, and tackling which is fine and fairly realistic but not anything that stands out as extraordinarily memorable). THOR misses the potential to cash in on both the fish out of water and the Men In Black/CIA being a hindrence story lines. Hope Thor's next movie tops this one which should be an easy task. It doesn't stink, but it's just nothing to hoot about. Oh, and see it in 2-D. The 3-D scenes are really few and far between. All they added to the experience was a foil greater than Thor's brother as they made it hard to see when walking down the stairs at the hour twenty mark on the way to the can after a 20 dollar movie drink.",NA
"eferhild2010","11 May 2011","This movie was not at all meant to to be 3D and it shows it. There is nothing in the movie that shows 3D was inspired at all. In fact there were times I noticed that I noticed it seems that 3D wasn't even converted. It was a waste of my money to spend watching this in 3D. The conversion of A Nightmare Before Christmas was worth more than this movie. Don't waste your money on this movie. And by the way don't steal my money by cheaply converting a movie. There are to many other movies that could benefit from this and I'm talking older movies. As for the movie itself was OK. I don't like watching something that could have and should have been better.

"wellthatswhatithinkanyway","18 October 2011","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Thor (Chris Hemworth), who in ancient Greek mythology was the God of Thunder, finds himself banished from his home planet by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) after disobeying him and nearly starting a war with the 'ice killers' (or something like that.) Anyway, he crash lands on earth, where he happens upon young researcher Jane (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) who are having their own problems with some local government bureaucrats, which makes him come in handy when he forms a friendship with them after they teach him about earth ways and customs. Meanwhile, back on his home planet, his jealous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assumes the throne when Odin dies, setting Thor on a course to return home and begin a battle to the death that will encompass both planets.Kenneth Branagh is a name that appears to have disappeared to the sidelines in the movie art form, with me last hearing of his name in his initial home of the theatre in some production he was doing there. Here, he appears to have done a bit of a Clint Eastwood and stayed out of view behind the camera, where he's graced this production with his particular style of pomp and grandiose directing. Within the medium of the comic book film, from the iconic Marvel chain line and borrowing from the ancient Greek mythical character, he is in his element, with all the right ingredients to make this the marvellous romp it could have been. Something just falls flat with Thor, though, never coming to life or working as the great fun it could have been.Even by comic book film standards, this is complete nonsense, not helped by a distinctly humourless streak and a camera man who can't seem to hold it at a straight angle at various important shots in the film. As the titular Thor, Hemsworth carries the role decently enough, with a dashing arrogance that the role requires, whilst Hopkins invests an energy and gusto into his role that doesn't really fit the material. None of the supporting cast, from Portman to Skarsgard, are bad, either, it's just this is one big, lumbering mess of a film, with a bone headed steak that is the biggest surprise of all from the refined Branagh. **",NA
"screenwriterchick","28 May 2011","Thor, a movie about a superhero who faces many of the challenges of Earth, is the best movie ever, in my opinion. Thor has all of the great elements of a superhero movie: evil villains, betrayal, romance, and the occasional splash of comedy, making it definitely the best movie that I have ever had the pleasure of watching.This movie's special effects were absolutely outstanding. The quality of the picture, as well, was certainly outstanding. The portrayals of the characters were all spot-on. Hemsworth's Thor, Portman's Jane and Hiddleston's Loki were all amazing portrayals, and I felt as if I could really connect to all of the characters on screen.I have now seen this movie four times, and every time I manage to find something different; a different shot of a character, a different joke that I didn't hear, a different look that one character gives another. I believe that every time that I see this movie, it gets better and better.Thor, by far, soared above my expectations. I was expecting a good movie, but not one this great. I can easily say that Thor is my favorite movie of all time, and I am so glad that this movie was so well-made, and so inspiring and fantastic.",NA

On the plus side,Thor has an interesting mythology, and it's nice to escape the trap of the wealthy bachelor/superhero protagonists we've seen so much of lately. Also, it's filled with good British actors (the Americans didn't do so well). But to be honest this movie had no soul. It was flat, boring, and not nearly as well executed as others in the genre. This is the kind of movie they release early because they know that if they put it out in the summer it would be crushed.",NA
"Robert_duder","23 August 2011","I've talked to a lot of people that saw Thor and many of them had the same thing to say. It was just okay...it was meh...it left no solid impression on your like other Marvel superheroes that became larger than life on the screen like Spiderman or X-Men. Thor had some stumbling blocks. I think first of all he's a tough hero to translate to the big screen. For that purpose they did okay. The scenery and special effects are truly outstanding. The scenes that are on Asgard and the frost giants world are stunning and something else to see. Although as always the 3D did nothing for me. It looked just as good in 2D. The issue is not the effects. The issue is the characters don't really go well together, and Thor, the God of Thunder spends nearly the entire film on earth and powerless. It isn't until the last half hour or less of the movie when he finally regains his powers and starts to kick butt. Up until then you're just watching an awkward enormous blonde man live amongst humans. The romance that blossoms in the film is forced and downright silly and the action scenes are done almost without Thor for a lot of the time.There is no doubt that Chris Hemsworth fits the build and look of Thor. In fact he isn't bad in the role. I felt like it was a little campy (nothing compared to the 1970's role of Thor on The Incredible Hulk TV Series) but he still doesn't come to life in front of you. Natalie Portman who is a huge superstar in Hollywood is almost wasted in this movie. She is supposed to be a brilliant scientist but looks like a deer in the headlights, picks up this over-sized brute of a man and then somehow falls in love with him in a few seconds. Portman looks pretty as always but that's about as far as it goes. The chemistry between them is weak. Tom Hiddleston is Loki, Thor's adopted brother and if you know even a little about the Thor storyline you know where his story is going. Hiddleston is good. He makes an interesting anti-hero/villain and while he's a little campy it will be interesting to see where he takes the character. The legendary Anthony Hopkins joins the cast which automatically brings up the ante of this cast but even Hopkins' character as Thor's father is a little empty to me. He is good but he isn't great and that's what you want from a big budget summer flick and Hopkins. Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd and Kat Dennings have supporting roles as Portman's co-workers and they are good but they don't get a chance to really stand out. Kat Dennings is the comic relief but her comedy is misplaced at times. Honorable mention to Colm Feore who plays King of the Frost Giants. He has a small but decent role.Thor was supposed to be of course another lead in to The Avengers film which I still think is a risky prospect but Marvel are trying their best. This was certainly the summer of Marvel but I think Thor was the weakest of their entries considering how amazing X-Men First Class was and Captain America was solid too. Thor almost felt like just a filler film that they had to do. Director Kenneth Branagh is a great director and an even better actor but I think he didn't have a lot to work with. They forced it out and didn't try to reach the quality that they often do with new properties like Iron Man. But for fans of Marvel flicks I suppose it will get watched and it is mildly entertaining but it won't stick with you long after the credits role. 7/10",NA
"invister123","5 September 2011","I started to watch the movie with a little less expectations, because of the earlier horrible movie called ""Almighty Thor"".In fact this movie turned out to be superb. The actors were average, except Tom and Natalie, because they're really good. We all knew the story, but it was worth watching again.The animation was good, considering the low budget of the movie. But I think the director sucked, because the script was amazing, and he lacked in creativity. I usually rate any movie with 10 stars, but I rate this one 9 only because I think that I could have directed the movie better if I had this amazing script and animators.Watching this movie was a good experience.",NA
"jonnyhavey","7 May 2011","Marvel's most recent Avenger's prequel is about one of the most interesting superheroes. Director Kenneth Branagh's (better known as an actor, Valkyrie) Thor bridges the gap between mythology and the comic book superhero genre with action and mystical CGI. The film could have done without the third dimension (3D) and it needed better script writing, but in the end Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek) successfully brings the god alive alongside big name actresses Natalie Portman (Black Swan) and Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist). The film begins where Iron Man 2 left off with a supernatural storm landing Thor in the middle of New Mexico. There, scientist Jane Foster (Portman), assistant Darcy Lewis (Dennings) and Doctor Erik Selvig (Stellen Skarsgard, Pirates of the Caribbean) accidentally hit him with their vehicle wondering where he came from. How did the all mighty Thor end up in the middle of New Mexico? Thor was on the brink of becoming king of his father Odin's (Anthony Hopkins, Silence of the Lambs) realm Asgard. However, after the Frost Giants from the realm of Jotunheim interrupt the ceremony, Thor leads his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) with a small group of companions to Jotunheim without his father's permission. An epic battle scene unfolds and as the Frost Giant's leader Laufey (Colm Feore, Changeling) fights Thor off, Odin intervenes and banishes Thor to earth for his disobedience stripping him of all his powers. Thor is forced to embark on a journey to regain his honor on earth as he falls for Jane Foster while evading the mysterious organization SHIELD whose intentions come with Furry.Thor is everything a summer superhero blockbuster should be: funny, visually spectacular, action packed and most importantly entertaining. The film is uniquely shot, moving between the mystical realm of Asgard and the Earthly world intertwining the two almost perfectly. Hemsworth, Portman, and Skarsgard were all worthy cast members mending the shoddy script they were given. Hemsworth was definitely big enough for his role, while Portman balances his might as his petite, fragile love interest, and Skarsgard's multidimensional mentor figure. These three still aren't the best part of the film because of a surprise cameo that may not be very obvious, but if you know what is happening you may freak out.The film's visuals are very impressive, however, the 3D is completely unnecessary. Everything seems blurred, dark and cramped because the 3D picture takes away from the beauty of each realm. While this may not be as noticeable to some viewers the script has evident dialogue mishaps creating an underwhelming cinematic opening to the film. Script problems are subdued as the film progresses as the magic of cinema takes hold, but the script may also be to blame for the insertion of Dennings's character in the film; a character without a purpose.Director Branagh does his part in bringing the latest of the Avengers to life in grandiose fashion by creating comic book mythology. The film is everything that the Clash of the Titans remake wishes it was with a side of earthly superhero magic.",NA
"Empifilmes","9 July 2022","What a character introduction! Through a generic but emotional story this film follows the journey of Thor. The classic, arrogant, egocentric and selfish hero who, removed from his powers, discovers the path of wisdom and compassion through love. A strong attribute of this film is the way in which from the start clarifies the mythological world that introduces, leaving no loose ends.The characters are well-crafted, Thor has a mature and emotional arc as well as a solid and beautiful relationship with Jane Foster. Jane, on the other hand, manages to be more than just the love interest, which is not usual in this genre of films. The villain is simple, ingenious and fits perfectly with the tone of the MovieAll in all, this Movie effectively introduces a character who will be an essential key to the future of the universe. All that it took was a carefully explained story and great character development.",NA
"exot_shrimp","31 January 2012","This movie was juvenile, poorly written, and idiotic. Written to appeal to the lowest common denominator of humor and action.Throughout the film you are treated to incredibly dry action sequences of ""punch this"" ""block this"" ""hammer that"", and duologue that begs oneself to roll your eyes at the punch lines and scoff at the mechanical delivery of conversation. You can literally watch Natalie Portman die on the inside as she realizes what a mistake she made to accept the role...THOUGH there was one funny line which SHONE above the rest of the movie: ""This mortal form grows weak. I require sustenance!"" I found it quite humorous, but then realized that the only reason I was laughing was because it caught me off guard since EVERYTHING ELSE was poorly delivered/written.-.- So bad... I love me some super hero movies, but this movie and Green lantern are nearly at the same level of tripe... (Green lantern was just... bad... but thor was just... bad and stupid. Maybe green lantern was a smidge better then? Doesn't say much though)",NA
"btwo-79362","17 March 2022","Yes, the Dutch angles are so distracting. Seriously, there are so many Dutch angle shots in this movie, and it's not necessary at all.Anyways, the movie is kinda boring. When Thor is in Asgard, the movie is fine. In fact, more than fine. The setting of Asgard is beautiful, with breathtaking shots and the designs of the people in this world.But once Thor is in the real world, it goes down hill. The desert is ugly, dull, and boring. The fish out of water sequences are enjoyable, but after that, nothing else.",NA
"jonathanruano","31 July 2011","Perhaps the best way to start this review is with an observation about a very talented actor's career. Natalie Portman demonstrated with her spellbinding performance as Nina in ""Black Swan"" that she can act really well, but then she went on to act in three terrible films, ""No Strings Attached,"" ""Your Highness"" and now ""Thor."" In ""Thor,"" Portman is simply miscast. She is not a warm actor meant to play in romantic films(that is more Amy Adams' vocation), but instead a cold and efficient actor who is more suited to roles where she is expected to play a villain or someone socially awkward (if not anti-social) or a gifted prodigy with inner demons. Yet director Kenneth Branaugh and the producers put her in this film where she is expected to play a romantic lead -- something that she never did very well throughout her two-decades long career. As a result, every romantic scene with Portman looks forced from the flirtation to the laughing to the kissing scene. She does all these scenes with professional efficiency, but that unfortunately is the problem. There is nothing professional or efficient about love. Love is this irrational, emotionally charged and fantastic thing. If anyone experiences love the same way Natalie Portman's Jane Foster character did, then perhaps they should reevaluate their relationship and find someone else.But that is not the only problem with ""Thor."" This movie fails at the screenplay stage. There are so many wall-to-wall special effects and blasting soundtracks (Hollywood frequently confuses loudness with good music) that there's no room for a plot or for character development. Moreover what little story line there is was taken out of dozens of movies which exhausted these plot gimmicks. Chris Hemsworth plays the ""Thor"" character in the same spirit as Dustin Claire played Gannicus in the second season of Spartacus, except that Claire's character evolved beyond the caricature of the muscular cool guy at the gym who is loved by all women. Hemsworth's Thor, by contrast, has not even lived up to the caricature, because the plot allows for no character development. Or take how Jane Foster (Portman) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) react to the appearance of the muscular Thor. Those scenes of women enamoured with Thor's manliness are essentially a page taken out of a less than memorable scene in Cecil B. Demille's ""The Ten Commandments,"" when muscular Moses (Charleton Heston) crosses the desert and happens upon a small farm with an elderly farmer and his daughters. The daughters are thrilled because they see a muscular, heroic man. In other words, ""Thor"" is really the product of wall to wall special effects and recycled story lines. The immediate impression I got was that the producers decided to go with the first draft of the screenplay rather than telling their writers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something better. The result is mind numbing entertainment.As a final comment, the villains in this picture are not compelling. The frosty giants do not do anything except turn other people into frost or get knocked down in record numbers. This, of course, is boring because we have known for more than ten years that computers can create fake armies battling each other. Moreover this film does not have the guts, the imagination and the intelligence to show how brutal and dehumanizing violence and war really are (even though there are two battles on screen). Instead the violence appears to come out of several mindless video games. Something mildly interesting was done with the villain Loki, who may not have seemed as bad as the other villains, but even then Loki's character was so limited and oversimplified that he just wasn't interesting. I was stunned to see IMDb.com awarding this terrible film 7.4/10. It goes to show how easy it is convince the viewing public that they're not watching junk. I think 3/10 is more suitable.",NA
