"2","A_Kind_Of_CineMagic","8 October 2020","Clone Wars starts out as seeming like a mostly pretty lightweight bit of family entertainment with touches of the more exciting and more serious aspects of Star Wars. However, it develops to be a hugely powerful and astoundingly high quality addition to the overall story.The animation gets better and better as it goes along and is absolutely stunning in later seasons.The storytelling manages to totally transcend an animated 'kids show'. It becomes WAY more than that. There are heart poundingly exciting episodes and heartbreakingly moving stories as well as deepening and strengthening of the whole saga by the clever and wonderful storytelling of this show.Yes there are quite a few fillers along the way which are chucked in as light relief but the serious and dark stories that grow throughout the 7 seasons are phenomenally strong and superb quality.This stands easily alongside the best movies as great Star Wars. The writing and voice acting are terrific while the action and animation is amazing.","

"3","johnrider-55139","12 February 2020","Here is a full analysis of the show season by season.Season 1:
Extremely underwhelming start for a show I've heard so much about. The animation is pretty good for a TV show, but that's about it. The episodes are very straightforward, have no real consequences, and more often than not seem to be like moral anecdotes for kids. Very disappointing.
Rating: 5.0/10Season 2:
Definitely some improvement but still a long way from anything ""good"". It is still standalone episodes, very repetitive, and apart from a little better world exploration, the show seems to be headed nowhere.
Rating: 6.5/10Season 3:
All of a sudden, the show entirely changes its tone. This is no longer a kids show, more like PG-13. The animation also improves greatly. From episode 1, we are given a much more compelling narrative. It's no longer standalone episodes, we now have story arcs. Longer arcs means more time to develop the story, added depth to characters, and much more in-depth world building. This show finally seems to be going somewhere.
Rating: 8.0/10Season 4:
This is where the show becomes just amazing. We feel The Revenge of The Sith gradually being set up. The stories are getting darker and grittier. What's best is the narrative is no longer black and white. We are shown the war from the perspectives of those we have so far only called ""villains"".
Rating: 9.0/10Season 5:
Another amazing season. Like I said, after season 4 the show reaches a very high standard and stays there. Although there are some boring arcs, the main story fully compensates for it. I will not go into too much detail, in fear of spoilers.
Rating: 9.5/10Season 6:
Slightly, only slightly, worse than season 5, which for me is the absolute peak of this show. It still has its fair share of good story arcs and sets up many events of Episode 3.
Rating: 9.0/10Season 7:
Season 7 has 3 story arcs, of which the first is pretty decent, and the second is catastrophic. However, the final arc of 4 episodes is something in itself. It is deserving of all the great reviews that it is receiving and more. By playing into episodes 3, it in a sense redeems the prequels, but I will not say much about it to avoid spoilers. Besides, Disney's graphics overhaul is simply amazing, and makes the show so much more fun to watch. A perfect season and show ending for me.
Rating: 10.0/10Thoughts:
An amazing show which I would recommend everyone to watch. However, if you have less time/patience, I'd suggest skipping the first 2 seasons, and soke arcs of the coming seasons (just check the episode ratings to know). This show is a great filler that takes place between the events of episode 2 and episode 3 of the prequel films. It adds so much more relevance to the events of episode 3. Viewers' biggest problem with episode 3 was how it felt rushed. Just watch Clone Wars and it will all seem to fit in place.Salient Features:
1. Humanising the Clones:
The films did little justice to the clones, who were treated quite like droids with the exception of Obi Wan and Anakin. This show shows their human side, their psychology during the war, and adds uniqueness to each clone.2. Ahsoka:
I will not say much to keep this review free of spoilers. All I can say is, Ahsoka's character development is at par with some of the best I've ever seen. It's a real pleasure seeing her grow from a unbalanced padawan to a well trained Jedi Commander.3. Dark side:
This show also portrays the war from the perspective of the siths, somewhat humanising them, and giving us more clarity as to their decisions.4. Bounty Hunting:
Even the bounty hunters aren't two dimensional characters who only care for their bounty. The show portrays bounty hunting as a respectable job, and displays the code of honour which exists between them.TL;DR:
The show is a solid 10/10 for me, and a worthy addition to the Star Wars Saga. A must watch for all Star Wars fans.","

"4","Vic_max","24 October 2008","I actually stumbled on this series by accident - and what a nice surprise! While I did not see the associated animated film (because of the very bad reviews), this show seems to have some very good things going for it.For a TV series, the visuals and sounds are really great. The colors, scenery and style of ""3D"" animation are really appealing. And the sounds (including character voices) are pretty well done too.Characters: It took me three episodes to get comfortable with the new look of the main characters. It was a bit awkward watching them at first, but now it's OK. One slight issue I still have is that they sometimes remind me of characters from a kid's show than a general audience show.But that's OK - it's really great to have 30 minutes of good quality Star Wars story-telling each week. The force is with this show!","

"5","kaden_lewis","5 January 2022","I decided to watch Star Wars for the first time in March if 2021. I wanted to watch it in timeline order, and watch all the cartoons as well. I am so happy I did. With the exception of Star Wars Resistance, they were great. But out of all the Star Wars I watched, I spent the most time with the clone wars. That is because it is so long, but it made me make a connection with the show, and some of the characters who aren't really in the movies. It is definitely my favorite animated show, and it is also one of my favorite shows all time.I loved so much about this show. I loved the characters, the writing, the animation, and the acting. Most of the characters in this show are characters from the prequel movies, with the exception of Ahsoka Tano. She made her debut in The Clone Wars movie as a young Padawan to Anakin. She developed over the span of 7 seasons, and 12 years to be some peoples favorite Star Wars character. She isn't my number 1 favorite, but she is definitely up there. She became so popular, she made a live action appearance in The Mandalorian season 2 episode 5, and is getting her own live action show that is a spin-off to The Mandalorian. Of course, characters like Anakin, Obi-Wan, and everyone else from the prequels were also amazing.I also have to give credit to the show runner, Dave Filoni. He had no experience with CGI animation coming into this show, and did amazing. Not only was the animation great, the writing of the episodes were amazing. The whole show involves the main characters doing crazy missions, and it all takes place in between ""Attack of the Clones,"" and ""Revenge of the Sith."" Until the final four episodes of this show that takes place during ""Revenge of the Sith."" A few seasons in, the writers started doing 'series of four.' It is four episodes in a row that are all one story. It is basically one long episode split into four. Some of the 'series of fours' were phenomenal. Especially the finales.Lastly, the acting in this show was amazing. This show used predominantly voice actors instead of their live action actors, and they were all perfect. Their tones and the way they spoke made it sound like the live action character. I have to give huge credit to the actors of Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Maul. Their performances in this show were phenomenal. Especially Maul. His voice acting in my opinion was better than it was in ""The Phantom Menace.""Like I said, this is my favorite animated show, and is one of my favorite shows all time. Everything from the acting to the way the characters developed together was just amazing. The ending of this show also couldn't have been written any better. I definitely recommend watching this show. I am extremely grateful that I did.","

"6","Come-and-Review","2 December 2014","This was a series I grew up with, but I'll try to stay objective with it.The animated series - can we say that? - evolved/grew up during the years. At the beginning it was really kid-friendly, but, years after year, season after season it started to be filled with quite gory/scary stuff I'd rather not show to a 6-7 years old kid. I don't think that's a negative side though, as this series managed to explain many empty points we had about either some events occurred in the movies, or the whole mysticism of the Force, a really good expansion of the saga -directly came from its inventor George Lucas - that helps fans understand better the star wars. As I already said, the series is not completely childish, and adults could enjoy it as well.Now, to the reason of why this didn't get a 10/10: the first season, and a few episodes we meet on the way that aren't really important story arcs. I must say that, despite season one is the only one I have on DVD, I don't really like it, has not many strong story arcs, as instead the other seasons have, also all seasons include several single episodes that are put just to fill the episode list. But yet this is saved by the absolute supremacy of the story arcs.","

"7","EarlGenesis","31 May 2020","The first two seasons of The Clone Wars are rather decent, but all of your interest will be completely captured once you begin S3 and onwards. The action is spectacular, the animation gets much better, the characters develop extremely well, and the story itself fits perfectly into the Star Wars story as a whole.","

"8","paul_haakonsen","12 June 2021","Right, well back in the day when ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" initially came out, I managed to sit through two seasons before giving up on the series. Why? Well, as much of a ""Star Wars"" fan as I am, then the animation and art style was just a bitter pill to swallow, and I never really been a fan of the Clone Wars era in the ""Star Wars"" universe.So I put the series to rest back then, but had to return to give it a second chance in 2021, as many people said that it got better with the later seasons. So I endured and sat through it. And true enough, you actually just have to get past the first one and a half seasons, then the series actually starts to pick up and improve greatly with each season. And especially seasons 6 and 7 were quite phenomenal.There are many, many different story arcs throughout the seven seasons, some with greater appeal and contents than others, of course. As it was to be expected from something running for seven seasons. So there is a great that that ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" actually holds something for just about any one in the audience.And I have to admit that I am glad that I returned to re-watch this and give it a second chance, because I was definitely missing out on a great many things, despite it being set in the Clone Wars era. And I also have to say that ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" definitely put Darth Maul in a whole new light for me. I didn't like him one bit when I saw him in ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", but ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" brings so much story to his character and really flesh him out - pardon the pun - to be a much more interesting character than what you see in ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"".Sure, the animation and art style used in ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" still is something of an acquired taste, but I came to bear with it. But it was by no means something that would win me over if it came down to that.The series delves greatly into the different story arcs for a great many characters, with the likes of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, Anakin Skywalker, Count Dooku, Padm√© Amidala, Cad Bane, and even clones such as Rex and Cody. Luckily and thankfully the abysmal clown known as Jar Jar Binks wasn't an overshadowing character in the series, as he didn't have that many appearances.""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" is definitely worth spending the time to sit down and watch. I happened to binge-watch all seven episodes over a course of a couple of days, and I was greatly entertained.My rating of ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" lands on an eight out of ten stars collectively throughout the seven seasons combined.","

"9","mixta110","13 October 2008","Well, after a sceptical start with the clone wars animated movie, the actual TV series is getting better and better. Slightly bumpy start however. (Droid voices????) But as the ""Shadow of malevolence storyline unfolds, it is clear that Star Wars is back in star wars territory. Great little storyline, and episode 3 is just true to the spirit of the original Trilogy and yet keeps with the clone wars setting. Episodes 4 & 5 are even better, and as a listener to the podcasts on theforce.net the interviews are brilliant too. The creators are aware of what we like and don't and they reassure us not to worry, as some very cool stuff is still in the pipeline. I even rewatched the clone wars movie again now its out on DVD and i like it 10 times better than i did before. I guess everything was new. I also found out that the movie was the first stuff they filmed for the series and that everything that has come since has been improved upon, and much has yet to be seen. I am looking forward to the episode i saw in a clip where we see a flashback of General Grievous become what he is now. Anakins character is actually likable now. And Asoka is less brattish than she was in the movie. Just a shame about the damn droid voices. Less is more sometimes eh! Well done George and the team. So far i'm loving it, and cant wait for each episode. Finally, some of us may actually understand what GL was trying to achieve with the prequels. The kids love it too. I hope it gets a little darker though, or at least remains at the level of the malevolence storyline. Cant wait for the LIVE ACTION show next year too, but I hope that one is gonna be dark and for the fans, and not for the kids. (As promised.) Then, i think balance will be achieved. Clone wars for the kids, fine. But if they make Star Wars TV for the fans, all may be forgiven.Oh, one last thing... Needs a little bit more John Williams score. Pleeease??? _______________________EDIT: 2010OK, series 2 is now half way through.... WOW!!!! It has just changed completely, series 1 was great with teathing troubles as I stated in my review. But series 2, THIS IS STAR WARS!! And its a shame to say it, especially as i didn't mind the prequels too much, but I wish they would re-do the prequels in this animated style. 100 times more character than the live action. I now LOVE this show. My only gripe now is with the Cartoon network, who keep skipping weeks of showing it. People keep missing it and viewing figures will drop, and its the show that will get the blame yet its because its hardly aired consistently. This has happened with LOST and other great TV. People miss it and then forget about it. TV is based on viewing figures, so let us view it damn it!Keep em coming and thank G for the darker more adult turn of series 2.","

"10","POIguy","15 April 2022","When The Clone Wars is at its best, it is quite possibly the best the Star Wars franchise has to offer. This show has some epic arcs, such as the Umbara arc, the Seige of Mandalore, and the Mortis arc. Storylines like these expand the lore of Star Wars and offer engaging and thrilling stories to latch onto. Unfortunately, the Clone Wars also has some not so thrilling arcs (basically anything to do with Jar-Jar or driods). I'm not sure why these arcs were put in here, but they ruin the show from being a 10/10. Other than these boring arcs, the rest of the show is fantastic. It's a show that's great for both kids and adults which is quite rare.","

"11","joseph_the_broseph","29 August 2018","Before I start, let me clarify: I am not a six-year old writing this based on watching seven episodes from Season 1. This is my favorite show and I have memorized every episode. So, let's get started!
This show is simple- it is, to put it in concise terms, a series of events happening between episodes 2 and 3 of the prequels. 
This show shows the progression of how the writers and animators weren't afraid to try new things after a while. 
Season 1 of this show is sort of dull. As I said, the creators weren't very brave at this point, and didn't really know what crossed the line. Soon, of course, they found out: THERE IS NO LINE. There are a few good episodes in the season, getting better as it comes to a close. But overall, it was just flashy lights and big noises- your typical kid's show. 
Season 2 is where they started accelerating, in terms of creativity. They made their first four-episode story arc, and made some pretty darn good standalones. ""Cat and Mouse"" was a particular favorite of mine.
Season 3 is where they really started putting some good stuff into the show. There was a lot more commentary, and the show got pretty intellectual and actually got older audiences thinking. The last few episodes of the season are where they really show their transition. The animators changed their style, and a lot of things changed, but I loved the change in the Jedi's clothing style and the beginning of this new, smarter, creative show that the people behind this masterpiece had just started.
Season 4 is where it gets great. What surprised me was the amount of violence. Clone Wars was no longer a show for seven year olds. Now it was a show for twelve and thirteen year olds, and for the parents watching too. They came up with some great stories, including ""Obi-Wan goes undercover,"" ""Water Wars"", ""General Krell,"" and of course, the revival of Darth frickin' Maul. That's right. They bring back Darth Maul. 
Anyway, Season 5 was all four-part arcs. (On the DVD version, Revival is right before Shades of Reason.) These were very interesting stories. The first arc, for example, is a strange meld of the American Revolution and the Vietnam War, as Jedi go to train people on another planet, who are looking to overthrow their tyrant ruler, King Rash. Sometimes, the arcs get too lighthearted (Like the one with R2-D2 and the frog colonel) but overall it was a good season, with an astonishingly beautiful, sad, and open ending.
Season 6 is where they just went nuts. Clone Wars was not on TV anymore, so they could do whatever they wanted. And the episodes in Season 6 went from Fives investigating something in the genetic code of the clones, to Anakin and Obi-Wan looking for clues as to the mysterious death of Sifo-Dyas. Great season. 
Anyway, Animation: Sort of lazy and generic at the start, but it sure got better. 18/20Plots: Started off bland, but got interesting very fast. 19/20Characters: Fleshed out over time, they were actually given real development. 19/20Soundtracks: At first, they were all very similar, and then they made themes, and started using an orchestra and made some music very satisfying for the 
ears. 18/20Voice Acting: Good. 17/20Overall rating: 91%","

I remember watching it at my grandparents house, then watched all subsequent episodes until it ended temporarily after season 5. I would wait earnestly for Friday night (or Saturday morning for season 5) for every episode to drop. I am glad to say that this is the show I grew up with.And then what do you know? They come back and finish it! The last arc of season 7 is something else.Thank you Dave Filoni, cast and crew for the amazing childhood memories.","

"13","zaidmnomani","25 July 2020","Star Wars the Clone Wars is set in the three years between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The story is about the intergalactic war between the Republic and the Separatists, also known as the Clone Wars. Oddly enough it is quite important in the Prequel trilogy and and was even mentioned in A New Hope, but never fully explored. I'm glad it wasn't though, because otherwise we would never get this fantastic show.Allow me to explain. It is generally agreed that although the prequels have interesting ideas and unique concepts, the execution is never fully delivers. Order 66, Palpatine as a traitor, Darth Maul, Anakin's fall to the dark side, all these ideas sound good on paper, but with the poor acting, bland CGI, awful dialogue and characters, the movies become really mediocre. However, with the Clone Wars show you understand what George Lucas was trying to go for.For example, Anakin is really likable here. He takes risks and is rebellious, but this usually pays of in the end. His main goal is to save and help as many people as possible, and put an end to the Clone Wars. He's usually quite laid back and overconfident, but not in a bad way. In the movies he's an annoying brat, but here you actually grow to care for him. After a while you remember this is the man who will become Darth Vader, and the Clone Wars makes his eventual fall all the more tragic. There are small hints and moments which foreshadow this, especially when Anakin loses his temper.Obi Wan Kenobi also gets a better treatment. Obi wan and Anakin have a best buddy/brother relationship over the course of the series. Which again, makes their eventual battle in Revenge of the Sith more heartbreaking. (This show is canon, in case you were wondering). Also, Obi wan is usually in the best story arcs. He's the only character who's every appearance is accompanied by an excellent show.There are plenty of other characters that are further developed. Padme has a fully fleshed out personality, and her views and ideals are are clear. Many of the Jedi Council members such as Yoda, Plo Koon, and Mace Windu are all give at least one arc which develops them more. Once again, it makes their deaths in Revenge of the Sith heartbreaking. Honestly, it should be legal requirement for every Star Wars fan to watch this show before Revenge of the Sith, because it improves that movie by 100%.The story line is not linear, which means most of the seasons have four or five self contained arcs with their own beginning , middle and end. This makes it extremely easy to start wherever you want, watch in any order, and skip episodes you don't like. Not all the stories feature Anakin and Obi Wan either. Some have Ahsoka Tano as the main character, who goes from being an annoying padawan to one of the the most iconic Star Wars characters of all time.Darth Maul returns from the dead in the Season 4 finale. I must say, he is the best thing to happen to this show. His burning hatred for Obi Wan Kenobi and desire for revenge are portrayed by the excellent voice acting and superb dialogue. The arcs he appears in are the highlights of the Clone Wars. I know I sound like a broken record at this point, but the Clone Wars once again improves upon the prequels by taking a generic and one note villain and turning him iconic.Some episodes feature just clones, which are some of my favorite. Over the course of the show the clones try to deal with their origins and become more independent. Captain Rex and Commander Cody are two of the most developed clones of all. Their is usually a really nice vibe in the clones only episodes. They are all voiced by the same actor and all look identical, and yet they always feel distinct and human. They encapsulate a lot of the recurring themes and and are the heart of the show.Speaking of themes, the Clone Wars has a lot to say on that front. Politics, Economics, the consequences and benefits of war are all here. If you ask me, the best kids shows are the ones that incorporate mature themes and explain them for kids to understand. They have something to say. If I ever have kids, I'd want them to watch this show, because it presents many different lessons that are not usually found in any media.The animation may be a bit jarring in the beginning, but it heavily improves every season. By the time we reach Season 7, the CGI is on the level of a movie. Because it is animated, the episodes can feature a wide variety of locations, species and battles. The world building is insane. The Star Wars galaxy has never felt bigger. Every planet has something unique and memorable about it, with it's own set of beliefs and idealsBecause of the episodic nature of the show, a wide variety of stories are told. Star Wars has so much more potential than the usual Empire vs Rebellion conflict, but this is the only form of Star Wars media that fully captures this potential. It explores the possibility of a galaxy in war, and the consequences of it as well.One thing that stopped me from watching this show until now is that it got cancelled In 2014, Star Wars The Clone Wars ended abruptly with Season 6, with many arcs left unfinished. But that is no longer a problem. The Clone Wars was brought back for it's final season just a couple of months ago. Now, no Star Wars fan has an excuse not to watch it. You can go through it whenever and however you want. It is a must watch for anyone who is remotely interested in the saga, for it is Star Wars at it's finest.","

"15","Med-Jasta","18 April 2020","It looks like Star Wars, sounds like Star Wars and feels like Star Wars. I was surprised to see that someone else actually understood Star Wars, because so far no one other than the creator has. Upon watching the special features I learned why. George Lucas is involved with everything. Go figure.The thing this show does best is not tie itself down to connecting with the movies. In Revenge of the Sith Obi, Anakin and Grevious meet for the first time. In the show they see each other all the time. Same with Dooku. In the movie they haven't met since Attack of the Clones, they see each other and fight all the time.Also since they've established that reality and the fact that it's a cartoon, it allows me to accept things that wouldn't fly in the movies. Like Darth Maul coming back. I love Maul as much as everyone else and I'd love to see more of him but he's dead. If the dismemberment to the abdomen didn't kill him then the fall certainly did. And there's absolutely nothing that could ever bring him back, not even the force. But since this is a cartoon, it's good to see him again.Anakin would've have an apprentice but it's a good story and Asoka is great. And the really genre specific stories, like zombies and monster stuff wouldn't fly in the movies but are cool here.The idea of a clone war show is great from the get go because in the movies we don't really see them. And General Grevious is so cool and we hardly get to see him so it's nice to have a show featuring him so heavily, doing all the things I was hoping to see in 3.The emphasis is on the action and it's so cool. They do a very good job of supporting themes and character traits from the movies.I like that not ever story follows our main guys. Sometimes they aren't in it at all. It's nice to follow those background Jedi that look so good and hardly have any screen time.After the movie this show gets dark pretty quick. A lot of cold blooded murder and scary monsters. That's what's so good about having a cartoon that isn't on Disney.One thing that I really love as a lifelong Star Wars fan is that they use unused ideas from the other movies. Repurposed or exact, it's great to see these ideas on screen. Having endlessly looked through the art books and hoping that there was only someway to use these great shelved ideas, I was very surprised to see them.I've watched it several times because it's so good.Unfortunately Disney cancelled it because they don't want anything to do with the prequels or a show not on their Network, leaving us without a conclusion. I don't think they really care about Star Wars, do you? Only money. That was strike 1. They dropped this successful show without an ending to make Rebels? That show sucked. And why? No Lucas.They've brought it back now but too late Disney, you've already burned this bridge. They brought it back because they need to do something to bring the fans back. They cancel it for no reason only a few years later to bring it back to appease the fans because they realized they screwed up? Their own ""original"" stories aren't pulling in fans? What a surprise.","

"16","martimusross","2 September 2021","Star Wars: The Clone WarsWell this just got better and better, personally I would have had a continuous narrative flow between episodes as we have seen how successful this approach is with The Mandalorian, even though this demands more of the viewer as there is scant recap, but to Star Wars ""nerds"" this is a joy!Also to vary episode lengths to cut the story by way of ""comas"" creates its own narrative impetus.Series 2 really stepped up, much darker, more complex, more depth, it was quite frankly brilliant! It just had more of everything with the best thing being comprehensively developed evil villains, intrigue and use of the force. I even think the animation was more creative. The change between series 1 and 2 is so great is quite inexplicable.Series 3 we had Zero Hut this was inspired from start to finish what a joy!Throughout the whole thing we have one terrible character, Padhme amadala, she is a mixture of condescension, passive aggression and negativity, she presents herself as a principled politician but she just latches onto one woke trope after another, usually at the expense of ridiculing men. It is rare to see writers so misunderstanding ""female empowerment"", instead they portray a bully in competition with men rather than the rounded and conflicted female character we see in Asoka Adana In the original movies this character injects humour, the onerous weight of responsibility and romance, they should have stuck with this! In series 3 episode 11 this culminated in arguing that the war against the Separatists should be conceded as the money spend on defending democracy should be diverted to the welfare state. Without grasping that democracy is suspended when a sovereign state is threatened as war cannot be conducted by committee, and without defending yourselves against tyranny there will be no state to speak of. It really was quite idiotic!Series 4 -7 started to show the war from different perspectives, we had an episode led by droids, we had an episode led by clones. This really was a very good idea and really kept the show fresh and allowed more in depth back stories.Overall this is beyond description in its reinvention, it characterisations, it story lines, the scoring, the animation. When you look to see how far animation has come in recent years and it's elevation to near parity with ""real actors"" it's mindblowing!I would not cancel this series but have several separate teams working on the Bad Batch, Clone Wars as there is room for both and more and fans are gathering to this work. I think better awareness is needed as I only recently discovered it.","

"17","alindsayal","23 December 2021","After many years and a big buildup we have finally seen the 7th and final season of The Clone Wars and I have finished the season and here is my review. The premise of the season sees Ahsoka attempt to move on from her exile from the Jedi while Captain Rex attempts to prepare his troops for the end of the war.Main Character
Even though the first few seasons focused on Anakin Skywalker in my opinion the real main character of the Clone Wars is easily that of Ahsoka as we see her story really develop through our eyes. From the movie where she is introduced as this young padawan to this season where she is more of this conflicted person who isn't exactly sure of her place in this war but also wants to help people and do things the Jedi won't. Her character is so well done this season and I think the way her arc ends this season is done flawlessly and really gives a payoff for really 12 years of a character on this show.Supporting Characters
The other original character that gets a great story arc is that of Captain Rex. To see his characrter arc from the movie to now is enthralling. This season alone you see his character go through all types of emotions, I think the point if this show was to make you care about The Clone Troopers and I really cared about Rex this season and thought he had a really interesting story. Maul was a character introduced in The Phantom Menace but in my opinion he didn't become an interesting character till he returned on this show. His character is very menacing but he is a great opposite to Ahsoka and there stories are fascinating, they are both thrust into the limelight away from there masters and you see Mauls own plans and how they affect the story. Anakin & Obi-Wan are in this season less but they are well handled, ties to Anakin's eventual turn are still here and are heavily implied. The relationship between Anakin & Ahsoka is pretty heartbreaking here and again it feels like a worthy payoff for the show.Story
The show has two great story arcs in it, seeing Rex and The Bad Batch's story was great showing the development of Rex and how the clones really differ at this point. Then Ahsoka's character plot is fascinating, this could be as a bit of a spoiler but the show comes to the point of crossing over with Revenge Of The Sith and the way it is handled is truly emotional. Plus with it being the end of the show is has to have a satisfying ending which this show truly does and it is handled perfectly. Though I have an issue with the story being the middle story with Ashoka hanging out with the Martinez sisters, as much as I like Ahsoka as a character I just didn't care for this story and it takes up way too many episodes with very little payoff in my opinion.Script
The script is brilliant this season, the drama feels much more mature this season and there are some truly gutwrenching moments that even though we have been expecting them I thought they were handled brilliantly. Also when used the humour is better this season and makes the characters feel much more human and a more complete package for the characters which previous seasons have lacked.Style
The style of the show is the best ever for sure, it is crazy to see how the animation has developed from the movie to now. The characters feel more alive and the action scenes are brilliant to watch. The lightsaber fight between Maul & Ashoka is memorable and a great moment which will stand out for many years to come. The show also benefits from having only 12 episodes and it flows much better then any of the other seasons for sure.Overall
Overall, this is easily the best ever season of the show it ends brilliantly and it really makes the 12 year journey feel worth it and this is easily one of the best Star Wars things around and I think may lead to Star Wars trying to nail more animated shows for sure.Rating - 9/10.","

"18","WeAreLive","22 August 2017","I finished watching the awesome Star Wars the clone wars yesterday and I have got to say the force is strong in this show.This show has pretty much every thing what a Star Wars fan would want, fight scenes, likable characters and of course different story arcs to keep you interested my favorite ones are when R2 D2 gets kidnapped by the separatist, the arc where the clones and the Jedi to protect a clone base and the one where Fives discovers his clone trouper chip. What more could you want?And it doesn't stop there the animation is awesome and the voice actors are incredible we even get guest stars like Nolan North, Liam Neeson, Seth Green, Gideon Emery, Simon Pegg and much more.At first, when I saw this back when I was younger I used to find it boring and annoying. But now I don't think that any more I think this an incredible show which needs a season 7.I would recommend this show to new and old generation of Star Wars fans.","

"19","Jonah_R","21 May 2020","I am writing this review now after the show has ended with the seventh season. And all i can say is wow...
I am so glad that I started watching this show, not only because it is fantastic on its own, but it also improves the prequels greatly.
I mean I have never hated the prequels and I actually like them, because I grew up with them and I still remember beeing 8 years old and seeing Revenge of the Sith in theaters which was just mind blowing for me back then.But back to Clone Wars.
I must admit that the first two seasons are not that good as the rest of the show. They are more kid friendly, the animations werent that good during this time and some of the plot lines werent that fascinating. But still, the first two seasons had their moment. Season 3 slowly started getting better and as soon as season 4 started, I could not stop watching the episodes. I got so hooked on it just binged through it.But what makes Clone Wars so good?
It simply expands the Canon, it gives us more information about the world of Star Wars, the Force, and a lot of characters who didnt get the opportunity to shine in the prequels get now the treatment they deserve
Characters like Captain Rex, Kit Fisto, Padme, Plo Koon, Mace Windu, Ki-Adi Mundi, Jar Jar, Grievious, Count Doku and a lot of others now get a real personality or are getting improved.
And of course Anakin, the Chosen One. He is the one who profits the most of Clone Wars. I get why a lot of people dont like him after the Prequels, but now... He is an amazing character in the show and you cant stop but love him. He gets so fleshed out that seeing him turn to the Dark Side is even more painfull now.
And the Clones in general. In the movies they are more like mindless soldiers but now they all get a personality and they are beeing developed into fascinating characters and we get now quite a lot different clones which are all different and you simply fall in love with them.
We also get a new look on older characters like young Boba Fett, Obi-Wan or yoda which is nice.
And what was really important to me, we get a closer look on how Palpatine was able to manipulate the whole Galaxy and rise to power.We have amazing plot lines that spand over multiple episodes. Some of them focus on politics and palpatines rise to power, other focus on the clones and are like a Vietnam war movie. There is something for everyone.On top on all of that we also get a lot new characters which are brilliant. First of all of course new adorable clones and most importantly. Ahsoka Tano, a character which I love. I dont want to take to much away, but there are really so many new characters which improved the universe and were responsible for many great plotlines. And also one of my favourite characters rises up from the dead and I jumped up with tears of joy when I saw him...And he ist not even wasted, but due to him we get some of the best Star Wars Storys ever, especially in the new season 7.And if we are allready starting to talk about season 7. The first few episodes were ok. nothing special... But the last four episodes of Clone Wars are killing it and are some of the best Star Wars moments ever.
And watching Episode III now feels like a totaly new experience which hits way harder then before.I could endlessly go on and on about why I love Clone Wars, but I think I made my point clear.
So I would definitly recommend this to every Star Wars fan who wants to now more about the world and the characters. You wont regret it","

But when I was 17 years old, I was staying at my grandparents house for an entire weekend, I was just watching tv when I came across a star wars marathon, it was currently showing the ending of episode 1, the duel of the fates battle, and I was instantly hooked, I sat there and watched all the prequels and eventually the originals, and my life was forever changed. I then found out there was actually a tv show about the prequels, and I watched it too. All these years later I am now a mega star wars fan, I have read most of the books and comics, ive seen all the movies and shows, and ive got to say ( if it already hasn't been said enough) this tv series is some of best star wars media in existence, perhaps even better than most of the movies. Despite being animated, this show deals with powerful themes, including good vs evil, war, politics, slavery, spirituality and identity. This show is not just for children, but for anyone who wants to see a true epic space opera.The story: Now while the prequels were fun movies, I will admit they have many flaws that keep the story from being truly great, and this show fixes that, it provides the viewer with the concept the prequels were trying to tell, but elevates it. The show is an anthology series, so there multiple battles that take place across multiple worlds, and the concept of each individual battle being apart of a full galactic wide war taking place across several years is just as grandiose as you can get. The humor used never messes up the tone, but there is still a lot of lighthearted moments. No not every episode is great, the first 2 seasons are more kid friendly, but the majority of episodes are very complex and intense, in fact past season 3 the show becomes dark. The political scenes in this show really make this feel more than just an action show, the politics are engaging and you can just see how palpatine is playing both sides of the war. The truly tragic part of this story is that it will end with the republic and the Jedi being killed, but you know what its an epic story, and each episode really plays a part in constructing this fantastic narrative that inevitably leads to the events of revenge of the sith.The Battles: Most battles look like their renditions of famous battle sequences from famous war movies such as black hawk down, saving private ryan and Apocalypse now. Each battle is just epic in scope from land, to underwater to in space. Now as much as I love blaster fights, I am truly enamored with the lightsaber fights, the way each fight is done is truly stunning and done in a way that none of the live action lightsaber fights can even compete with. Despite some earlier fights looking clunky, later season fights look almost like realistic sword fights, with technique and style, not to mention the addition of force powers, there is no other sci fi battles that can amaze me as much as these. Also what gives each of these battles depth and tension is that there is death, not just off screen either, we see people get killed in truly spectacular and tragic ways. The best fights are totally rewatchable, that makes this show so much more mature and in some instances even compete with the likes of game of thrones in violence. The best part about the action in the show is that unlike so many other action shows or movies, its not just action for the sake of action, but for the sake of complimenting the story, so each battle is truly meaningful.The characters: Now what makes this truly work is its large cast, which if done wrong, could have ended badly, but you know what, almost every character you meet is likeable and badass in their own way. The jedi, clones and even the villains are given true character and receive impressive development that make them memorable and just amazing. If you don't already know, Ashoka tano is one of the best new star wars characters, and that's because of good development and great writing. And as for the already established prequel characters such as Anakin skywalker and Obi wan Kenobi, they are improved drastically from the movie versions, and become the best characters in the show to the point you dread the day that they will fight each other on mustafar. The characters are done so good, that even the most obscure character deaths will make you feel some sorrow, because of stakes and emotions done right. The dialogue is excellent and compelling, its so good that it really fleshes out the characters, and makes the story very engaging.The animation:
While I wasn't a fan of the CGI animation in the beginning, its grown on me. However the earlier seasons have very clunky animation and can be off putting, but after season 3 the animation only improves and becomes downright beautiful to look at. The animation eventually improves so much in the later seasons that backgrounds and set pieces look almost cinematic and jaw dropping.The Force: The force is truly something unique, as well as its users, the jedi and the sith, this is what separates star wars from other sci fi content. As much as I like clones, rebels, droids and other soldier content, its the jedi and the sith that made me a star wars fan. I am a sucker for any lore I can find about the force and its users. And this show provides a lot of philosophy and lore on exactly what the force is. This show explores the concept of the force and how it provides power to the jedi and sith, making it feel like a tangible living thing.This show truly improve the prequels, and shows us the true clone wars, and the potential star wars possess. Id like to take the time to thank Dave Filoni, and the creator himself, George lucas for bringing this show to existence. This show is truly something to behold, granted its not a perfect show ( but which one is ) all that's important is that this made me love the universe of star wars even more. while I don't think its essential, I feel if you want the most fulfilling star wars experience ever, you should watch this after episode 2 and before episode 3 to have the story feel as grandiose as possible and trust me you wont be disappointed. This show is so rewatchable and every watch feels fresh every time. What's most exciting is that after a 6 year hiatus, the seventh season was made, ad it completes the show perfectly tying it to the events of revenge of the sith, and it is quite possibly one of the most satisfying yet bittersweet tv finales ever made. A quote was said in the trailer for this last season, ""clone wars is saved"", but Id prefer ""STAR WARS is saved"". May the Force be with you all.","

Let me tell you the clone wars is unbelievably good and it is all cannon
Palapatine , obi wan, anakin,yoda,mace plus all the jedi you only get a short glimpse of in the movie are in this show,
even characters from episode 4 ,rogue one and rebels
This is not a just kids cartoon
80 % of the time this looks like it was made for adult fans .
The only reason i gave it 9 is the 20% of the time when they do the childrens episodes ie silly creatures and driods adventures but nevertheless still good.
Some episodes beat the newer 3 movies .
Tons of action , great story, and great characters plus you get to fill in the missing bits from the films in particular grievous","

"23","magnus_nilsson99","6 January 2021","Clone Wars has its UPS and downs like a rollercoaster . For exanple Often they use force pull/push as a diciding factor for the character succeed or not . This is really lazy writing and there is more plot holes that is strange and destroys som of the fun for me ! The series takes off in a good way in season 4 , before that it was OK. The end was so awsome the 4 last episodes, that I wish for a remake with the same cutting and camera shots . Here Star Wars really shines and I Got goosebumps in the last shot 10/10 !!","

After watching the first two episodes aired tonight on Cartoon Network, I can safely say my anticipation was rewarded. Judging by these two episodes, I can see that a lot of work has been put into this series, and it's not just something for the kiddies to watch. It was watching a mix of the humanity of original trilogy with the action of the new trilogy. It's a great show, and definitely worth a watch for Star Wars fans of all ages. Just give it a try, you're bound to love it.","

"25","m-betts06","9 November 2008","I have been watching this series since it came out, and thank god i taped them as i have watched each episode up to 4 times each now.Absolutely awesome series! I was sceptical at first, and it started off a little ropey but now i'm hooked. I'm up to episode 6 so far, and every episode has literally gotten better and better and better.Evry episode that has come out since the movie i have said this is the best episode so far, and thats a good thing! I believe there are meant to be a hundred or more episodes of this show? I hope thats so, and i wish i had them all right now! I would not be seen for weeks.Anakin is great in this, better than the live action films IMO. And Asoka is pretty cool too, although she got off to a bumpy start.In fact i only have a few subtle gripes, Droid voices, though i'm getting used to them. A bit short each episode, but at least it leaves me wanting more. Which is good. Lack of John Williams music throughout, and the last episode had drum n bass in it, which was bizarre and unwelcome! But still, these are only minor gripes, and I know the creators are working on making it better for series 2 according to the force-casts, so hopefully if these little gripes get fixed, the show should be perfect.Oh and as for the 2 reviews on here that are super negative, and say its not for the true fan, well, I AM THE TRUE FAN! And i like it! Sounds like a couple of nay-sayers to me, jumping on the Lucas hate bandwagon. Wouldn't surprise me if they hadn't even watched an episode of this show at all. Guess thats the internet for ya.Anyway, keep em coming! Keep em great! Adjust as necessary and Star Wars will be great once more for the next generation. And the old one.","
