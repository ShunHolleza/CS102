"The Avengers","SPZMaxinema","21 August 2021","This might be controversial to say but this is my personal favorite MCU movie. Up until this point, nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently. Going into this movie in 2012 (having only seen Iron Man beforehand) I was skeptical and not interested. Then my brother took us to the theater to see it and it was one hell of a blast. I was blown away and wanted to watch all of the other Phase 1 movies and learn more about these other heroes. The casting and chemistry between them is on point, the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way, and Robert Downey Jr.'s humor all around is unforgettable, and how can I not mention that glorifying theme song?? Not to mention Stan Lee's perfect cameo!","10/10"
"The Avengers","aidanratesmovies","24 June 2021","It's a film that future generations will still be gushing about, much like previous generations did with such classics as Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand. Besides that though, there isn't many flaws. The acting is rather good, Samuel L. Jackson may take a line too seriously or too, but it's all in good fun. Again Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a major standout, and I also enjoyed the return of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth Thor- as well as an improved performance by Chris Evans as Captain America and a great performance from replacement Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo. The action scenes are exciting and tense, there is some camera angles here and there that can be a bit annoying, but for the most part it is rather clear and not awfully tedious action- as many films of this type could be. In the end, despite its campiness and formulaic actions- The Avengers is an incredibly fun time. It takes pride in its stories and characters and makes the most out of an experience that could have easily been phoned in. Its a film that will live on for some time, and one i'm rather glad I got to experience first hand.My Rating: 9.4/10.","9/10"
"The Avengers","ivo-cobra8","2 July 2017","Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that. Mark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.The pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's. It was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.Admittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.The Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out. Marvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon. I have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films. The rating I give is 10/10","10/10"
"The Avengers","TheLittleSongbird","10 August 2014","Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox","9/10"
"The Avengers","dollybear-07164","31 May 2021","I watched this movie when I was younger and it was probably my favorite marvel movie until Infinity War or Endgame. Loki was a fun villain ngl. It was when the Avengers first assembled so it's a pretty important movie. Nothing can replace it.","9/10"
"The Avengers","krieg8814254","12 April 2012","I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies I've ever seen. It's almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It's not a two dimensional ""team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho."" Most don't like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work ""the other side of the fence"" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you're obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I'm just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that. This movie defines MUST SEE.","10/10"
"The Avengers","facebook-124-955845","20 April 2012","I'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiative¬Öin that short scene, the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye  (Jeremy Renner) as ""assembled"" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god  Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to ""hulk out"". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for  me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its  caliber.  Grade: A+","7/10"
"The Avengers","NORTHPOINTMJM","19 April 2012","If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie really did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film. I couldn't be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, there's the popcorn fun we were all expecting but there's also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well. It's truly a stupendous movie regardless of genre.Marvel did it, they pulled off the culmination of a master plan that's been taking shape for years. They deliver a movie the likes of which we've never seen before and as good of a film that's ever been made in its genre.There's a reason this grand of a movie has never been attempted before now. How do you fully flesh out, care about and establish this vast group and still deliver a fun, crisp and coherent story? It's extremely difficult to navigate that edge-of-your-seat excitement while at the same time caring about each one of the characters and their struggles. One of the most impressive aspects of The Avengers is that they managed to get each hero their time in the spotlight and their own character arc. Every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable intelligence and given room to shine.I loved that the stakes in this film are ridiculously high and the threat so impressive that there really is a need for these diverse characters to come together. That could have been a stumbling block in terms of story but it's treated just right. It's also a great idea that they chose to introduce all the characters to the audience as if you've never seen them before. Sure, the other films set up and give depth to each character but even if you missed their solo films, you'll still know and care about them in this movie.It's also wonderful that everything is as big as it should be. This truly is the comic book epic of our lifetime (the fanboy version of Gone With The Wind circa 1939 if you will) and it all shows up on screen. Everything looks GREAT and feels epic. The equipment (love that Helicarrier), the relationships, the stars, the characters themselves and the battles are all huge and as fully mesmerizing as they should be. There are scenes that are emotional and there are scenes that are going to make any audience member scream ""BADASS!"" and mean it.I'm serious when I say that the big, explosive moments are as grand as they should be but it's the smaller character moments in this film that really take it to another level. At this point, we've all seen how good some CG action can get but grounding it with a great story and with meaningful quieter moments is what makes a movie good. That's the ace up the Avengers sleeve. This is NOT some CGI video game movie. Cut out the action and I'd still want to see this movie. So, it's safe to say that they are replicating the comic book experience on the big screen. Years of depth coupled with spectacle and advanced fiction is a treat for non-comic book and comic book fans alike. That's is The Avengers greatest power... the ability to entertain all comers!","8/10"
"The Avengers","planktonrules","12 May 2012","At this point, ""The Avengers"" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...","9/10"
"The Avengers","CalRhys","12 July 2014","'Avengers Assemble' ('The Avengers') is a truly enjoyable superhero film that lives up to its hype and creates a story that allows for four of the greatest superheroes to connect in this mega-blockbuster extravaganza. Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed Marvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in 3D, the film is equally as stunning on an average television set, with the final battle between the Avengers and Loki's army being one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie. An impressive and remarkable fantastical superhero flick from Whedon.","9/10"
"The Avengers","andreascaloni","12 April 2021","The Avengers follows Nick Fury and the spy agency S. H. I. E. L. D. recruiting Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth. The movie has a very good balance of heroism and humour, great characters' development, an interesting villain, great action-packed sequences and a big use of the CGI. The film has a little slow part near the beginning. Nevertheless it is a mostly epic addition to the Infinity Saga.Rating: 7,8.","10/10"
"The Avengers","Gordon-11","18 March 2015","This film tells the story of a team of superheroes who save the world from an evil and ambitious extraterrestrial man.Being a blockbuster, ""The Avengers"" does have all the elements to entertain the crowd. The idea of putting all the superheroes in one film is a good idea, because viewers get great value for the price of a ticket. The stellar cast and the constant action is quite amazing. The visual effects are great, especially the finale which lasts for an hour! The massive destruction of Manhattan is literally earth shattering, I was quite in awe of the aliens flying through the skyline, and all the action that goes on. I enjoyed the film a lot.","10/10"
"The Avengers","blueyourrivalbot","17 June 2021","The score, the CGI, the writing, the humor, all of it is just top notch!Especially the legendary scene where Tony Stark falls out of the building and the suit activates and builds around him, not a scene to forget. The scenes where he lands at the Stark Tower landing pad and the machines automatically took off his suit is also unforgettable. How all of the agents have different plans, and how this will create conflict, but at the end, when they defeat Loki, they are together again. This movie also serves a major purpose as all of these people have met each other for the first time.If you have watched all of the other Avengers movies, it is pretty funny to see how they have grown with each other. The theme song, composed by Alan Silvestri took this movie to a whole new level. And how this theme song evolved in the later Avengers movies. Even hearing it now gives me chills.","10/10"
"The Avengers","IonicBreezeMachine","6 April 2023","At a S. H. I. E. L. D. facility researching the power source known as the Tesseract, Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) oversees the research being conducted by Erik Selvig (Steelan Skarsgard) with the Tesseract seeing some unusual activity. Eventually the Tesseract brings forth Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who has acquired a staff that gives him substantial power and uses it to steal the Tesseract and take control of Selvig and S. H. I. E. L. D. agent Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). In response to the threat posed Fury sends agent Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to recruit Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) due to his expertise in Gamma Radiation being necessary in tracking the Tesseract and also brings in Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and the recently revived Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) to assist in a battle which also sees the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who comes to stop his brother Loki.The Avengers is a 2012 superhero film and the concluding chapter to the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The amount of buildup leading into the Avengers was nothing short of astounding only made even more so when you consider the hurdles this series went through to get to this point. While the MCU had been planned in advance, unlike the comic books it was based upon which had to rely on coordinating the artists, writers, and editors, the films had all that in addition to budgets, casts, and general feasibility with the noted departure of Edward Norton as Bruce Banner following disagreements over 2008's The Incredible Hulk which ended up being downplayed in terms of its significance to the overall universe, and uncertainty that Scarlet Johansson would even return as Black Widow with a back-up script featuring the inclusion of The Wasp briefly considered. However following re-writes by director Joss Whedon that elaborated on Zak Penn's original script, the script and cast was set including a soft relaunch of the Hulk character with Mark Ruffalo stepping in for Norton. Upon release the film garnered the best receives of the series since the original Iron Man and became a massive hit too with a $200 million opening weekend in the United States that carried it to $600 million domestically and $1.5 million worldwide that most likely gave Paramount massive sellers remorse for only taking a little over $100 million for distribution of Avengers and Iron Man 3....whoops. All these years later now free of the buildup and hype that propelled it to blockbuster status, does The Avengers still hold up? In short, yes it does.The movie does a good job of including and paying off all the characters and plot threads established over the previous films with every character getting their chance to shine even seemingly minor characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow who didn't get to do much in their debuts in Thor and Iron Man 2 respectively, but do feel like they're allowed to make more of an impression this time around and get some solid standout moments despite being alongside their powered colleagues. Robert Downey Jr. Is really good as Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth remains good as Thor, and Chris Evans is still as effortlessly likable as Captain America and his traditional values where he fought more overtly evil antagonists are contrasted well against a world with more shades of grey to it and is probably one of the reasons why Captain America's movies tended to be the best in this franchise. The movie also gives some great moments to its supporting cast including Clark Gregg's welcome return as Agent Coulson, Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson get some fun moments as Hawkeye and Black Widow, and Mark Ruffalo gets a fantastic introduction as Bruce Banner/Hulk with some solid pathos from the character as well as some genuinely amusing humorous moments especially in the climax. Loki is also a solid antagonist who is wonderfully despicable embracing his ""trickster"" persona as someone who has considered every possible angle and wants his adversaries to know it. There is the occasional gaffe in storytelling such as with Loki's ""partners"" purposefully kept off screen for the sake of laying groundwork for more sequels and I wasn't quite sure how Thor found out about the Chitahuri (or even their name for that matter) but these are minor nitpicks in a movie that delivers everywhere it should.The Avengers is the gold standard for modern ""cinematic universes"" and many have tried to copy its formula to only modest success if at all (I'm sure we all remember the Dark Universe...oh wait, no we don't). The Avengers does a good job of balancing many moving parts and characters and feels like a well worth it pay off to the films that preceded it while also laying the groundwork for what's to come.","5/10"

"The Avengers","billygoat1071","25 April 2012","The Avengers movie must be a dream come true to everyone. Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen. While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.Our modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.Maybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.There are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the best of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen.","10/10"

"The Avengers","lee_eisenberg","16 April 2018","The 21st century has seen more superhero movies than I can count. This year alone has already seen ""Black Panther"". I won't deny that Stan Lee created a diverse variety of do-gooders in the Marvel Universe. ""The Avengers"" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters, Sheldon Coopers, Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in ""An American Werewolf in London""). I'd like to see a crossover between this movie and John Landis's horror movie.Anyway, it's not the ultimate masterpiece, but undeniably fun.","9/10"
"The Avengers","seruanyre","16 January 2023","So I recently watched ""The Avengers"" and let me tell you, it was lit. The action scenes were insane and the special effects were on point. But what really stood out to me was the chemistry between the characters, it was like they had been a team for years. I mean sure, As a huge fan, it was amazing to see them share the screen with all these other badass heroes. Overall, I highly recommend checking out ""The Avengers"" if you haven't already. Trust me, you won't regret it.The casting in Avengers is truly exceptional. Each actor effectively embodies their respective character, bringing them to life on screen. Chris Evans portraysals the role of Captain America with a sense of responsibility and gravitas, while Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man is both charming and entertaining. Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk, brings a level of vulnerability and empathy to the character that has never been seen before. Chris Hemsworth, as Thor, seamlessly blends power and humor, and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is fierce and formidable. But perhaps the stand-out performance is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, who imbues the villain with a charm and intelligence that commands the audience's attention throughout the film.The story of Avengers: Endgame is expertly crafted, weaving together a diverse array of characters and plotlines from the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a cohesive and impactful manner. The film is packed with unforgettable moments, from the grandiose action sequences to the more intimate, emotional moments. The climax of the film is truly a sight to behold, bringing all the characters together in a thrilling and satisfying conclusion.Overall, The Avengers is a must-see film. It is a marvel of filmmaking and storytelling, and it will be recognized as one of the best superhero films of all time.","10/10"
"The Avengers","dee.reid","9 July 2012","As you well know by now, ""The Avengers"" is a large-scale superhero film that was four years in the making, with no less than four individual - yet inter-connected superhero films - feeding into this film's overall story. Joss ""Firefly"" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets ""The Avengers"" many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind. Sit back and enjoy!10/10P.S.: What happened to Dr. Henry ""Hank"" Pym/Giant-Man and Janet van Dyne/The Wasp? Weren't they part of the original Avengers team line-up (before ""The Avengers #4"" when Captain America became team leader, marking the character's Silver Age debut)? This was my only real complaint about ""The Avengers.""","9/10"
"The Avengers","francoischristana","22 October 2023","It is shocking to me that Loki's personal resentment against Thor led to all of this destruction. For what reason did he believe that he would just take control and dictate Earth without any consequences? Earth is not at an advantage in battle, so Nick Fury had the right of using the Tesseract to create weaponry. It took some time to get everyone on the same page, but in the end, their shared goal inspired them to work together as a team, which is why I admired how the Avengers came together. I have never watched the Marvel series before, but now I am totally invested. I am curious to know since Loki did not keep his promises to the Chitauri what will happen next.","10/10"
"The Avengers","brandon_lee420","24 April 2012","Believe me when I say that 'The Avengers' was my most anticipated movie ever. I mean, come on, a bunch of superheroes gathering and fighting evil, that is just priceless. And not any superheroes but the most well-known and well-loved. The movie has some of the best actors in Hollywood portraying some of the best superheroes to have ever been created. This movie has loads of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, and, needless to say, Hulk Smash! They were all portrayed on screen brilliantly and I give thanks to the actor for making them feel awesome, cool, and really, really fun. I live in Australia and we get an earlier viewing of the film but for you Americans, this wait is is worth it. When the movie was over, most of the cinema clapped - this was the first time I had ever seen this ever at the movies. Even though it was 12 in the morning, the whole cinema was packed and all of them came out of the cinema satisfied and were glad they paid the $13 to watch it.The plot of the movie is straightforward but done magnificently. Loki, previously seen in Thor, wants to wreak havoc on Earth by letting a group of aliens enter Earth through a portal. It's up to the Avengers to stop him but first they have to solve the rivalries and bitterness between them. The fight scenes between the superheroes are just f*cking AWESOME! I was so excited to see Thor and Iron Man battle it out - that scene was just plain epic.The music and soundtrack in the movie was good and it did a nice job of alleviating the action, and trust me there is a LOT of action. The visual effects are also fantastic, one of the best I have ever seen in a film, and they will leave you in awe. Hulk, along with Iron Man, do a good job of adding humour into the film and ALL of the scenes with the Hulk left everyone at the cinemas laughing. It is pretty obvious that his squad mates think highly of him as seen in the scene where Stark and Loki have a confrontation ('We have an Army' , 'We have a Hulk'). That scene was what did it for me.If you guys are in doubt as to see this then let me assure you that you are gonna get the bang for your buck that you deserve. So far, it is one of the best superhero film made but of all time? Not really sure, guess we have to wait for TDKR to come out. 10/10 - Perfect! 'Over and Out.' 25 April 2012","9/10"
"The Avengers","Allswell007","14 April 2012","I just loved Marvel's Avengers. I thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered! This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember when I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat. Example: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said for every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what makes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, GI Joe and even Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and delivers depth with its fun.I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years if not ever!","1/10"
"The Avengers","saadgkhan","21 May 2012","The Avengers ‚Äì CATCH IT ( A+ ) The anticipation for the avenger's movie is undeniable. We have been waiting for this from years. To understand the Avenger's movie it's really important that you've seen all previous Ironman, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America's movies. As the avenger's give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the avengers empty headed about hero's history will be foolish. The Avenger's brings back our beloved Marvel's heroes Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury. Each hero's journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies. Now, The Avenger's stands strong in every department, from direction, production and performances. It won't be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes. The humor, action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous Marvel movies combined. The credit goes to generous brain of Joss Whedon. He brings out something very special out of each superhero. The interaction between all superheroes is something we don't see often, they tease, make fun and even fight with each other. Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman) is great as always. He brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is truly a god of thunder. His entry is as Big as Thor's entry should be, it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him. Chris Evens (Captain America) is indeed the ultimate American Hero, he got the charm and personality of a true America hero. Some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to Mark Ruffalo (The Incredible Hulk). For the first time we see some humor in the actions of Hulk, he is just not a fury green monster this time around. besides Hulk, the biggest surprise is Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), we have seen the part of her in Ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of Black Widow. She is absolutely stunning and fantastic. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is good and I hope to see him someday with Black Widow. They had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson the S.H.E.I.L.D are fun to watch. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is superb, he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in Thor, he has out done himself again. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) appearance is appreciated and I would have loved to see Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) in it too. On the whole, The Avengers is the finest brilliant superhero movie of all time, it's filled with great performance, humor, action, graphics and brilliant direction. Highly recommended in 3D.","6/10"
"The Avengers","biochemist","16 April 2012","LA Review of 'The Avengers' (No spoilers)I was lucky enough to attend the Marvel screening of 'The Avengers' on Saturday morning in Century City, CA. This was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before it's release date. Just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director Joss Whedon walked in with Kevin Feige to introduced their little ""Justice League"" movie. Not only did we all laugh, but some booed. lol. If that wasn't enough of a surprise, the soft spoken Whedon introduced on stage Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill). Wow is she stunning in person! The audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (This explained why the secret service like security were searching, wanding everyone. No cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) What a nice surprise for an early Saturday morning screening. I've never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of comics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another. Capt. Steve Rogers was fighting in WWII just yesterday. Having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us. The God of Thunder, Thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesn't understand modern technology on Earth as well. Dr. Bruce Banner has been on the run from the government, practicing medicine in third world countries. He hasn't been the Hulk in two years (What's his secret? ;). Tony Stark is still the same, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. So how do you get them all to interact and play well together? Well, Director Joss Whedon is the secret to making it all work. The highlight of the film for me is how Joss Whedon has all these characters interact. Deep character development was not needed for this film. (That is what the respective movies are for: Thor, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger) He does a great job of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than I would have ever anticipated. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. He took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly looking characters and made it completely work. Seeing as the Avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he not only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen. The movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. A couple of dialogue lines seemed off, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it all makes sense. Each respective character is true and honest to itself. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. It is by far the best Marvel movie to date.So who was my personal favorite character from the movie? Dr. Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) of course! He is by far the BEST Bruce Banner/Hulk since Bill Bixby. His intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than Tony Stark's) and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. As a kid growing up, he was my favorite Marvel super hero. I enjoyed watching Bill Bixby play medical doctor/physicist Dr. David Banner on television. I'd watch, terrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. Yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist, helping those in need. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn't know what to think of it. I knew that he's a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner. Or at least, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. He was a natural fit for this role. Overall, the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye candy. They all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. Assembled, they are unstoppable. When i heard an Avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. The day has finally come. Go see it. Thrice. 10/10 Stars.","4/10"

"The Avengers","Dan_W_Reviews","11 February 2023","The Avengers features an ensemble cast of some of the biggest and best names in Hollywood, including Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye just to name a few.The film's writing is excellent, it has a very well-structured and engaging storyline that effectively balances the different characters and subplots in a way many crossover superhero films lack. The film's humor is also noteworthy point for me, with Joss Whedon's signature wit on full display throughout. The action scenes are also visually stunning and exciting, with the special effects and CGI in particular being dazzling.The acting is also fantastic, with each actor bringing their A-game to their respective roles. The chemistry between the cast is magnificent, with the various characters bouncing off of each other in a way that is both entertaining and believable.Overall, in my opinion the Avengers is an excellent superhero film that is sure to enthral with its strong writing, excellent performances, and exciting action scenes. I've rated it a 9/10 primarily for its effective storytelling, top notch action sequences, and standout performances from its talented cast.","5/10"
"The Avengers","scotts863","21 April 2012","I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event.","1/10"
"The Avengers","Kia00","14 April 2012","This remarkable movie easily fulfilled and then exceeded all expectations. I've been waiting for this movie since Sam Jackson's character uttered those famous words after the first Iron Man film... Stark now knows he's not the only superhero in his world and it's as big a treat for our real world as it gets. Seeing the ""Avenger Initiative"" in action is as great as I would ever have hoped! Hell, who am I kidding, I've been waiting to see this movie all my life. Who would've thought years ago that ALL these characters could fit in to a film and all of them be done justice? It delivers greatness from scene one and has to be considered the best this genre has EVER produced. Truthfully, as good as some of the previous work has been from every studio, nothing else has come close. That's not hyperbole; I really think most will agree if they see it with an open mind. I loved this movie's depth, heart, humor, gravitas, action, performances, emotion and payoff. I honestly can't wait to see it again with the rest of the world later. Right now, I'm simply basking in the greatness I just witnessed!","1/10"
"The Avengers","maddog-50","11 May 2012","film studios just found out that a lot of moviegoers rely on ""reviews"" like internet buyers rely on customer reviews. It is known, that many big internet shops hire review-agencies those only job it is to fake authentic looking customer reviews because a lot of buyers trust the reviews of other customers more than any magazine reviews.That's what is happening here. 80% of the reviews here are written by professional review-agencies which got paid by the studios. If you look closer and compare the text of those ""best movie ever"" reviews (or variations of that, such as ""i did not expect much, i am not a superhero fan, but this was greatest beyond belief"" ) with reviews written at other moviegoer platforms, you will find a lot of equal phrases and text blocks.I guess that IMDb is aware of that cheating and they support it. This movie is another superhero movie with the very same formula. Superheros need super problems to solve, so that they can shine. Each hero has to face the kind of super problem which is appropriate to his/her individual super powers. They only can defeat the evil threat when they work as a team. But suddenly some social problems between them jeopardize the whole mission to save the humanity from that super tread, as you can guess, and only towards the end they find together again and etc., etc.. A story for retarded eight-year-old's, flavored with as much CGI as you little brain can swallow in the time.A stupid movie with a stupid story, stupid characters with stupid attitudes, stupid CGI and a stupid ending. If super stupid means blockbuster, then here you go.","4/10"
"The Avengers","secondtake","26 May 2013","The Avengers (2012)First: this is high energy stuff with lots of superhero fighting. Lots. Beyond that I had to pick and choose what I liked and what seemed to be dragged out a bit. It was never slow, but it was often a bit uninteresting.the real downside to the movie was, well, the plot, which had yet another super huge super awful enemy that required our local team to go out and find a way to conquer. It never really mattered why these bad people were coming (though they do explain why, with a spacey glowing cube and Thor's half-brother having some childhood issues unresolved). The set design, however, was really ambitious, not only with the huge scenes and big CGI effects, but the range and diversity of interiors with a deliberate variety of styles that related to the different characters. And some of the actors and actresses were terrific to watch, even if they didn't really have much to say or do that mattered (besides save the world, of course).If this sounds like I'm not cut out of this type of movie you are mostly wrong. I have loved, for example, the three Nolan ""Batman"" movies, a couple of the ""Spiderman"" ones, and a few oddballs here and there, all of which work on some of the same principles of super villain and a modified New York (Gotham, etc.) as a city of resilient victims to save.Small (relevant) confession: I loved the Iron Man movies and never saw any of the other Marvel character movies like the Hulk. In this all-star get together of a half dozen famous super-heroes I naturally loved the Iron Man parts and was neutral on the rest. Mostly because Robert Downey Jr. is a huge cut above the others of the cast in presence, in humor, in making the whole enterprise a comic book come to life, not a serious save-the-world epic. By contrast, the leader of the bad guys is a wan, half-hearted baddie who didn't create the chills or fear the movie badly needed. As a movie of characters taken from various Marvel comic book (and movie) series, it was how fully the characters were realized that made the difference. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was pretty great, though restrained a bit. The Black Widow in the hands of Scarlett Johansson was stunning to look at but also weirdly restrained (except the fighting of course). Thor was a bore, taking his old school power thing too too seriously. And Captain America, though a likable, cute guy, was also a bad casting job--he had to do more than look good (unlike, say, Gwyneth Paltrow, who simply had to look good since she unfortunately had nothing much to say or do).You'll know if this movie is your thing before you read this or see a trailer. It's a boiler plate super hero action movie with lots of computer effects and a standard villain from the universe menace. (The computer effects, like these skeletal ocean monsters swimming through Manhattan wrecking lots of buildings, are actually, surprisingly, a bit clunky once you start watching the details.) Overall, director and writer Joss Whedon seems a bit overwhelmed here, and has co-written a predictable bit of very expensive contemporary Hollywood stuff and then directed it without quite making it special. Or surprising. I mean, even Samuel L. Jackson is stiff and preachy. The movie has its moments for sure, but that's not enough. Disappointing.","10/10"
"The Avengers","gradyharp","30 September 2012","Has the global situation grown so bleak that the populace has regressed to comic books for escapism entertainment?

"The Avengers","moonspinner55","6 May 2012","Simple-minded live-action comic book extravaganza uniting Earth's resident superheroes to thwart Thor's adoptive brother Loki and his faceless army from destroying the world. The 3D effects aren't terribly good, though the film looks expensive and is top-heavy with crushing destruction (taking place in Manhattan, somewhat disconcerting in the post-9/11 years), coupled with blisteringly loud sound effects. Robert Downey Jr. brings his usual panache to the fore as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Chris Evans is a wonderfully well-scrubbed Captain America, but others in the all-star cast (particularly Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Ruffalo and, in a cameo, Gwyneth Paltrow) just appear to be slumming. The script (by Joss Whedon, who also directed) could only be amazing and complex to comic book fans who haven't been comic book fans for very long. It's a mechanical enterprise for audiences looking to be uplifted by the sight of buildings (and people) being obliterated...and the patriotic revenge therein. ** from ****","9/10"
"The Avengers","thefilmexpert","30 April 2012","Have movies become so bad these days that a merely well-executed totally formulaic film, like ""The Avengers,"" is heralded as an exceptional film?Sure, this film hits all the marks and has some good one-liners, but once we expected films to be refreshing and new. ""Star Wars,"" while having obvious flaws, provided us a totally new universe with its own unique political conflicts, worlds, and even its own theology (the force). Its first twenty-minutes is mostly watching the story of a robotic English dandy (C3-P0) argue with a chirping rolling trashcan (R2-D2), but amazingly enough Lucas made that unique and crazy idea entertaining. The plot of ""The Avengers"" is just your run-of-the-mill comic book story-line. Compare its plot to that of ""Inception"" or ""The Matrix"" or even ""Back to the Future"" or ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Much of what makes those films so great is that their plots are highly innovative. You have no idea where they are going. You always know exactly where ""The Avengers"" is going. Along these same lines, ""Psycho,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""The Matrix,"" etc. provide classic twists--Norman has gone insane and has, in his mind, become his mother, the film's apparent killer; Darth Vader, the film's main villain, is revealed to be Luke's father; the first half of ""The Matrix"" turns out to have transpired in a totally false reality. Nobody expected these twists. What unexpected occurs in ""The Avengers""? Even its minor twists have appeared in other recent films. Its most significant--Loki allowing his own capture--comes straight from ""The Dark Knight.""Gangster films before ""The Godfather"" were just pulp. ""The Godfather"" transcended the genre just as ""Unforgiven"" did with Westerns. The same is true about ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Avengers"" doesn't transcend; it regurgitates a done-to-death plot. Unlike ""The Avengers,"" ""The Dark Knight"" was more than a comic book film. It was entertaining, compelling, yet it explored complex moral ideas, and its plot went in innovative directions. Did anyone know that ""The Dark Knight"" would end not with a fistfight but instead with a battle between the Joker and Batman for Harvey Dent's soul, a scene that leaves it open to interpretation whether the Joker or Batman really won in the end, a scene far more compelling than any sequence of destruction could ever be? And did anyone NOT know that ""The Avengers"" would end with a huge battle with the Avengers ultimately triumphant? Uncertainty about how a plot will be resolved is what once kept the audience hooked, not the continual spectacle of fights and explosions. In fact, look at the IMDb Top 250. With how many of these films would you know exactly how they'd end if you were seeing them for the first time? In fact, apart from the cartoons, is there a single entry as totally formulaic as ""The Avengers"" is? And let's not forget, did you ever worry that any of the Avengers would not survive? If not, then where was the real dramatic tension? One of the things that made ""The Dark Knight"" so compelling is that one of its two heroes not only dies but is also believably turned evil before he is killed. And did anyone expect what happened to Rachel Dawes, Harvey Dent's girlfriend? One of the things that made ""Psycho"" so dramatic is its main protagonist dies halfway through the film. Great films--serious or fun--must make the audience feel that there is something truly at stake. And do I even have to go into how voting to give ""The Avengers"" a 10 places it on par with the all-time great works of film art--""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Citizen Kane"", ""Vertigo,"" ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""8 1/2,"" ""Manhattan,"" ""Cinema Paradiso"" etc.? A vote of 10 for a film like this diminishes the worth of these works of art that explore the deepest issues concerning the human condition.Though I've brought up some films that are darker than ""The Avengers"" or more serious, that is not my complaint about ""The Avengers"" at all. ""Star Wars, "" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Back to the Future,"" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" were fun movies, but they also had plots that went in unexpected directions, had surprising twists, introduced us to unique characters. The elements I've listed here are what make a film exceptional and deserving of an incredibly high rating. Just a well-done totally formulaic movie like ""The Avengers"" simply does not deserve the praise it is getting. Of course this film does not deserve a 1 out of 10. I would really give it 3 or maybe 3 1/2 out of 5 stars, which is equivalent to a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the IMDb rating scale. However, until others don't alter their votes to put ""The Avengers"" more in line with where it should be in comparison to other great entertaining films of history, my vote will remain a 1. Go watch ""The Avengers"" a few more times. Once you've gotten used to the 3-D, the special effects, the digital surround sound, you'll see that the film is predictable, the jokes are so-so, and the violence of the fights and of the long climactic end battle actually gets kind of boring.If you're a teenager still reading comics or a lover of comic books who's always dreamed of watching Hulk fight Thor, Thor fight Iron Man, then this movie is what you've always been waiting for, but for the rest of us, ""The Avengers"" is not the tour de force it's been made out to be. Oh wait a sec. I just learned that there's a movie based on ""Battleship""--you know, that dull board game for eight-year-olds. I guess movies really are that bad. If you compare ""The Avengers"" only to garbage like that, I guess it really does seem great.Never mind...","1/10"
"The Avengers","liberalgems","11 May 2012","Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares, anyway? When Hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies, then where's the financial incentive to make decent films? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades (and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something) for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next,Dark Shadows; and now The Avengers!I am so sick and tired of New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, being attacked in the movies. Hello! It was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3,000+ real people, including my brother's co-worker, wife and unborn child! But what is really despicable is that at the very end of the The Avengers you briefly get to see a real-life news photo from 9/11 mourning the dead. That's just plain, disgusting exploitation! But lets not stop there! At the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local New York State Senator rant about how our Avenger heroes ""wrecked Manhattan."" That our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1,000+ ways are to ""blame"" for all the destruction! Fine! I agree many politicians are real jerks, but to put the letter ""D"" next to this Senator's name speaks volumes about the films real message: Democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful, winy creeps! That's real cute! I thought Hollywood was sooooooo liberal! If you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a ""R"" after the Senator's name? After all, the Republicans in Congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a Federally funded medical fund for First Responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic waste that was released into the air! The Avengers is also plain boring with the most two-dimensional characters in the history of film making! Sure I wanted the good guys to win! Sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty! But, really now, who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching Frosty The Snowman for the tenth time! The last third of the Avengers is nothing more than war porn! I will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from The Avengers as long as I live! Even for free, or if Hollywood offers me a million dollars! Overall, Hollywood has done a decent job with the X-men and the Fanatic Four, but for some reason the right-wing kooks who control the Avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine. No wonder why Stan Lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film! It's just too bad he and the rest of Hollywood has to stoop so low to make a buck!","10/10"
"The Avengers","phd_travel","28 July 2012","This is worth at watch but just once. The I wouldn't watch this again. Sure they spent a lot on effects and a grand battle scene at the end but throwing money at a movie doesn't help a weak story.This screenplay is weak - it is a overlong with has some rather strained dialog between the leads. The weakest thing about the story is why the evil guy wanted to wreak so much havoc without much reason. It just felt a bit contrived and isn't very involving. Don't feel for any of the characters.There is some wit and humor from Scarlett's deadpan Black Widow and Robert Downey's rather lame one liners. What happened to the charm of the old action hero movies?","9/10"
"The Avengers","higherall7","27 June 2012","Being at one time a young ten year old kid who cut his teeth on 'COWBOY SAM' books and 'JOHN HENRY AND THE DOUBLE-JOINTED STEAM DRILL' as well 'UNCLE ARTHUR'S BEDTIME STORIES', the adventures of the MARVEL UNIVERSE were a welcome introduction into what the older kids were reading and doing. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby somehow as though by divine guidance properly gauged the angst of those teenage years in the Sixties and the zeitgeist of that era. Before the Avengers battled the Space Phantom, I cannot remember when I ever encountered a Superhero like the Hulk. Basically he was a bully in diapers who did not play well with others. After the Avengers at last sent the Space Phantom back into limbo where he belonged, the Hulk related that his feelings were hurt by the remarks others made about him during the heat of battle. He gave the Avengers his walking papers and jumped off into parts unknown.This never would have happened in the JUSTICE LEAGUE.During the showing I attended, after the credits were done, there is a scene where the Avengers are sitting together in a restaurant eating. The expressions on their faces indicate that they would all rather be somewhere else. When I first saw it, it appeared a little non-sequitur and just something added-on to pique interest. But then I went to my Volume 1 of the ESSENTIAL AVENGERS which covers the first twenty four issues of their saga. I decided to use it as a reference for my remarks in this review. When I got to page two of Issue Two, there it was right at the bottom! Essentially the same scene that tagged the end of the Avengers movie. Oh, the setting was different as well as a couple of the characters present or absent, but the theme of the scene was identical to the movie. A bunch of misfits decide to get together and meet regularly in order to increase and better facilitate group cohesion and they can barely stand being in each other's presence! It's the American Experience reductio ad absurdum. It is also the Human Experience should you wish to wax philosophical about it.Reminds me of something I once heard Jesse Jackson declare during a speech and I believe he was quoting Martin Luther King; ""We have to learn to live together no matter how painful, or we'll die apart as fools."" Suffice it to say that for the Avengers working together and living together is particularly painful at times.No, Robert Downey Jr. would not have ordinarily come to mind as Tony Stark AKA IRON MAN, with his yuppie insouciance, but this is a new generation with its own issues and tastes, so there's no use asking ""-where have you gone Errol Flynn and Ronald Coleman?"". They're probably having lunch with Joe DiMaggio. Downey, in his own way, does more than represent with IRON MAN.Knowing this genre intimately and well, this time I may be too close to it to effectively evaluate it. There are all kinds of things in this movie that do not fit, but that's the glory of the Marvel Universe. It is a depot for all the things that do not fit that are somehow made to achieve this transcendent irreverent harmony, rhythm and balance. As Edward G. Robinson once said in THE CINCINNATI KID, ""-sort of like Life-"".Samuel L. Jackson has no real business being in the AVENGERS doing his usual scenery chewing, channeling bits of 'SHAFT' and 'HAWK' and the Black Man's angst about wanting in on the American Dream. For one thing, the original Nick Fury was a white World War Two hero who headed a squad called Sgt. Fury's Howling Commandos. He would probably be in his nineties by now, but only a time chosen few would know that. Besides, that's the beauty of this fantasy scenario. Nobody really questions what or who these super-powered characters are supposed to be avenging. Actually they're more like the FINAL GUARDIANS than AVENGERS. Anyway, you really would be missing the point pursuing this line of questioning. Here are all these odds and ends of personality and death-defying events and cultural themes somehow welded and soldered together in a kind of collage of imagination and experience and juvenile science fiction and it all works because in the end this ain't your universe. It's the MARVEL UNIVERSE and you're just living and thrilling in it. When you look at it that way, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury gets down and gets back, and redefines the American Dream as something more than that house with the little white picket fence and perhaps simply the divine right to be whatever you want to be.Joss Whedon and Zak Penn finally wised up and decided to stand on the shoulders of giants Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, instead of jumping off to do their own thing with the Marvel Universe. They have written a tale to celebrate. Joss Whedon's direction is Marvelouseque rather than a penetrating interpretation that sometimes hits and sometimes misses as in the case with Sam Rami's SPIDERMAN movies.Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Tom Huddleston as Loki, Scarlet Johansson as the Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, all have sufficient back stories now either through prior movies or the comics for the audience to be thoroughly prepared for what they might do. They are all so very nearly the characters themselves that all that's left is to be swept up in the action that is truly our satisfaction. And yet, the thing that makes the greatest impact in the end is the characters themselves.Welcome to the Marvel Age of Comics in Cinema!","9/10"
"The Avengers","sandnair87","21 April 2015","The Avengers is a clean-burning, six-cylinder entertainment - a wall-to-wall action bonanza, executed with a fluid coherence. It laughs in the face of expectation and instead sets its own bar that all blockbusters need to follow.Following on from the first Thor flick, the demi-god's evil brother Loki (a deliciously fiendish Tom Hiddleston) is intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an all-powerful energy cube that'll allow him to bring his alien armies to Earth. Trouble starts when this glowing cube of untold power called the Tesseract is appropriated by Loki, who with a nudge from his magic assegai brain-zaps a snap marksman Hawkeye (a competent Jeremy Renner) and a top scientist into his evil scheme of world domination. All that stands in his way is Nick Fury (the ever reliable Samuel Jackson), the head of the covert peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D. who sets about uniting the world's superheroes to avert the threat, rounding up our titular team - Iron Man (a hilarious Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (a subversively charming Mark Ruffalo), Thor (the charismatic Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (a sincere turn by Chris Evans) and Black Widow (the sexy but earnest Scarlett Johansson) ‚Äì hoping they will be greater than the sum of their parts. Problem is, they're a dysfunctional outfit, with differences of opinion and troubled pasts, and one of them is a gigantic, green loose cannon. Now, with a global catastrophe looming, they must subsume individual will to the collective good. But Loki isn't called 'the god of mischief' for nothing! Before Fury's new super team can find its balance, Loki is in their heads sowing seeds of doubt, distrust, anger and conflict. Can earth's mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet ‚Äì or is their coming together an even bigger threat than Loki himself?The Avengers doesn't buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast, largely because of Joss Whedon. He weaves all of the powder-keg moments into a story that is meaningful and always makes sense. The point in The Avengers is to bring six separate characters together as a team without sacrificing their individuality and by extension their value as solo franchises and Whedon does an excellent job of keeping the disparate personalities of his protagonists in play. Whedon's script sparks up the exposition with some sparkling dialogue, high stakes and balls- to-the-wall action spectacle. If you don't believe me, check out the thrilling alien-bashing finale on the streets of Manhattan - it is a pure fan boy wet-dream. Smart, funny, pulsating and surprisingly cathartic, Joss Whedon succeeds in appeasing its core fanbase. From ambition to scale to the way it justly balances each remarkable character, The Avengers is utterly stimulating, satisfyingly scripted and damn right faultless big screen entertainment. The Avengers make us do something increasingly rare in these over-franchised times - root for a sequel. Go smash!","10/10"
"The Avengers","A_Different_Drummer","27 January 2015","As a reviewer, I don't mess up often but, just like the line where Stark is ribbing Loki, sometimes even an IMDb top reviewer can have performance issues.My first view, I was annoyed that so much time was spent on backstory and it took an hour to get the ball rolling. Although in fairness once this story starts to move in the second hour, it MOVES.By my third viewing I could see the issue. I grew up with these characters and I had expectations. The expectations were incorrect, I now know, because those expectations were the reason the Marvel library was such a mess before the arrival of the Whedon Bros.So what Joss did was analyzed what was not working in past Marvel films then de-constructed the Avengers story, then build a film which could act as a base for future sequels, wit ha solid foundation.And wrote a script to die for. By the third time around I was actually listening to the film instead of just watching, and boy can that guy write.Like the line I posted as the title of this review. It took me 3 viewings to catch it. It is sly, it is sexual, and it is totally easy to overlook in all the action. But I was on the floor laughing.So there you go, it is fun, action packed (last hour), written at an Oscar level, the characters are perfectly cast (except the Nick Fury I grew up with was Caucasion, but I guess no one remembers) and, to keep the suits happy, not only made a bundle on its own but launched a new franchise.So that's a 10***********************************************ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLIND -- ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLINDJust watched this for the 8th time and want to update my review. As of this year (2017) this is, at the same time, one of the best ""action"" films in the history of the medium and one of the best scripts in the history of action films. I believe Joss received only one award for the screenplay, which is a pity, because it shows that the industry simply does not respect this genre. The little twists and turns that hold viewer attention like glue (""I'M ALWAYS ANGRY"" ""PUNY GOD"") are a Whedon trademark, and massively under-appreciated. I will also suggest that nothing with the Marvel brand that has arrived since Avengers I has been this good -- and I am including all their TV and other off-cable projects in that comment. The only flaw, and I mean the ONLY one, is that the close of this film sets an entire armada of ""politically correct"" followups having to do with the public blaming superheroes ... for being superheroes. Personally, as a superhero fan for over 60 years, I think that entire arc sucks and one day Marvel will figure that out. Otherwise perfect film!","6/10"
"The Avengers","movieman_kev","2 July 2012","Not much to say about this one that hasn't been said millions of times before. Brilliant comic-based movie that is, for me personally, the second best Marvel movie ever made, right behind Howard the Duck (kidding, kidding the first Iron Man film obviously). Joss Whedon further proves, as if any more evidence was needed, that as a writer/director he's amongst the top of his field. This is also the best Hulk film ever made and makes it more of a shame that the ball was dropped so badly in his own films. Bruce Banner is the stand out, but all the main superheroes have their very memorable moments, save for Hawkever whom is woefully underused and I hope his role is a tad flashed out on the upcoming extended cut.But really my minor gripes about the movie are few and far between. Loved this film.","10/10"
"The Avengers","paris_whitney_hilton_nyc","31 May 2012","When my friend asked me to see the Avengers with him I thought he meant the Steed and Mrs Peel Avengers . Unfortunately , it was the comic book Avengers . While I am not such a big superhero action movie fan , I did enjoy the Batman and Watchman movies . However, the Avengers is one film I could have easily passed up . After first battling each other , the Avengers unite and join forces to save the world from the same common enemy . A lot of the action takes place on a gigantic flying aircraft carrier ,No.64 ( not the CV-64 USS Constellation ). This movie consists mostly of very fast paced CGI's and cheesy Iron Man Robert Downey Jr one-liners . Our heroes and (super villain) are practically indestructible as they are beaten to a pulp but always manage to bounce back time after time . I don't know what the Black Widow's super powers were except martial arts and pistol shooting . Some unintentionally funny moments came when Iron Man Downey was speaking from inside his metal suit . It looked like a talking head from inside a goldfish bowl . It just looked so silly ! There isn't much chemistry between these cardboard characters either . If you are 10 years old or an adult with the maturity of a 14 year old boy , who is obsessed with reading comic books, and are addicted to video games, I'm sure the Avengers is your cup of tea . If not, you will be thinking of the 143 boring minutes you just wasted or what other movies were playing next door you could have seen . If you do decide to see this movie , select a seat in the last row to avoid nausea . I would like to see movies that rely so much on CGI's to be made into animated full length cartoons instead . At least the unaware movie goer has a better idea of what is in store for them when they purchase a ticket . This film was definitely not for me ! .... NOT HOT ... pwh","4/10"
"The Avengers","AlsExGal","5 April 2017","... but is the ultimate fan of Joss Whedon. I came to this film with virtually no background in the Marvelverse, so I was a bit confused at first. My husband helped fill in the blanks by stopping the film when I had questions, but I have to admit the script did a good job of filling in the blanks minus a few details. This is an excellent film of its genre that incorporates everything special effects can do today with great character development, courtesy of Joss Whedon who wrote and directed this blockbuster masterpiece. Do you know how rare it is to have blockbuster and masterpiece in the same sentence? He has to know that at some level that he, once again, did the impossible. He took what could have easily been a disaster and he produced gold. He created a movie that was fun, and exciting and shaped and brought cohesion to the Marvel Movie Universe and gave each character their time to shine. It has great acting; quippy dialogue; tons of very well done action; and a decent, if underplayed, level of ambiguity to the morality of the characters. They worked individually, they worked collectively. It had lots of Ultimate Alliance moments. Hulk shoves a piece of armor into the giant worm and Thor hammers it into his head, Thor brings his hammer down on Cap's shield and causes a huge shockwave, Thor shoots lightning at Iron Man and causes his suit to boost up to like 400+% giving him a supercharged shot. I love that all of those moments were added. I also love how Joss had a bunch of the heroes fight each other in a way that made sense in the context of the movie. Thor vs Hulk, Thor vs Cap, Thor Vs Iron Man, Hawkeye vs Black Widow, Black Widow vs Hulk. You can't help but love each and every fight. Will people still be talking about it 80 years from now the way they talk about Citizen Kane? Probably not. But Whedon accomplished in the 2010's in making a film in which I was completely engrossed for two and a half hours, had a wonderful and fun time and wondered where the time had gone when the credits rolled. And isn't that why we go to the movies in the first place?","8/10"
"The Avengers","dreamerboi23","14 April 2012","I just saw the early screening for San Diego through the top 10 cities on facebook who got them. And suffice to say I am glad I was privileged enough to.First off, this hands down is the best Marvel movie ever. I don't say that lightly. And in terms of superhero movie with maybe the Nolan Batman series being tied with this, I thought Whedon did an amazing job to bring out all these characters in this one movie. I especially like what was done with Hawkeye and Black Widow just because those two didn't really have their individual movie with their back story. You can tell when a comic book fan writes and directs a comic movie because it clearly showed in all areas of production for this film. Going into the film I honestly thought that a lot of the cool mutant action scenes would be strictly Iron Man and Captain America. But Whedon does such a great job giving each mutant their 15 mins of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like ""Wow this guy/chick is a badass"" for every mutant. I will admit i am not a Hulk fan. I like the inner story for it but was never a fan of the films, show or comic. But Hulk's role in the movie is so awesome I became a fan just from it. If any of you are Whedon fans then you guys/girls will love this movie. It has his M.O. written all over the humor and story presentation. And there were definitely parts in the movie where I thought ""Wow this seems like Firefly and Serenity"". And story aside, if you read, watched, or idolized Marvel superheros as a kid, the action alone will make you cheer just out of sheer nostalgia of imagining The Avengers or X-Men all together on the screen kicking ass. In summation, I don't need to say you NEED to watch this movie because I think anybody who is anybody already knows they want to see this. All this review has done was just reaffirm the hype behind this movie. I don't say this much but job well done Marvel and Disney for hiring a writer/director who has the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic fans who are the backbone of Marvel comics being a success. And in this day and age of superhero movies and movies in general that is very hard to do. Cheers Joss Whedon!","7/10"
"The Avengers","Michael_Elliott","15 May 2012","The Avengers (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Nick Fury brings together Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow to join forces and do battle against an enemy that threatens global security in this rather amazing comic book adaptation. I'll be honest and admit that comic book movies aren't my #1 type of film and it wasn't until just a month before THE AVENGERS opened that I bothered to check out the casts supporting movies. I enjoyed the two IRON MAN movies, thought THOR was very good, THE INCREDIBLE HULK was entertaining and I found CAPTAIN America to be decent but no matter what I felt about those films it couldn't prepare me for how much I enjoyed this one. Director Joss Whedon has created something incredibly special and you really can't help but think he's raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it. When bringing all of these characters together, the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasn't the case here as Whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it. The constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another. This banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great one-liners as well as some terrific action. When it comes to these type of movies I usually complain about a couple things. One is the obvious CGI but that wasn't a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it. Another thing I usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times. THE AVENGERS clocks in at 142-minutes, which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does. In fact, the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems. Say what you will about comic adaptations but there's no question that THE AVENGERS is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction, the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life. This here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up.","9/10"
"The Avengers","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","7 May 2012","For the past four years, Marvel Studios has been building a cinematic mythology based on their comic books, for the first time combining different franchises into a single canonical movie-universe. Starting in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"", to 2010's ""Iron Man 2"" and finally last year's ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"", there have been five films building in anticipation to this result- the ultimate crossover experience. In addition to those four heroes, we are also given Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury, bringing our team of heroes to about seven. (Although Fury isn't a direct player, so I suppose the team stands at six)This movie had a lot to live up to.It succeeded. By god, this was an awesome movie!Directed and co-written by Joss Whedon, 2012's ""The Avengers"" is perfect payoff for fans who have been anticipating this film for over four years now.Beginning with Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arriving at a SHIELD HQ, the Tesseract (the Asgard artifact used by Red Skull in last year's ""Captain America), which has been under lock-down for testing, opens a portal, allowing Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the outcast brother of Thor to arrive on Earth. He steals the Tesseract and uses his powers to brainwash several SHIELD members (including Hawkeye, portrayed by Jeremy Renner). It is revealed that Loki needs to the Tesseract to open a portal to allow an alien race to invade and conquer Earth.Realizing they are in over their heads, Fury calls out to unite the three Earthly heroes- Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans). After the team apprehends Loki, his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is sent back to Earth, completing our team.When Loki escapes and is finally able to open the portal, the four heroes (joined by Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow and a redeemed Hawkeye) must band together, despite their differences, to defend the world in an ultimate battle.The acting in this film is outstanding. This really begins with our four leads. There is no need to speak about Downey, he continues to play the role to perfection. Hemsworth and Evans also are given a lot of good material to work with. In particular Evans, who gives the character of Steve Rogers subtle pain and pathos this time around despite having to be strong. But the real revelation is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I thought both Eric Bana and Edward Norton had given fine, first-class performances. Particularly Norton, who really made the role his own in a big way. But Ruffalo surprisingly blows them both out of the water. He makes the role of Bruce Banner (and the Hulk thanks to motion-capture technology) his own, giving him humor and an incredible depth. Ruffalo is OWED his own Hulk movie now.In addition the supporting performances are incredible. The gorgeous Johansson is given a lot more to do in this film, and she breaths a great life into Black Widow. To be honest, Black Widow was at times more compelling than our four leads, and Johansson proves once again to be a phenomenal actress. Clark Gregg reprises his ""Iron Man"" and ""Thor"" role as SHIELD agent Phil Coulson, and provides some great comedic moments, in addition to being the shady government type. Hiddleston is menacing and dark as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard and Gwenyth Paltrow return in small roles as Erik Selvig and Pepper Potts, and although their scenes are minor, both ground the film emotionally. The only slight problem I had was with Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. I will say, he gave a fine performance, but his role seemed... somewhat underwritten in comparison with everyone else. He felt a little too expendable a character and shoe-horned in. But Renner was still good in the role.The script by Whedon (from a story he co-wrote with Zak Penn) is tight, concise and an absolute blast. There is a lot of humor (and I do mean a lot) and a ton of action, although it never feels forced, contrived or unneeded. As fantastical as the story is, it is grounded in it's own sort of reality and logic, and feels natural. This is an extremely well-written, fun and generally light-hearted film.The visuals are a blast. Whedon's direction and camera placement is fun, kinetic and serves as a good companion piece to the other four directors who had previously helmed the individual films. The effects are outstanding. The sound design is great. The score by Alan Silvestri is fun and memorable.This is just a competently made film, and a darned-fine piece of entertainment!I will say that this isn't necessarily the best film in the series (I think the first ""Iron Man"" felt a tad more fresh and unique), but this is still an absolute blast, and you cannot afford to miss it on the big screen!I give ""The Avengers"" a near-perfect 9 out of 10! Assemble in line at the cinema and see it, now!","10/10"
"The Avengers","sanddragon939","27 April 2012","From the moment Samuel L Jackson walked in during the post-credits scene of 'Iron Man' four years ago, talking about the 'Avengers Initiative', the whole world has waited for this epic assemblage of some of Marvel's greatest icons! Well, four years and five films later, the Avengers have finally assembled...and, as expected, it was with a wave of sheer awesomeness!Unlike the previous 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' films, 'The Avengers' isn't really into complex plotting here. The premise is simple-Loki, the Asgardian 'God', seeks to facilitate the invasion of Earth by an alien race...and Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD, responds by activating the 'Avengers Initiative', bringing together armored hero Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. reprising the character for the third time), Loki's 'brother' and Asgardian warrior Thor (Chris Helmsworth), the living legend and man out of time Captain America (Chris Evans), gamma radiations expert Dr. Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego the 'Hulk' (both played to perfection by Mark Ruffalo, following in the footsteps of Edward Norton) and clandestine operatives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). What follows is the usual hero vs. villain fare...albeit on a scale about a BILLION times larger than that of, say, 'Spiderman'. Indeed, one of the greatest moments in the film is a single shot that sweeps across New York City, taken in the battles of each of the six Avengers across the breadth of the Big Apple...a testament to the sheer scale and scope of not only the film itself, but the threat faced by the heroes in-universe.Action and spectacles aside, 'The Avengers' real strength lies in the characterizations of the core characters. Downey Jr. turns in another memorable performance as Tony Stark which was to be expected, and Tom Hiddleton brilliantly essays the megalomaniacal God Loki...but it is newcomer (to the Marvel movie-verse) Mark Ruffalo who really stands out in his dual performance as both scientific genius Bruce Banner and the rampaging Hulk. Ruffalo brings a level of depth to the character, and his inner struggles, which was not immediately evident in performances by previous actors. His Banner is not so much a man on the run from the monster within as he is a man who is starting to learn to accept the monster and use it as a force for good. Samuel L Jackson really gets to shine here as Nick Fury, after his cameos in previous films.On a parting note, there has been an unfortunate tendency, for months, on message boards, blogs and forums across the Internet, to create some kind of a 'competition' between The Avengers and Nolan's upcoming epic, The Dark Knight Rises. Having seen the former, I can safely say that such comparisons are totally uncalled for. The Avengers is not aiming to surpass The Dark Knight Rises any more than Star Wars was aiming to surpass The Godfather. They are two totally different films, belonging to different genres and (literally) whole different universes, and as fans, we need to respect that above all else and enjoy all masterpieces on their own merits!","9/10"
"The Avengers","OllieSuave-007","18 November 2013","This is an OK superhero flick featuring the Marvel Comics heroes Thor, Ironman, The Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. They are assigned to protect the entire globe from Loki, the stepbrother of Thor, and an alien invasion.There are plenty of enjoyable action is this movie, helped with some slapstick humor. The action sequences, especially during the climax, were breathtaking and exciting, leaving the audience thoroughly entertained. However, the movie's main plot and story aren't very captivating or compelling, coupled with lack of chemistry and substance between the cast of characters.I would like to have seen every superhero in this movie given a more elaborative purpose and equal screen time; it appeared that Ironman was the main focus of the movie and took away most of the glory - too much emphasis was placed on the character. Robert Downey Jr. was too cocky and tried too hard to be funny in the Ironman role.Overall, this movie is just one battle scene after the other. Not much of a story here, but it's something the kids would love to watch.Grade C","5/10"
"The Avengers","jon.h.ochiai","7 May 2012","Back on Earth through time and space, imperially arrogant god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) says, ""Freedom is the great lie¬Ö"" Thor's half brother will make the world his new kingdom. The brave souls, who stand in his path, are The Avengers. Director and Writer Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" convincingly assembles solo superheroes and super egos to battle Loki and his alien minions in one of the year's best movies. Think of Whedon as Coach Phil Jackson, but for superheroes. Robert Downey Jr. as brash Tony Stark threatens Norse god Loki, ""If we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it."" ""The Avengers"" is awesome.The classic hero story requires a commanding villain, and that is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston is charismatic evil and sympathetic sadness. He evokes certain pathos for Loki, feeling betrayed by his foil half brother Thor, strong and compassionate Chris Hemsworth. Thor fights with all his might against his brother, out of love and honor. Blond maned and shredded Hemsworth balances aloof charm and conviction as Thor. Whedon's ""The Avengers"" is timelessly inspiring: We believe in heroes who believe in themselves and others and would sacrifice their lives for the noble and just cause. I think the captivating leads of ""The Avengers"" are Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. Downey Jr. brilliantly hides beneath Iron Man's Tony Stark's cynical narcissistic veneer, a caring man wiser than his smart ass punch lines. Evans is surprising. Aside from looking amazingly chiseled he embodies in Steve Rogers (Captain America) a self doubting relevance, while the inspired leader emerges. His Rogers is the frozen super soldier who awakens 70 years later into a new war.The cool Stark and the solid Rogers clash passionately. Stark mourns a fallen friend. Rogers asks if this is the first time he has lost a soldier. Stark screams, ""We are not soldiers!"" Whedon and Zak Pen's story is kinetically driven, with the foundation laid in character. Powerful egos and intentions must coalesce and foster value and respect‚Äîas some sort of functional family tasked with saving the world.Whedon generates amazing performances, and infuses welcome wit and humor. To that end, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Director of the clandestine S.H.I.E.L.D., maybe the sinuous plot device. After making a career of cameos in previous Marvel superhero movies, Jackson fleshes out his bad ass Fury. He brings a refreshing gruff self awareness, after all The Avengers was his initiative so that these heroes would fight the fight we couldn't. However, is he the tough love patriot or calculated manipulator? Jackson cannily walks that fine line. Beautiful and idealist Cobie Smulders as loyal Agent Hill is Fury's social conscience. Stark, Rogers, and Dr. Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discern Fury's possible other motives shrouded in National Security.Exiled Loki brokers an alliance with the warrior alien race, the Chitauri. The Chitauri will let him rule Earth, if he brings them the Tesseract (Hyper Cube). The Tesseract harnesses the power of the galaxy, and is mysteriously tied to both Thor and Captain America. Loki uses the Tesseract to escape exile and breach S.H.I.E.L.D. Obtaining Tesseract, he brainwashes brave Agent Hawkeye (solid Jeremy Renner). Loki has a grand scheme. Expert straight man Clark Gregg as reliable Agent Coulson must call upon the team to protect the world. Scarlett Johansson is hot and deadly as Agent Natasha (Black Widow). She dispatches Russian mafia captors with Muay Thai and jujitsu in Jason Statham like style. She heads off to Calcutta to find Dr. Bruce Banner, and his raging green alter ego The Hulk. Ruffalo adds an understated brilliance and goofy charm that humanizes. We really believe that he has made his peace and controlled the ""other guy"". Coulson calls upon Stark (Downey Jr.), who is in the midst of clean power sourcing his Stark Tower. Stark has a playful relationship with his partner Pepper Potts (funny and beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow). Too bad Paltrow isn't leveraged more in ""The Avengers"".Of course assembling a bunch of super powered heroes is not immediate team building. Whedon orchestrates spectacular clashes amongst themselves. Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America battling in the dark forest is visually stunning. The Hulk taking on Thor is wild and strangely comical. The Hulk gets the prize for his cage match with evil Loki. The audience exploded in applause. Ruffalo is amazing. His casual nerd nicely bonds with Downey Jr.'s impatient genius. Renner as Hawkeye is solid and edgy, and plays nice. Johansson looks awesome in the black body suit. Even more impressive she shades the darkness and nobility of Natasha. She has a killer scene with Hiddleston at the story arc.""The Avengers"" delivers with the explosive visual spectacle as our heroes risk their lives battling the powerful aliens as they pulverize New York City. Whedon is masterful with the action and the characters. He makes us believe in heroes in ""The Avengers"".","10/10"
"The Avengers","BA_Harrison","21 April 2014","Having already starred in their own standalone movies, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, taking over the role from Edward Norton), Captain America (Chris Evans), and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) team up with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to form The Avengers, a team of superheroes-operating under the command of Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson)-who are called upon to battle evil Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) when he threatens to invade the planet with his Chitauri army.The Avengers made an absolute mint at the box-office, proving to me that a large percentage of cinema-goers aren't all that fussed about an innovative or intelligible script just so long as they get plenty of bang for their buck. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, The Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is an unnecessarily convoluted superhero blockbuster wrapped around the most tired of premises: an evil being seeking a mystical energy source that will give him the power to rule the world. This trite set-up allows for countless effects filled battles during which no-one suffers anything more than a bruised ego.An impressive line-up of Hollywood A-listers and the most spectacular state-of-the-art CGI effects money can buy do not alter the fact that this is predictable, clich√©d nonsense told with little style, coherence or originality.","6/10"
"The Avengers","chera_khalid","2 October 2023","The Avengers, a superhero symphony that had me fist-pumping like a Marvel fanatic. The ensemble cast, from Robert Downey Jr.'s snarky Tony Stark to Scarlett Johansson's kick-ass Black Widow, is a powerhouse of charisma and chemistry, each hero shining in their own right. The film editing is a whirlwind of action, seamlessly interweaving larger-than-life battles with character-driven moments that give the narrative heart. Strengths? The seamless blending of individual hero stories into a cohesive team dynamic, a superhero jigsaw puzzle that fits together flawlessly. Weaknesses? Occasionally, the plot might hover on the edge of over-the-top, but hey, it's a superhero extravaganza, and we love it that way. The music, Alan Silvestri's score, is the pulse of heroism, swelling with each iconic entrance and saving the world crescendo. Cinematography captures the grandeur of the Marvel universe, from the soaring heights of Stark Tower to the depths of Loki's mischief. The message? A celebration of teamwork, diversity, and the idea that even the most disparate heroes can come together for the greater good. 8/10 is a superhero salute to its exhilarating entertainment, a film that not only assembles Earth's mightiest heroes but also assembles a solid spot in the pantheon of superhero epics.","9/10"
"The Avengers","classicsoncall","5 May 2012","Well how do I put this across so it doesn't sound like I'm trying to trash the movie? I've been around since Stan Lee created Spider-Man, and some of the other Marvel super-heroes were around even before I was born. So I grew up at a time when the technology wasn't up to the task of putting what we see in today's Avengers on the big screen. With that said, it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak. The CGI and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle, so if that's what you're all about, you won't be disappointed. However if you're looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot, you've come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for. So on that score it works, but I need something more, even in a super-hero movie.With that out of the way, there were some genuinely funny moments in the picture that added the slightest dimension to the principal characters. Of all the players, Robert Downey Jr. probably brings the greatest sense of professionalism to his portrayal of Iron Man. He's out there, he's serious when he has to be, and he's a wise guy when the situation warrants. As for the the CGI Hulk - who ever thought he'd wind up being the comedic sidekick in a story like this? He had at least two stellar moments that brought my theater to life, the rag doll whipping on old Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and the sidearm swat to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that was so outrageous it just brought the house down.Apart from some of the witty comic book dialog, the rest was all relentless and gratuitously destructive special effects, exceptionally well done of course, but gosh, how much can a city take? Which by the way, is never dealt with as part of the aftermath of a super-hero barrage when a cosmic power like Loki comes to town. How about a film where citizen action groups bring charges against Iron Man, Thor and Hulk for destroying their city? Just kidding - how are you going to get them to court? Say, I know Stan Lee missed a cameo or two along the way in these Marvel flicks, so I was glad to see he showed up here, even though it was probably his quickest one ever. If you blinked you missed it during the cable news roundup following the final battle. It's going to be a sad day when Lee won't be around any more to make these appearances.And now for my final rant - as I write this, ""The Avengers"" has, in just two days, made it to #31 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Films. My post will be #495, so in less than a full weekend, movie goers have vaulted this film to a rating right up there in between ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this picture? Personally, if I were making the rules, I'd allow all the reviews in the world right out of the gate for a new release, but withhold ratings on a picture for at least a year or two after it's come out. OK, maybe six months. I think that would take some of the distortion out of the rating system, and someone like Joss Whedon wouldn't have to go around being embarrassed by comparisons to truly great films.Back to ""The Avengers"" - stick around for the closing credits for a preview of the next mind blowing Avengers flick. You know they'll be there because Nick Fury said so. THANOS!!! You think they can destroy more property than you saw done in this film? I'd bet on it.","10/10"
"The Avengers","Kane20","1 July 2012","I saw The Avengers on May 17. Personally, I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I quite enjoyed the movie. In my opinion, The Avengers is a pretty good and entertaining movie, and it's a good theatrical experience. James Berardinelli wrote in his review, ""The Avengers kicks ass."" I agree.Over the last few years, five movies have been made - Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and Captain America - which have built up to, and became prequels to, The Avengers. There were even things in those movies that hinted at them all being connected, and now this movie confirms it. The Avengers are all assembled in this film: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, the Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Yes, they're all played by the same actors, and they have the backgrounds that have been established for most of them in the ""prequels"" mentioned above. The villain in the movie is Loki, who was the villain in Thor, and who now plans on using the Tesseract, a powerful energy cube, to open a portal to another part of the universe and attack the earth with a powerful army. The Avengers are called together by Nick Fury, who runs an agency called S. H. I. E. L. D., and they must stop Loki from carrying out his plans. There's more to the story, but I won't give any more away.I'm sure there are things that can be criticized about the movie. However, it's really not worth it, given there are so many good things about the movie, and the entire experience is very enjoyable, so I'm not going to bother with an in-depth review/criticism. In a way, the film is sort of critic-proof (for lack of a better term). So here's my advice: don't dissect or overly analyze the movie. Just sit back and enjoy it. That's not to say that it's a total Transformers-like junk movie or anything. It's actually halfway decent.The actors put on a good performance and really bring out their characters, and the interactions between the characters are good - the gathering of the different superheroes is handled pretty well. The story is pretty solid, and it's coherent and appropriately paced. The visual and special effects and action scenes are great. Alan Silvestri composed an effective score for the movie. Overall, the movie is halfway decent, it's smart, and it's entertaining, and, unlike many junk films like Michael Bay's, it actually allows for sufficient blockbuster emotional involvement, and it has a good, wise balance between story and action/effects. The two-and-a-half hour running length of the movie pretty much zipped by for me. So, while I don't think this movie is great, it's definitely entertaining and worth seeing, and it's a very good theater experience.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)","9/10"
"The Avengers","prashanta_guha","7 May 2012","Let's be honest. All the previous Marvel films leading to the Avengers were great - story wise, acting wise, effect wise etc. Iron Man I & II, Thor, Captain America all turned out to be (surprise) box office hits, and one can see the point. So, when at the end of every movie, a post credits scene was shown depicting that there is something even greater planned, the expectations were raised pretty high.Joss Whedon (Firefly, Cabin in the Woods) took into account that set expectations, of both comic book fans and non-fans alike, and put together a superhero flick that'll rest proudly as the conclusion to its predecessors. The screenplay writers, the VFX studio, the actors (Robert Downey Jr. has always been my favorite) all deserve credit.An action packed, blockbuster movie that already has every record broken and every voice cheering, The Avengers is one of the best movies this year. A must watch, even if you're not into this stuff. 10 on 10.","1/10"
"The Avengers","snoozejonc","10 May 2021","Loki attempts to enslave planet Earth.This is an entertaining movie with impressive spectacle and solid character moments.The plot for me is okay, as Loki and the Chitari never truly feel like a plausible threat. However, the character time it gives to various superheroes is exceptionally good.Putting so many comic book characters on the stage at the same time is a difficult concept, but this is done well with some excellent dialogue and creative uses of their powers in various situations. Some of the banter from characters like Black Widow, Iron Man, Loki and Captain America is wonderfully written and delivered.There are some fights that feel a bit forced to bring fanboys fantasies like Thor v Ironman or Thor v Hulk to life. However, they are admittedly fun to watch. What does get a bit much is the sheer volume of hyperkinetic CGI heavy action sequences. They are fantastically designed but for me there is too much of it. Personally I would have replaced some of this with quieter character moments but this is just a matter of taste.It goes without saying that all the visuals are high quality throughout the film. My favourite sequence is the Stuttgart scene, which is beautifully filmed, edited, scored and climaxes with some heroic posturing from the Avengers.When the Hulk goes o the rampage in the Helicarrier, there is a brilliant scene transition from him punching someone through a wall to a shot of Iron Man emerging from a similar shaped hole in a different wall.The climactic battle scene is a massive piece of spectacle and it includes some of the most impressive effects and CGI sequences in recent years. At the risk of sounding like a killjoy, some of the impressive feats of heroism performed by the Avengers do seem like they have been included for the sake of coolness, such as no look shots and other solo moves.'The Avengers' contains a number of solid performances. For me Scarlet Johansson has the most powerful screen presence and Mark Ruffalo makes a perfect Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr is as charismatic as ever, whilst Chris Evans, Chris Hemswoth, Samuel L Jackson and Jeremy Renner are all solid. Tom Hiddleston is a lot of fun as Loki.For me it is an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.","2/10"
"The Avengers","tedg","10 June 2012","From time to time, I have the gift of unique movie audiences. I've watched ""The Brady Bunch"" in an after school audience of teen and preteen LA girls. Down the road from where I live is the Pat Robertson school of film where most students believe they are in a fight with the devil and film is a most powerful tool for Jesus, and I can feel that in the response to certain films. My home theater is in the midst of a significant military area, so I sit next to warriors and their families when wondering about the war movies I see. This includes the so-called seal team six, and all the navy pilots in the mideast.But the most precious of shared dark space is when I am in Shanghai. I saw this film there, the only nonasian in the crowd ‚Äî other than the 7 year old I was with. Then after a period of reflection, rewatched 'The Empire Strikes Back.'So I saw this film about the clash and merger of different worlds and dimensions while in full swim with that dynamic myself. (Chinese officials block access to IMDb, so this comment will be posted on my leaving.)The Star Wars films, the first of them anyway, demand only two extensions of the universe beyond a projection into the future. We assume that the future (or we did then) would include large machines, space travel and expanded notions of universal governance. There is no particular need to modify what we accept as the world we live in on that account. The notion of the force, and how it is woven into Jungian family dynamics was the big leap, the thing that forces us to stretch our universe. I think I understand the appeal of this across ages and cultures.The Marvel universe requires a different set of expansions. The time is now, yet we have world government and massive military machines and the same anachronistic limit on weapons. (There has been no advance in weapon technology: guns and swords.) We no longer need monsters to be designed to that actors can suit up, but even the CGI characters inherit this limit. But because they have to engage in hand-to-hand combat, we'll be asked only to assume beings more or less like us (but ugly) and big machines. They have the same notions of weapons (swords, guns, blasters) we have in both the real world and the cinematic sci-fi world.These limits ask little of us, but they limit the battles to be that same old crap we have seen hundreds of times before. The only thing Marvel could have brought was competence. Whelon does that.Where Marvel asks us to extend our universe is in the acceptance of complete, independent other worlds. These are not just different planets with the same physics, but different dimensions with (as much as the comic artists can imagine) different physics. This is a big assumption, and I suppose only a few enterprises (religious ones) can pull it off, because you have to take the space to define the different laws of the other dimensions.Marvel had a crew of different artists and writers, and they did not start out with a combined universe in mind, until a few managers until they combined several weak characters to sell more comics. (Stan Lee takes the credit for this, and I do not know the history well enough to dispute it.)So we have Tony Stark who really asks that we believe that the reach of technology will expand. We have several Marvel characters that also require only that we accept normal scientific accidents: radiation-based usually. The main disruptive device here is a crystal that asks only that we believe it emits some unknown radiation. This is only a cousin to the mysteries of the LHC. That takes care of Fury, Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. Hawk and Widow are just spies with extraordinary training (along the lines of Batman).Thor, Loki, Asgard and the creatures from yet a third dimension are what expands this. We are asked to believe in an open, manyworld universe. Not other planets (as with Superman). Not humanmastered magic (Harry Potter, the Jedi, Dr Strange), but other worlds. I credit Lewis Carroll with making this possible.Having said that, what Whelon does is allow the character interplay to be a reflection (that is, folded) commentary on these assumptions. Everyone among the 8 or so members of the team looks at and questions the worlds of the other. This is where the Chinese context comes in. I suppose in the US, Captain America is seen as partly a joke, what we shorthand as only a ""cartoon,"" but here that distinction is lost -- especially as the actor is encouraged to take his role seriously. Here, what we have is Team America taken seriously.What is seen here ‚Äî and the China market for Hollywood blockbusters is as large as the US market ‚Äî is a dull-witted, good-hearted American soldier taking command. He is manipulated by the government and military leaders, and supplied with the most extraordinary technology. He even ‚Äî and no one should be surprised by this ‚Äî has access to the powers of the other worlds. The blond hair and Germanic manner really stand out here.Oh and the redheaded girl, with the spotty past, guile and commitment to do good.I have no idea what effect this will have on global audiences. The Marvel franchise is now as powerful as that of Star Wars and Potter, and much more able to be mapped to current events. Fury even references them. But I can tell you that this was a thrilling experience, to see this with the additional fold of the audience, some of whom looked away from me when leaving the theater.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","1/10"
"The Avengers","Uriah43","24 December 2013","This is one of those movies that has both good points and bad points. For starters, I thought ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) and ""the Hulk"" (Mark Ruffalo) were absolutely sensational. Likewise, most of the other characters were well played too. On the flip-side though the introduction of ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) was terribly planned and presented. Not only was the character development badly mishandled but the fact that this person got so much screen time when there were others with much better credentials just boggles the mind. Not only that but his costume-or basic lack thereof-also stuck out like a sore thumb. Additionally, although I liked the CGI I thought it and the non-stop action were just too overwhelming. Even more important was the fact that there were too many characters and not enough film to go around between them. This made the film look extremely uneven. Too many cooks do indeed spoil the soup. Be that as it may, this movie should have been very good but in all frankness it turned out to be a jumbled mess. All things considered then I think the really good points were dragged down by the lack of direction which resulted in a very mediocre film. Accordingly, I rate it as only average.","1/10"
"The Avengers","emily-k-mccole","15 April 2012","I was lucky enough to be included in the group to see the advanced screening in Melbourne on the 15th of April, 2012. And, firstly, I need to say a big thank-you to Disney and Marvel Studios.Now, the film... how can I even begin to explain how I feel about this film? It is, as the title of this review says a 'comic book triumph'. I went into the film with very, very high expectations and I was not disappointed.Seeing Joss Whedon's direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor. The special effects are literally mind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and beautifully choreographed.While all of these things (script, action, special effects and so on and so forth) are important... it's no good having them spot on if you don't have a cast that just isn't right. But fortunately, for fans and for the actors involved, Whedon's cast not only work brilliantly together but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and threatening each other all day and night.The actors' performances in ""Marvel's The Avengers"" are simply captivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert Downey Jr. will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations. And Tom Hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear.All in all, Marvel's The Avengers is a visual delight and I cannot wait to see it again, and again, and again. Marvel fans will not be disappointed, and something tells me that most of you will agree with me wholeheartedly.The Avengers, assembled and awe-inspiring. Ten out of ten.","9/10"
"The Avengers","artful_mark","4 May 2012","Ugh! ""Avengers"" wore me out. Lets begin with this spoilfest review. The character I was most looking forward to being fleshed out was Hawkeye, who starts out as a zombie.... Loki has a good entrance, but his alien-buddies are never fleshed out, named, or given any character development whatsoever. Apparently, their ""advance warfare"" includes just really-drunken aerial driving. Thor was a pure letdown. He had no swagger, wasn't boisterous, and his costume changed without rhyme or reason. PLUS, he just *poof* appeared, and this killed the beautiful and tragic unrequited love ending of ""THOR"". PLUS, PLUS, he didn't even try to find Jane, or even pound her with a hailstorm or anything! Maria Hill was just annoying eye-candy whose stunning visage countered her lack of plot-points. And Captain America was lackluster. Black Widow was okay. Hulk was funny, but it was kind of creepy how he went after Black Widow. He spends half the movie telling everyone not to bring out the bad guy, then he kind of reveals in the movies silliest moment that, oh, golly gee, I can do this anytime I want to. And Pepper Potts as a daisy-duke wearing penthouse babe? I don't think so. The worst continuity of the series fell on Iron Man. At the end of ""The Incredible Hulk"", it was setup where Tony Stark was forming the Avengers, then we find out in ""The Avengers"" that he wouldn't even be accepted? No Odin, No Jane, No tender flashback scene for Cap's love-interest... I felt the movie really could have benefited from some roller-coaster ride, instead of all peaks. I was surprised to see ""Jenny Agutter"" listed in the credits, apparently she was an unnamed council-member who was so poorly lit she didn't stand out. The best part was Agent Coulson who died (wtf?). And who was the rogue pilot who took it upon himself to nuke New York? No hints at future teammates.... No real philosophic underpinnings like X-Men had... It was kind of just DisneyWorld on Crack, but it was fun to see on opening night....","10/10"
"The Avengers","martinpersson97","20 August 2021","The MCU had estavlished itself as an interesting project since the start - there were some hit and miss movies, but it was overall an imaginative concept.Then came the moment everyone had been waiting for, the big culminatiom that had been promised for years - and with Joss Wheadon at the helms, it sure doesn't disappoint.Like the MCU overall, it has a very fun and lighthearted feeling reminiscent of films like Str Wars, which is much appreciated. It is a very colourful cast of different and memorable characters, all memorized by great actors. The main antagonist Loki establishes himself as one of the most interesting and complex movie villains of all time, whether he's tragic, spiteful, mildly heroic or just pure evil, he's a joy to watch.A main draw in these movies, of course, are the effects and action scenes and they sure doesn't disappoint. The movie gives us some of the biggest and most epic scale battles ever seen on the silver screen, and it's simply mind blowing. The cinematography is incredible as well.Overall, a fun and epic movie that was years in the making and once and for all proved how successful the Marvel Cinematic Universe was.","3/10"
"The Avengers","j-pryde","25 April 2012","Although Marvel Pictures have always made curious appointments in regards to their feature film directors the results have been mostly solid, if not spectacular thus far. I certainly didn't expect Jon Faverau to deliver one of the best comic-book movies ever ‚Äì Iron Man. If it wasn't for DC's own Billionaire playboy superhero would've champion Iron Man as the best flick in the genre. Yes I do rate Iron Man that highly. Spider-Man 1 & 2 were good but didn't exactly capture the essence of Peter Parker while Spider-Man 3 was a huge mess, not Mark Steven Johnson mess, but a mess nonetheless. Last year's motion picture debuts of Marvel staples Thor and Captain America were also very good, very faithful to their respective source material. Joe Johnston redeemed himself after a misguided attempt at bringing the Wolfman back to the silver screen, whereas Kenneth Branaghs Shakespeare sensitive's proved a stroke of genius in fitting Thor into Marvel's motion picture universe. To be honest I even enjoyed 2008's The Incredible Hulk after Ang Lee damn near killed the franchise.Even though Marvel Pictures has proved time and again to make the right decisions when producing a movie on its own, the hiring of Joss Whedon seemed like an odd choice. Of course Joss Whedon is the genius behind TV-cult hits like Buffy, Angel and Firefly but his only foray into directing was 2005's Serenity. Managing all those superstar egos, handling multiple character arcs, dealing with several multimillion dollar franchises and making everyone happy from top brass executive down to the hardcore fanboys ‚Äì to be honest, I wouldn't have entrusted him with a fraction of the $200-million-plus budget for The Avengers. Thus far only two directors have managed to pull off the impossible and accomodated several superheroes in a single movie ‚Äì Bryan Singer (X-Men & X2) and Matthew Vaughn (X-Men First Class) while Brett Ratner ruined X-Men 3 with his unfocused direction. At first I thought Joss Whedon would do an even more terrible job than the latter, considering that Ratner had more filmmaking experience than Whedon at the time of filming X3. But nothing could be further from the truth. Joss Whedon is the MASTER, with a captial M.Let me say it out loud: JOSS WHEDON IS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE GOD. Unlike Ratner he actually cares about the characters and their development throughout the movie. You think Tony Stark would just waltz through the movie and roll over every other character? You are wrong. Though Robert Downey Jr. is in top form as he always is when he dons the Iron Man suit, the other characters are far from underdeveloped and don't crumble under the pressure of his larger-than-life persona. If anything it's the Hulk that absolutely steals the show. That said, I think we have found the definitive Bruce Banner, Mark Ruffalo, he absolutely owns the role. He is the Hulk and we finally got the Hulk we deserved. Everybody brings their A-game and every character gets a fair amount of screen time. I can't find any flaw in this movie. Of course the special effects are spectacular but it's the dialogue that won me over. Really. Each character in this movie has at least one or two memorable lines ‚Äì not just Tony Stark. When you watch the Avengers make sure you listen to the dialogue carefully ‚Äì I've never heard dialogue this witty in any comic movie, and I've watched my fair share. Joss Whedon you are the freaking man. They said it was impossible to accommodate this many characters in a single movie ‚Äì they were wrong. From now on everyone will reference this movie whenever multiple larger-than-life figures are thrown into one supersized extravaganza ‚Äì Yeah I'm slamming the last two Transformers flicks. I guarantee Joss Whedon would've done justice to the franchise. After watching the Avengers everything that bears the name of Joss Whedon is a must-see for me now. Final verdict: 10 out of 10. This movie is Iron Man on steroids. Go watch that movie!!!","1/10"

"The Avengers","unbekannternutzer","21 August 2012","this is where IMDb needs to react to all those obviously faked reviews. if they don't people will just ignore all 'blockbuster'-reviews. which would call for competition that will take action against this kind of manipulation.this has never been so obvious than with the avengers. this movie does not deserve a rating above 4. the plot is uninspired and boring, has no twists and everyone knows where it's going. the dialog feels very scripted. characters in comic books for 5-year-olds maybe talk like that. superheroes don't. the acting is very unnatural, it feels very staged and no emotion is being transported to the audience. the characters aren't developed, they just get different punchlines to throw at the audience. the cgi is really bad, not worthy of a movie of 2012. i think even '2001 - A Space Odyssey' (1968) had better special effects.it seems that they spent almost all their money on the actors, forgot about the story and just used the cheapest cgi they could get. the rest of the money they used for marketing and creating a hype (as i said, this is obvious here on IMDb).the whole thing is just cheap. but we will see more of this if people continue to make this kind of movie profitable. and this will probably be the case, so expect more of these.","10/10"
"The Avengers","hendry-robert","27 January 2013","Honestly, I like the odd superhero movie but the makers of this are like the fat kid in Willy The Wonka who has to have all the chocolate. This production (sic) treats the entire audience as low IQ zombies (no offence to actual zombies intended). There is zero depth of character development and zero story line interest. At no time whatsoever do you ever feel a sense of suspense or danger. At no time do you care if any of the characters come to harm - well you kind of know that none of them will as their superheroes - obviously. And why even bother having humans with no super powers - Oh I forgot, the humans in it are the most magical, unbelievable fighting machines. They just stand there wasting anything in their path, and Im not talking about the super heroes here. Rambo is but a beginner compared to them.Every single facet of this farce is totally predictable from start to finish. Its one of those where you pray your transported to another reality and the bad guys actually win.Technically its all good except the sound department have again gone mental. The action scenes are incredibly loud and were at times quite painful on the ears (seriously) and then the speaking parts were often so whispered and muffled sounding. I'm sure during post the sound guys sit there with the best sound system money can buy - but the reality is their mix doesn't translate well across systems. Bad sound isn't the problem, its the post mixing. I hear this issue on far to many movies these days and its ruining many films.The acting by some of the cast is decent, considering the ridiculously poor script they have to work with. But in no way will any of them be remembering their part in this movie during their twilight years. This is a money and profile job - nothing more. Even then I do have to wonder if putting your name to this is actually worth it?. The directing is amateur hour. His/her (I don't know and don't care) focus is squarely on action and FX - so why not just have the FX team direct it as they certainly would have done a better job than the lucky ducky who managed to land this lucrative job. I do wonder if the director has actually ever watched a movie to see how one directs actors?Anyway, I cant say much more about this nonsense except if you enjoy a movie which is one long mind numbing boring action scene, aimed at a dumbed down populace - then this is for you.PS I cannot believe this movie gained so much favourable reviews. I certainly smell a rat.","1/10"
"The Avengers","frankdistefano","13 June 2012","What a disappointment, although really not surprised at how bad it was. A totally boring, endless and mostly witless movie aimed at brain-deadened people who think that special effects, explosions and fantasy but definitely not fantastic characters make for a great movie. The cinematography was gray and cloudy, the editing incomprehensible, and the acting unsurprising and depressingly familiar. Simple, human emotions, which used to be integral to a movie are now so rare. Noise and all-too-familiar mayhem have been substituted. The attention span of the audience, when not being bombarded by yet another special effect, shifts quickly to their cell phone when things slow down even a bit. To think that more-of-the-same will be the order of the day is depressing. Count me out.","5/10"
"The Avengers","pro-wows","11 May 2012","There is no way this is legit 8.8. The movie is comparable to Transformers 3.(Rated a 6).Look I loved the following recent action hero movies. Spiderman (1-3), Dark Knight, Super 8, Iron Man(1-2), Transformers(1-2)I really don't dislike that many movies. I'm not being cynical. This movie really is just a cluster ..... There's no emotion to the whole thing. Its dull and flat. It also feels very ""PG""Its the definition of clich√© when it comes to super hero movies. There's no bar being raised, there is nothing new being done. The entire script is just a bunch of predictable non sense jargon with no meaning. There's no event in the movie where i go wow, that is original. Or go wow this movie gives me emotion and it really immerses me in the experience(Watch the beginning of star trek).My only thoughts is that Walt Disney Pictures did black hat tactics to hype this movie through social networks. I cannot and will not believe people think this movie is worth an 8.8.I really did want to walk out of the theater. This movie is forgettable and I was very disappointed and let down. This movie really just feels like another ""average"" super hero movie. But the expectation of it being good just makes it worse.","4/10"

"The Avengers","rachel-673-19946","27 April 2012","This, friends, is the comic book movie that all other comic book movies wish they could be. It's the pinnacle, the ultimate, the surely unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre, a grand adventure full of humor, action, tension, fan service and an undeniable pathos. For anyone fearing that all the hype ‚Äì years and years worth of hype ‚Äì might cheapen or otherwise overshadow the final outcome, you may at last be at ease. Because the JOSS WHEDON! AVENGERS MOVIE! is exactly as good as we all hoped it could be.Maybe even better.The Avengers, of course, are a superhero team made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Other heroes have come and gone amongst this happy few, in comic form, but here all you need to know is that this film serves as kind of a sequel to previous Marvel movies IRON MAN(both 1 and 2), THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America, bringing the billionaire Tony Stark, the scientist Bruce Banner, the demigod Thor and the recently defrosted World War II veteran Steve Rogers together to fight against an invading alien threat, alongside spies Clint Barton (Jeremy Denner) and Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) and under the auspices of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.Man, it's awesome. AWE. SOME.Oh, it's by no means a perfect film. Whedon is perhaps just a shade too in love with S.H.I.E.L.D technology, and the weight of portent which is given to some truly innocuous lines ‚Äì especially the final line ‚Äì feels a little off-kilter. Flashing up a computer image of Natalie Portman's Jane (Thor's love interest from his movie) felt a little like an apology, and the shadowy government hacks who attempt to control Nick Fury are by-the-numbers backroom power players of the Cigarette Smoking Man-school, ruthless and annoyingly clich√©.Everything else, though? Simply, outstandingly, without a shadow of a doubt incredible.Just for fun, let's talk acting. All our returning superheroes reprise their roles with ease, Downey Jr. once again a delight as the arrogant billionaire Stark and Evans stoic and earnest as the displaced Cap. The award for Most Improved has to go to Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor is given a chance to rock some deadpan wit here, and rock it he surprisingly does. Johansson, of course, is gorgeous and ass-kicking as ever in her Black Widow leather, but is happily also given new levels of intriguing backstory at which to hint and play out, and her friend Hawkeye is given somewhat more to do here than he was allowed in Thor, Jeremy Renner's relaxed performance once again worthy of my beloved marksman's bow and arrow. Clark Gregg's mild-mannered Agent Coulson is adorable in his hero worship; meanwhile our main antagonist in this film is Loki, Thor's resentful trickster brother once again played with consummate creepy cool by Tom Hiddleston.Oh, and hello again Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts! Aren't you funny and great?Of the newcomers, I will admit to having had some reservations about Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, as I had been a true devotee of Edward Norton's turn in the role, but I am big enough to admit when I am wrong: he was terrific here as the mousey, mild-mannered science guy with a chip on his shoulder, and the uses to which his Hulk was put throughout the course of this movie have almost entirely changed my mind about his place in the Marvel Universe. It was that good. Elsewhere, How I Met Your Mother's Cobie Smulders, as an agent of S. H. I. E. L. D., did a lot with a little ‚Äì enough to hope we see more of her lithe and loyal lieutenant character in AVENGERS 2.Indeed, after a rollicking, outrageous, hilarious outing like this one, who wouldn't already be eagerly awaiting a sequel? It is, unequivocally, the best comic book movie I have ever seen (and I've seen, well, all of them). More than that, it is my favorite movie so far this year ‚Äì whew! I was so hoping BATTLESHIP wouldn't continue to hold that title for too much longer ‚Äì and one I cannot wait to see again.Avengers assemble, they say? Audience assemble, I say! And assemble, and assemble, and assemble again¬Ö(And make sure you stay through the credits for the now-expected next-movie teaser¬Ö Buffy and Angel fans will be particularly happy, even if they don't quite get the somewhat obscure comic-y reference¬Ö)-- This review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine - www.geekspeakmagazine.com","10/10"
"The Avengers","poe426","1 October 2012","Without a doubt, THE AVENGERS is the most expensive video game ever produced; why the techs would want to try to integrate live-action elements, however, is beyond me: the cartoon was okay without them. Robert Downey has the best lines (half a dozen one-liners, to be precise), though Thor's contention that Loki ""was adopted"" was just as funny. Sam Jackson looks just plain bored throughout- which is saying a lot when one considers the fact that he's the most overrated actor in Hollywood. You know a movie's heavily padded when fully one-third of it could be cut and never missed: the first third of this game is mind-numbingly clich√©d and plays out like yet another pseudo-military video game (what used to be called ""first-person shooter"" games but are nowadays referred to as ""first-person action"" games) or television show the likes of which we've seen a thousand times. The skrull at the end was a nice little touch, but I wonder why comics- and now their celluloid incarnations- tend to focus on alien invasions for their ""big get-togethers"" when there are more than enough wannabe tyrants here on Earth...? I think John Carpenter (THEY LIVE) and George Romero (LAND OF THE DEAD) had it right: we have seen The Enemy, and He is Us. Give me RODNEY CECIL, PSYCHO HERO any day.","10/10"

If you take away all the eye-candy, this movie would be less than 15 minutes long - major flunk, imo. This is a movie to forget about.

"The Avengers","Squaremaster316","24 April 2016","*Spoilers*Just when Comic book films were truly starting to enjoy a time of true artistic relevance and seemed to be on the verge of officially casting off the shackles of stereotypes and bias that have plagued the genre for decades, along comes a film to firmly entrench it in every single hackneyed clich√© and trope that have been the deservedly derided by the educated community.The Avengers is, by far, the most uninspired CBM story I've seen from the CBM genre to date, disguised by draping a cheap, easily exploitable crossover gimmick over it, not so dissimilar to the various other poorly conceived amalgamations that have been presented to us over the years in various mediums (Cartoon All Stars, AVP, Freddy v Jason, and, most recently, Dawn of Justice).Poorly executed, nonsensical characterization (""i'm Always Angry"", basically the 2012 version of ""Your mother's name is Martha too?""), forced interactions and stock 'argument' dialogue (We're not a team, we're a time bomb."", subtle.), and a total lack of dramatic heft give a very light (story-wise, not tone), one-note, TV episodic feeling to what should have been a complex, multi- layered epic.Overall, a conglomeration of ""fanboy"" moments vainly stitched together to attempt some sort of narrative.","4/10"
"The Avengers","sacflyzone","16 April 2012","Yep, Marvel has done it again but this time to the max! You can rest assured that Avengers is an absolutely amazing movie. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. (Sony pooping on Ghost Rider again this very year is a great reminder of that) Avengers is, without a doubt, their best effort yet! Personally, I think they set the bar leading up to this movie and they just clean blew the bar in to orbit with this movie.Avengers really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. They along with a select few others reinvented epic adventure as this century began by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Nolan did this for Batman and Raimi for Spider-Man. They pulled it off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them. Favreau, Branagh and Johnston did similar good work for Marvel leading up to this gem. Now, Joss Whedon not only continues that tone but adds to the work that's come before. It's like the ultimate team work and Whedon brings it all home and all together perfectly. Like the great films of the past, he grounds the action and the superhero concept in firm reality. The humor and acknowledging the absurd nature of everything we see adds the perfect flavor. Yet, all the character depth and relationship nuances are fleshed out well as with any other good film.I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Avengers delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt one of my top 10 movies of 2012, quite possibly THE best regardless of genre. I don't see anything changing that for the rest of the year. This movie is just that good","10/10"

"The Avengers","DarthVoorhees","29 May 2012","'The Avengers' is a brilliant cartoon with tremendous flair, style, and more than it's share of silliness. Director Joss Whedon is allowed free reign to present a massive spectacle of action and destruction and it is often very visually spectacular and often more than fun. Is 'The Avengers' the comic book masterpiece awaited for years by geeks everywhere? No. It isn't even Marvel's best offering as an independent studio. The only level 'The Avengers' really succeeds on is being a huge cartoon. It offers nothing truly unique in realm of dealing with these characters or their mythology. If the modern day comic book is a romanticized colorful dissection of hero worship and good and evil as I and a great many comic book fans like to think it is than Joss Whedon has ultimately failed in respecting that and using it to give his audiences something to chew on. In a great many ways I found myself brought back to the horrendous experience last summer of watching another huge action spectacle, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'. 'The Avengers' is in many ways the same movie, neither have any sense of stakes other than to make sequels. Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor are here to sell toys and tickets.Epicness is what is on the table in this film and Joss Whedon surely does deliver an epic action packed film. Delivering an action packed film isn't all that hard to do though. There are no stakes to 'The Avengers'. Missing is a sense of dread and threat. I wanted our heroes to really be tested by something bigger than themselves and they aren't. I sing the praises of Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' and you know what Jon Favreau's first 'Iron Man' film because they truly brought our characters to a point where they had to question what made them heroes and if being a hero was more than just paraphernalia. Both films created tremendously strong villains which served as representations of all that could be corrupted and made evil within the title heroes. The threat in 'The Avengers' comes in the form of a pretty lame mcguffin. We find out next to nothing about the tesseract cube other than it can blow stuff up in a Michael Bay-esque fashion. The threat to our heroes is pretty dull and lackluster. Often our heroes have to spend time reminding us they are saving the world because we forget. I wanted to be reminded that our heroes bleed and can die. Kill off a sacrificial lamb and keep me interested. (I know the retort here about Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson and he is a very fun character but he merely serves as a second rate sidekick)I think every actor in here is having a blast in their roles and I love seeing it. I don't necessarily think they are all taking their roles seriously but I do think they are engaging all the great things that make these characters pulp icons. My favorite performance has to be Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Loki isn't all that rounded a villain or character but Hiddleston loves the comic book nature of the character. Saying you want to take over the world often is a silly empty threat and yet if someone says it the right way it is fun.The final battle scene is grand as promised. Is it fun? Yes. That is something I do want to reiterate because the film is fun. There is something to be said about enjoying eye candy and things blowing up. 'The Avengers' is a masterpiece if that is what we are concerned with. Does the battle go on too long? I didn't check my watch nearly as much as I did during 'Dark of the Moon' but yes it is drawn out. I think I wouldn't feel this way though had the problems mentioned earlier been addressed. The chitauri are just plot pieces and even though we see our heroes take some hits never do we see any real toil this has on them. What is 'The Avengers'? A cartoon. The kid in me was satisfied with all the action but the adult in me wanted more.I think with 'The Avengers' we have a cinematic Rorschach with everyone getting something they want out of it and rating it much higher than it truly deserves. I saw it opening weekend and have pondered over it amidst the fanfare. Is it a good film? Yes, if you hold it up as a summer blockbuster it is an exceptional fun filled ride. Is it a substantive film? No, if you want a substantive comic book film than see 'The Dark Knight' or 'Iron Man'.","9/10"
"The Avengers","brefane","9 June 2012","Loud and overlong with minimal character and plot development and casual banter among the characters that feels more like a run through. Likewise, the conflict and plot don't really seem to matter, and there is no tension, suspense or pacing. Each scene is on same level as the one before; you could watch this film with the scenes arranged in virtually any order. This thing totally lacks momentum. The expensive cast does well enough, but the film's length and one-dimensional plot grows tiresome and the noisy soundtrack seems designed to prevent dozing. The Avengers is not particularly recommendable, nothing about it is memorable or original and it's not a film I feel any need to revisit. It's a passable time killer; nothing more.","9/10"

The movie gives each character a good amount of screen time and makes you care for them and be interested to watch them grow and succeed. The villain is also amazing as he is extremely funny and very clever by using each avengers weakness against them and the team making the team fight each other causing good action and good story telling.

"The Avengers","darkraven_109","28 April 2012","I can not say anything more about THE AVENGERS; the movie just hit all the right spots and a lot more. It didn't only entertain like how a brainless popcorn movie would; it told a great superhero team story.The characters were written perfectly, the action was spectacular and best of all ever character was a joy to watch. The story had the perfect balance of comedy, action and drama (yes, there's a bit of that too and it's good). It's everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movie.Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got the right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like ""IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,"" your fears will be washed away. Mark Ruffalo also stole the show as Banner/ The Hulk; if you had a few doubts about him playing the character after Edward Norton was left behind, fear not since he does the job well. I can go as far as saying that Ruffalo is the best incarnation of Banner so far. Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation. He created what I consider the best superhero movie so far. He made THE AVENGERS.To say anything more would be a waste of time. Just go and watch it.","10/10"
"The Avengers","grantss","28 August 2015","Your typical modern action movie: all style, no substance. Plot is close to non-existent, or, at least, incomprehensible. Very jumbled, entirely because the writers wanted to somehow meld all the individual Avenger stories into one story. Makes for a contrived mess.As expected, the special effects and action sequences are good. Hard to compliment performances in an action movie, as there is very little real acting involved. However, Robert Downey Jr puts in a show- stealing performance.On the whole, vastly over-rated (and this is probably a sign of how dumbed-down the general population is with regard to expectations for movies). The only positive thing I can say is: it's better than Transformers, but that says very little.","5/10"
"The Avengers","tareqzaghal","2 September 2023","Probably the most important blockbuster of the 21st century so far. This generation's Star Wars (1977). A cultural landmark that proved individual stories serving a unifying purpose can be told within a cinematic universe, a feat that many studios have tried to replicate but failed, and something that the MCU struggles with today.The biggest challenge that The Avengers (2012) would face is having to balance the immense stardom that comes with the previous five films, which all lead up to this moment. A moment that would make or break the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the moment when six individual and leading multi-layered superhero characters would share the silver screen together for the first time.What makes this film work so well is Joss Whedon's screenplay, a highlight of the film that respects and values each character, their motivations, and their overall arcs. Even all the jokes, iconic lines, and quips feel organic and true to each persona. The lab scene where all the main characters present argue and clash over different things beautifully captures the perfect synergy between the different characters. It's my favourite scene in the film and probably the most well-written one in the MCU, which establishes so much in so little time.From a technical aspect, the visual effects are still as remarkable as they were ten years ago when I first saw the film. Hulk's design is drastically improved from his stand-alone feature and is my favourite incarnation of the character in the MCU. Stark's suits always look incredible and it's a shame that in Infinity War and Endgame, they are less practical and just worse. Captain America's suit is goofy as hell, and overall, the other visuals or designs do not stand out, but the film does choose to take a safe, bright, well-light approach to its cinematography and aesthetic, instead of a specific look.There's nothing I don't like about the film, and there's undoubtedly a lot of nostalgia packed into it at this point, but it always feels fresh and exciting whenever I see any scene. The one shot during the battle of New York is one of the most glorious comic book film moments ever. You just can't not have fun with this film.","10/10"

The movie follows these superheroes as they come together to save the world from an alien invasion led by the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston).One of the strongest aspects of the movie is the chemistry between the cast.

The movie does a great job of juggling its large ensemble cast, giving each character their own moment to shine while also moving the overall plot forward.The direction by Whedon is confident and assured, with a strong visual style and a keen sense of pacing. The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is also impressive, with a mix of handheld shots and steady compositions that give the film a sense of energy and momentum.The musical score by Alan Silvestri is a standout, with a memorable main theme and well-placed motifs that help to elevate the film's emotional moments.However, the film's villain, Loki, can feel somewhat underdeveloped at times. While Tom Hiddleston brings a sense of charisma and wit to the role, the character's motivations and backstory are not always clear, making him a somewhat one-dimensional antagonist.Overall, ""The Avengers"" is an entertaining adventure/action movie that succeeds in bringing together some of Marvel's most beloved characters on the big screen.

"The Avengers","DAZINPARIS","11 May 2012","Here's why ""The Avengers"" fails so badly.1. Wrong, wrong director - Joss Whedon is a TV Director. ""Serenity"" worked because it was essentially a TV movie. And he has here made ""The Avengers"" a TV movie. Bad move, this should have gone to J.J. Abrams, Bryan Singer or Brad Bird.2. Dreadful miscasting - only Robert Downey Junior can hold his head high. Chris Evans is as wooden in this as the flat ""Captain America"" film. Those playing Thor, Hulk, Black Widow either phone in performances or look embarrassed.3. Weak, weak villain - Tom Hiddleston plays a slight, camp character who offers little panache or interest and more closely resembles a spoiled teenager than anything else. This film needed a ""General Zod"".4. Too much obvious CGI - come on, it's 2012, there's no excuse for the George Lucas-y effects like the flying Shield craft graphics.5. No drama, tension and a script so obviously flat that Whedon inserts misplaced self conscious quips to lighten the tone.For anyone growing up with Marvel comics in the 70's (chime with me on this), we deserved SO much more. For younger audiences, it will pass I'm sure.Really can't understand though the positive reviews. Am I alone in this ?","7/10"
"The Avengers","Anurag-Shetty","27 April 2012","Could anyone imagine that the likes of Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America(Chris Evans), Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), & Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) would come together for a movie?! Well they do, in The Avengers! The movie opens with a bang, as Loki(Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and wreaks havoc at the S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters. Loki steals the Tesseract, an energy source of unlimited potential. He puts Professor Erik Selvig(Stellan Skarsgard) & Hawkeye under his control & leaves with them. After the incident at the headquarters, Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) decides that he has to reignite the Avengers Initiative, a project that had been canceled, only recently. In comes Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff who starts recruiting superheroes to form The Avengers. First, she recruits Bruce Banner aka the Hulk who, until then, had been hiding in Calcutta, India. S.H.I.E.L.D needs Banner to check the potential of the Tesseract. The new recruit is Captain America who had been frozen for quite some time(these events took place in Captain America: The First Avenger) & woke up after being in a deep slumber for seventy years. After that, S.H.I.E.L.D recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Thor joins the gang shortly thereafter. However, before the team can take on Loki, the heroes have to solve their personal issues & cut down their giant egos & work together as a team. Problematic? Yes! Iron Man's sarcasm only seems to worsen the situation. The way he makes fun of the others is hilarious! First off, I want to say something. The Avengers is the best movie of the year, so far! Be it the story, the superhero vs. superhero battles, or the sheer epic scale of the film. Loki, is the perfect super villain who is, evil & menacing. The 3D effect in this movie is just eye popping! You will literally duck down every ten seconds. The cinematography is brilliant. The way they've shown Calcutta is authentic. The battle in New York City is outstanding! A note on the performances. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Iron Man is my most favorite character in the film. Chris Evans is impressive as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is great as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is effective as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is simply wicked as Loki. Even though he's the only villain in the movie he's pulled it off superbly. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill & Stellan Skarsgard as Selvig are superb as well. So, grab your 3D glasses, buy some popcorn, sit back & relax as you watch the most entertaining movie in recent times! Don't miss this on the big screen no matter what people! Now, let's see if The Amazing Spider-Man or The Dark Knight Rises top this one. The bar has been set very high though!","10/10"
"The Avengers","hitchcockthelegend","30 December 2012","The Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.Asgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.I have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.I wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.Flaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10","10/10"
"The Avengers","lucyyy","30 October 2014","""The Avengers"" brings together a group of extremely talented actors and epic superheroes, to create an action packed movie with hilarious banter laced into countless scenes. Superhero movies give actors a chance to play new characters with personalities they have never portrayed before. Chris Evans is the extremely passionate and kind hearted Captain America, while Robert Downey Jr is the tougher and sassier Iron Man. The film is very creative with introducing each character and later bringing them together. The villain, Loki Laufeyson, played by Tom Hiddleston, even shows his weak spots and is almost seen as part of the Avengers team. The actors have fantastic chemistry with each other on and off screen, and they make man- tights and capes look more fashionable than ever. The majority of the film is done by special effects, made by an amazing team. They transform New York City into a place for heroes, placing Tony Stark's towering house in the middle of the city. Even at the end of the film, the unsuspecting Tony Stark is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of everyone else. This is a wonderful movie to watch if you want to be thoroughly entertained while having your feeling played with at the same time.","9/10"
"The Avengers","adlion944","22 August 2012","I'll preface... I'm not a comic book reader. I enjoy fantasy, as long as it makes sense in its own self-created universe (Star Wars and Trek, Harry Potter, Superman). But the Avengers is awful, and even worse considering how highly rated this junk is on IMDb. It has a couple moments of delight (but so did the Phantom Menace), and the effects are state of the art, bar none. But, this is the 50th movie in a row where the photorealistic effects impressed me. Now, I'm afraid I need a real movie to use that CGI to good effect.The Avengers fails for me due to the character combination. I didn't read a single comic book, but Universal released this huge budget movie knowing they will need to attract 10 new people for everyone who read the dusty old comic books. The Avengers are a dumb assembly of heroes. Captain America is an idiot character. He is from a different time, isn't good at anything modern (like why is he barking orders?), and has no powers whatsoever. Ditto for Black Widow and Hawkeye. I mean, the latter shoots friggin arrows. Cappy had a shield and punches guys within 5 feet of him. They are just plain lame. Thor is a GOD and the Hulk is invincible. They're immortal. Unstoppable. And Iron Man, with his impossible-to-believe suit which might as well be magic-based is also nearly invincible. Who needs the other 3? Why isn't Spiderman in this group? Or some of the X-Men? As for the humans, why do we have a city-sized aircraft carrier? That flies and looks amazingly like the big aircraft from Avatar? Why build a ship that flies? Okay, now the plot. I don't get it. This movie is 2:22 minutes. I don't even understand Loki's motivation or plan. Loki wants to blow up Earth? Why? Why do those Aliens/Clash of the Titans monsters want to blow up Earth? Why could Thor and Loki get to Earth but they can't without the magic portal? Are those monsters magical or technological? And that cube - seriously, they used the same lame McGuffin from Transformers. Which is a movie very much like this one. I mean that as an insult. What was Loki's plan, crumble the outer shells of buildings in NYC. Shoot a lot and not hit anyone? Not one human even seemed to get hit with all the devastation.I hated it. My wife and kids hated it. My 9 year old son hated it. That says it all. It made no sense, was utterly talky and boring for a huge chunk of it. The Dark Knight wipes its rear end with this blu-ray disc. Avoid at all costs unless you liked Transformers 3, John Carter and Clash of the Titans.","10/10"

The combination of hardcore assassins Widow and Hawkeye, reclusive Banner, arrogant Iron Man, leader Cap and the Norse brothers Thor and Loki mixes itself together into a concoction of personalities and superpowers which guarantees to impress.Marvel has set the bar high for themselves.

"The Avengers","stixman46","12 May 2012","I don't want to waste more time talking about a movie that I just wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching but I feel it's necessary in order to maybe save someone from making the same mistake I just did by watching this stinker. Actually I slept through some of it so there was SOME valuable time spent in the theater. I would have walked out except my girlfriend look like she was enjoying it. This movie just sucked, plain and simple. It's the typical good guys have to save the earth from aliens. It did have all the emotions though.....The dialog was laughable and the acting made me want to cry. Unless you just like seeing buildings getting demolished and people who are impervious to bullets, explosions, and every kind of weapon known to man, stay home and save your money. I've watched better cartoons as a kid. It actually angers me that there are so many people in this world the simply LOVED this movie. This movie was so bad, I may never go to the theater again!","9/10"
"The Avengers","brad-330-904663","12 May 2012","Terrible. Complete trash. Brainless tripe. Insulting to anyone who isn't an 8 year old fan boy. Im actually pretty disgusted that this movie is making the money it is - what does it say about the people who brainlessly hand over the hard earned cash to be 'entertained' in this fashion and then come here to leave a positive 8.8 review?? Oh yes, they are morons. Its the only sensible conclusion to draw. How anyone can rate this movie amongst the pantheon of great titles is beyond me.So trying to find something constructive to say about this title is hard...I enjoyed Iron Man? Tony Stark is an inspirational character in his own movies but here he is a pale shadow of that...About the only 'hook' this movie had into me was wondering when and if Iron Man would knock Captain America out...Oh how I wished he had :( What were these other characters anyways? Useless, bickering idiots who really couldn't organise happy times in a brewery. The film was a chaotic mish mash of action elements and failed 'set pieces'...I found the villain to be quite amusing.And now I give up.

"The Avengers","DarkVulcan29","7 May 2012","It took Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America to build up to this, and was it worth the wait, Yes in deed.Nick Fury(Samual L. Jackson) brings together Captain America(Chris Evans), Iron Man(Robert Doney Jr), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk(Mark Rufalo), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) in hopes of stopping Loki(Tom Hiddleston) from world domination.It was worth it all the way through. Samual L. Jackson this time is front and center, and really shines in the role of Nick Fury. So does everybody else, Mark Rufalo really brings his own to Bruce Banner, although I do miss Edward Norton in the role, Rufalo does quite well. And Tom Hiddleston is quite menacing as Loki, more so then he was in Thor(2011), he was the best villain, almost tops The Joker. The rest of the cast are pretty good also. The Effects are great, the battle scenes are epic. This is a Marvel film that should not be missed.","9/10"
"The Avengers","OneMovieLover","2 August 2012","'The Avengers', first of all, is a good movie. While sometimes overlong, it's entertaining, and the action scenes are amazing. However, it doesn't have enough depth to be another one of those ""classic superhero films"". The reputation instead should be ""enjoyable superhero flick"". First off, if an effort is made to assemble all of MARVEL's Avengers, that effort must be made with a little more success than this. 'The Avengers' ends up feeling like more sequel than spin-off, instead of studying and developing each character. If we're supposed to care about all these superheroes...give them noticeable differences, more display of emotions, and a distinctive background. Just because they're superheroes who have some funny one-liners doesn't mean the viewers will automatically think they're the best people who ever lived. In other words, the characters have too little depth. Something that bugs me is that a few people have been saying this is better than Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, yet the latter is a perfect example of a series of films that have greatly influenced (and perhaps even transcended) the superhero genre. In 'The Dark Knight' there wasn't a single character who was ""just there for nothing"". Meanwhile, Loki is an uninteresting villain and doesn't hold a candle to Heath Ledger's disturbing, brilliant portrayal of The Joker (who, on the other hand, actually seems like a villain even when he's just not doing anything). How come 'The Avengers' all have to work to defeat Loki and his army, while Hulk can simply toss him around like a plastic spoon? That said, the long action sequence where the assembled Avengers all defeat Loki's army is quite outstanding, and many detractors of this film admit that this is also the best part. It contains amazing cinematography, like a minute-long shot that steadily observes each Avenger and sees how they're doing with the aliens. Of course, the rest of the action scenes are also top-notch, considering there's fighting for most of the movie. The sequence with Black Widow running away from The Hulk is especially memorable, and displays arguably the most likable Avenger here, along with Iron Man. The two that we care the most about.Overall, I'd say that 'The Avengers' could have been cut about 20-30 minutes short to flow more as a superhero film. I had hoped for more character development, since there were so many characters to pay attention to. I loved the action, and was pleased with the clever action scenes, especially the last 40 minutes and the parts with Black Widow. It's undeniably entertaining, and while it's not transcendent and genius, it's a great popcorn-flick. Would I see it again? Yes, but not my #1 priority.","2/10"
"The Avengers","kylehaines96","5 May 2012","My friend took me to see the most hyped movie of the year and I have to say as a fan of superhero movies this is the best one by far.The film is about Nick Fury played by Samuel L Jackson who wants to assemble an army of ""Avengers"" Consisting of Iron Man played by Robert Downy Jr, The Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo, Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson, Captain America played by Chris Evans, Thor played by Chris Hemsworth and Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner who have to take out Loki Thor's Brother played by Tom Hiddleston from destroying the world with a device known as The Tesseract.This was such a great movie. The action was fantastic, has great special effects, Really funny moments like the guy playing Galaga on the job(if you have seen the movie then you know what I'm talking about), a fantastic Third act which some of the movie was shot in my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, There is a Cameo by Stan Lee at the end of the movie. and the only superhero movie I know that has a reference to Marijuana in it. The only complaint was that it felt like a 3 1/2 hour movie, but since the movie was that good I can let it slip.

"The Avengers","2013venjix","13 May 2012","This film is not only spectacular but its an ""historic"" superhero feature film at its best. This is worth the wait. Hell, this was worth the wait 7 years ago when it was first developed. Do we really think this will be in development hell? This is The Avengers ""EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES!"" This is something what has NEVER been done before & Marvel has got there finger on the pulse. In 1998, a minor marvel character featuring a human/vampire hybrid made it way to the big screen. In 2000, a group of mutants evolved into the box office. In 2002, was the year of the Spider.After Daredevil, Hulk (Ang Lee), The Punisher, Elektra, Man-Thing, Fantastic Four & Ghost Rider, Marvel Studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures & the funding will come from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. The result led to the creation of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". Sounds cool, right? It was. No, really, It F***in' was. Iron Man made its motion picture debut, The Hulk got rebooted, Thor & Captain America have ""FINALLY"" got the Big screen treatment. Then came a huge shift in the Marvel universe.... Marvel Entertainment is now owned by Mickey Mouse.Amazing. Disney let go the Power Rangers franchise & bought Marvel.But after everything from comics to TV & film Marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as a company & knowing the fact that the biggest supporters (including me) are the fans. That is why they CAN NOT Disappoint us. Yeah, we complain about story lines, costumes & special effects, But if they stay true to the comics, the films would have done its justice. But i know deep down, Marvel Studios will always put out films & stay close to the material. So, what i've said earlier, was it worth the wait? Yes. Yes it was ""definitely"" worth it.Marvel Studios, the cast & crew of The Avengers did an amazing job & on the Marvel Cinematic Universe & i can't wait to see what comes next.Now if DC & Warner Bros. step their game up, we would like to see the Justice League into the big screen.","10/10"
"The Avengers","SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","10 June 2012","It's finally here. OH MY GOD. As a big comic fan it's amazing to see how far the genre has come in the last decade. We finally get star studded spin-off featuring a large cast of some of the greatest characters. If you've been living under a rock, then you may not have noticed that over the last five years, Marvel have been churning out their big hitters and building up to The Avengers. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk join forces to stop Thor's brother, Loki and his alien army. Sure, the plot is simple, but that's what we want for a big smackdown. For any team we need a great leader and Marvel have found the best in Joss Whedon. With his familiarity with large ensembles he effortlessly gives every hero their due. He also manages to flesh out characters in very short scenes. We get a sense of Stark and Potts relationship, some back story for Black Widow and Hawkeye, the confusion of Rogers and so forth. He does his best work with Hulk. I've loved every incarnation of the Hulk so far, so I was wary of Ruffalo's performance. He captures it perfectly, going for a more nervous and geeky Banner. When the Hulk is unleashed, Whedon makes sure to not take it too seriously. Hulk gets the biggest laughs in this surprisingly comic film. The action is fantastic, with a number of exciting set pieces. The final battle has so many wonderful character moments immersed in the action, and they really do work as a team. There are a couple of shortcomings. The alien race is just pathetic, and never really feels like a threat. Add to that the whole mother ship destroyed and every alien dies plot convenience. The film lacks any real threat. We hear about the many people Loki kills, but we never see anything that relates to this. Without seeing the sacrifices made it's hard to get too involved. There are also a few moments where characters just happen to show up. These are things that are minor nitpicks. After all, the only way to do a perfect Avengers movie would be to have an unlimited budget and unlimited running time. What it does achieve is simply amazing and very exciting for the future of superhero films.","8/10"
"The Avengers","moviexclusive","19 April 2012","A colossal wave of fevered anticipation has preceded the arrival of 'Marvel's The Avengers', the culmination of five incredibly successful standalone films over the last four years. Not only has helmer Joss Whedon not cracked under the immense hype, he has amazingly managed to surpass the loftiest expectations with a movie that towers over the rest that have come before it, combining jaw-dropping action, tongue-in-cheek humour and poignant drama into a dazzling piece of summer blockbuster entertainment. Proving that the whole can be so much more than the sum of its parts, Wheedon has distilled the best elements of each of the preceding movies into this assembly of Marvel superheroes- Iron Man is wiry and snarky as ever; Thor is just as Godly in his might but Human-ly in his compassion; and Captain America is still appealingly old-school. The Hulk, or Bruce Banner in his human form, is quite something else altogether though (being the only character to have a change of actor from the aforementioned films) and very much all the better for it- but we'll save our gushing for later.It shouldn't come as any surprise that the one movie which 'Avengers' is most intimately associated with is 'Thor', given that both share the same villain- Thor's adopted brother and fellow Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston)- and that Wheedon did shoot the post-credits scene with Loki and S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Opening with a recurring character from that movie, Dr Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) is now assisting with experiments on the Tessaract which has quite unexpectedly displayed a life of its own.Turns out that the fallen Loki has been drafted by an alien race to lead its invasion of Earth, using the same Tessaract as a portal to cross over from their universe to ours- and his arrival not only leads to the decimation of the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, but also the takeover of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr Selvig to do his bidding. With the fate of the world in the balance, Fury activates his 'Avengers' initiative to gather the aforementioned superheroes with two others- Black Widow and Hawkeye. Even from the outset, it's clear that there is organic spontaneity in Wheedon's storytelling, as he fluently weaves together the recruiting exercise by Fury and his trusted agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the participating superheroes. The best he saves for last, so even though Thor only first appears half an hour into the movie, his is a spectacular entrance befitting of that for a God, crossing paths with Iron Man for a thunderous one-on-one clash in the middle of the woods.True to the spirit of the books, the assembly of these superheroes begins on a fractious note- chiefly due to Stark's distrust of Fury and disdain for the star-and-stripes-outfitted Captain America. Instead, Stark teams up with the only person he deigns as his intellectual equal- Bruce Banner- to locate the Tessaract and uncover what dirty secrets Fury has been keeping from the rest of them. The answer to the latter isn't all too unexpected, but kudos to Wheedon for tying this little detail nicely with what happened in 'Thor'. It will take something colossal to jolt them out of their self- centredness- and believe us when we say that game-changer is certainly massive, counting for the first of two action setpieces in the movie that will undoubtedly qualify amongst some of the most spectacularly thrilling stuff you'll see on the big screen this year. And just when you think it couldn't get any better, Wheedon tops it with an even grander and absolutely breathtaking climax set in the heart of New York City.The reason why the finale works so brilliantly is the same as why the entire movie is that awesome- Wheedon loves and respects each and every superhero character just as much. Wheedon gets the action pitch-perfect through reinforcing the individual powers of each one of the superheroes before uniting their strengths to form an even mightier coalition. It is nothing less than pure ecstasy when they join forces as a team, and you'll find it difficult to resist getting up from your seat and cheering for them at various points throughout the remarkable finish.This review however won't be complete without a special shout-out for the Hulk, many fans of whom have been disappointed by both the Lee Ang and the later Louis Leterrier iteration of it. Here, Wheedon has finally gotten it right, blending both the character's brains and brawn to crowdpleasing effect- even more so through some clever plotting that ensures Banner's eventual transformation from man to beast is as rewarding as it should be. Indeed, there's really no reason why you shouldn't be running out and catching this the first instance it opens. Calling it the perfect summer blockbuster is probably not enough to do justice to just how brilliant it is, and well deserving of every superlative we have lavished on it thus far. Filled with wit, humour and incredible action, it ranks as one of the most- if not the most- entertaining and exhilarating experiences you'll have at the movies this year.","7/10"
"The Avengers","natcarr-74-27114","14 May 2012","Loved this movie, even at almost 3 hours long it didn't drag. Joss Wheddon (Firefly and Buffy) effortlessly out did all of the battle scenes in every Transformer movie with the climatic showdown. there are even two or three seriously laugh out loud moments, mostly concerning The Hulk, but don't worry the film takes itself fairly seriously so you can escape into the story and immerse yourself.Fans of Ironman, Thor and Captain America will not be disappointed. Every one of the superheroes gets their moment in the sun. And of course, there's Scarlett's character Black Widow. YUM! I'm giving the movie 10/10 (2D HD version) because it's so entertaining and it fulfilled all my expectations. You won't be disappointed.As far as the format goes though, stick with HD, there wasn't any real 3D moments. If you are hugely into your 3D experience, think twice before paying the extra, there wasn't any stand out 3D moments, but lots of out of focus backgrounds which kinda wasted the small fortune that must have been spent on production. Go HD you'll get a better experience.","10/10"
"The Avengers","tieman64","24 August 2013","Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" opens with the arrival of Loki (Tom Hiddleson), Norse God of Mischief, on the planet Earth. Here he encounters Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of a superhero law enforcement agency. This introductory sequence is designed to show off both Loki's ruthlessness and the manly coolness of Nick Fury, but it achieves neither. It's an over-long sequence, filled with bad CGI and second-rate action.The film then offers a series of vignettes in which Fury assembles a group of superheroes, including Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Their task? Stop Loki and his giant CGI army. The problem? All these superheroes are too busy bickering to band together, organise and efficiently kick butt.Your typical Whedon tale centres on a Scooby Doo gangs of likable heroes (""Serenity"", ""Firefly"", ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", ""The Astonishing X-Men"" etc) and ends with a hero sacrificially dying for the greater good. Whedon's heroes are also never able to prevail without a little help from their buddies, and there is always some tension between being the sole saviour and having to work with others to accomplish a goal. As he typically has only tiny budgets at his disposal, Whedon also relies heavily on clever writing, witty banter and comedic irreverence to generate excitement. With ""The Avengers"", however, he has been granted zillions of dollars and has been unconsciously domesticated by the demands of the summer blockbuster. The result is a film which is continually pulling in two directions, wanting to be huge, bloated and filled with generic spectacle on one hand, and wanting to be clever, small and intimate on the other. In the end, the vulgarity of money wins out over good prose.Still, a number of classic Whedon moments do survive. One cleverly written vignette has Black Widow tied to a chair, seemingly being interrogated by a gang of villains. We then learn that it is she who is in control of the situation and that it is SHE who is interrogating THEM. Another clever moment sees Loki imprisoned in a glass cage at the heart of our heroes' stronghold (yes, that clich√© again), no one realising that Loki has designed his own capture, the God of Mischief attempting to live up to his namesake and sow discord within his enemy's own home. Most of the film's other good scenes revolve around the Hulk, who's imbued with much pathos by Mark Ruffalo, an actor renowned for his many melancholic-man roles; Ruffalo elevates everything he touches.The rest of ""The Avengers"" unfortunately degenerates into CGI fisticuffs, Michael Bay styled mayhem, exploding cities, CGI aliens, errant missiles and sequences which feel like an angry kid bashing action figures together. Here's a film which spends zillions of dollars bludgeoning us, when a guy like Whedon can cook up infinitely more excitement with a simple rope, chair or the sheer possibility that the Hulk might go schizoid. Like most Marvel projects, ""The Avengers"" mistakes excess for excitement.Whedon's never been a good visualist. Even his stint writing for the ""X-Men"" comics (""The Astonishing X-Men"", a series arc which plays almost exactly like Whedon's ""The Avengers"" movie) relied more on words, banter, and the energy of his prose than well drawn panels. In this regard, most of ""The Avengers"" is slow and generically shot, though it does contain a few great visuals. A brief shot of a SWAT squad advancing on the Hulk's tiny shack is particularly cool. Beyond this, the film offers the usual super-hero subtext. Here the enemy hopes to invade America (New York) and obtain the Tesseract, a much coveted cube which can provide endless energy and which was placed on Earth thousands of years ago by Gods. Our heroes, of course, band together to stop the theft of the Tesseract. In a previous Marvel film, ""Captain America"", a Nazi figure called Red Skull also attempted to acquire this energy source. In Marvel lore, it's always our squeaky clean, white Western ubermensch who decide who gets to keep Earth's resources. Same as the real world, though the Pentagon rarely wears spandex when it's nuking for oil grids.Incidentally, Whedon's Loki is one of the most pathetic super-villains of all time. He's a whiny dude, with all the menace of a high school chemistry teacher. You'd think The Avengers would assemble only for big fish, but no. They apparently take on wimpy Norse Gods as well.7.5/10 ‚Äì See Josh Trank's ""Chronicle"".","6/10"
"The Avengers","aaronjbong","6 May 2012","After years and years of anticipation, we finally get to see some of our favorite superheroes meet and fight together as a team. Creating a movie like this is difficult, considering that it would be hard to combine the different superheroes' story lines and merge them into one storyline. However, Marvel pulled that off easily by strategically releasing movies over the past four years about each of the heroes to serve as prologues and create anticipation for this amazing, awesome, action-packed ""The Avengers"".In the first 45 minutes, we see what has happened to our favorite Marvel superheroes in their own respective lives. Iron Man is forced back into action when he was in the middle of a date with Pepper Potts. The star-spangled soldier Captain America has woken up from his 70-year-old frozen sleep and has a lot to explore in his new surroundings. The new fresh revamped Bruce Banner has been helping sick kids in India. Black Widow is taking a day off by taking another mission when a call from Agent Coulson requires her to return to normal business with Nick Fury. Thor comes a bit later on and we meet newcomer master archer Hawkeye.So what's the danger this time? It's none other than Loki from ""Thor"". To answer some of your questions, No, he didn't die (the post-credits scene from ""Thor""). So even if he didn't die, how did he arrive on Earth when the bridge connecting the different universes has been destroyed? Apparently, Loki was saved by another alien race called the Chitauri. He offers a deal with the Chitauri leader; he will command the Chitauri army in an attempt to subjugate Earth in exchange for the Tesseract. So Loki arrives through the Tesseract (which has the ability to build portals) on Earth and starts to execute his plan.While Loki was doing fine in the early stages of his schemes, the heroes didn't get along so well in the beginning. As reality would suggest, the members of the team get into some fights (there's one action-packed scene where Iron Man fights against Thor with Captain America caught in between). There's a lot of dispute between the superheroes, much to Loki's favor, all due to either rivalry, jealousy, suspiciousness, or many other reasons. This gives the heroes more humanity and possibly some vulnerability which really make the movie more realistic. This is just one of the highlights of Joss Whedon's flawless script.Joss Whedon also successfully blended the different universes of the different superheroes and made it into one film. This is rather difficult considering the natures of the superheroes. World War II to Captain America seems like yesterday and he still has a lot to catch up with (he doesn't know who Stephen Hawking is). Thor, who is of mythological nature, is still used to Asgardian lifestyle. Joss Whedon successfully pulled this off and so the interaction between the different superheroes seem sensible, not awkward. The dialog is perfect and natural.Perhaps the best thing about this movie is the action. By giving the characters the sense of vulnerability, the fight scenes seem more risky and more heart-pumping. While it may be heart-racing, the action scenes are also fun to watch, especially when we see the Incredible Hulk in action. The Hulk is just a mindless monster (although he suddenly becomes aware of himself towards the climax) who wrecks havoc at anything that he considers a potential threat. His role in destroying the enemies during the climax was very entertaining. That said, the climax and finale of the film was one of the best and one of the most thrilling I've ever seen. It offers brilliant visual effects and conjures up enough awe to satisfy anyone seeking intense sequences of action. By the end of it, you'll be satisfied but will still be eager for more.The performances were very convincing. Robert Downey Jr. played the role of the quirky Tony Stark to perfection. His dialog, his performance, everything about him was just perfect. Chris Evans also had a strong performance playing the role of Captain America. He was able to exploit the Captain's inner feelings. Chris Hemsworth also did justice with Thor, Samuel L. Jackson did a commanding job as Nick Fury, Jeremy Renner played a determined Hawkeye, Scarlett Johansson played a sexy and deadly Black Widow, Tom Hiddleston portrayed a malicious and manipulating Loki. However the main star of the show was Mark Ruffalo as the incredible Hulk. He was able to portray a calm, tranquil Bruce Banner but also showed signs that Bruce Banner can, at any time, become the Hulk.The humor is heart-warming and very well. Every now and then, there's always a little bit of humor to cheer up the audience. While one might expect that most of the humor would come from the charismatic Robert Downey Jr., actually the humor is divided equally among the characters including Loki. Why I love this is because every character has a chance to shine and steal the scene.""The Avengers"" is a must-see and a great movie to start the summer movie season. It's got the interesting premise, the operatic action scenes, the great jokes and many more to offer. This is absolutely one of the best, if not, the best superhero film of all time. It offers a great deal of fun for a broad range of viewers. Just get up from the couch, head to the nearest movie theater and watch ""The Avengers"". It's great and 3D is a viable option. Oh, and once the credits roll, don't leave yet. There's two post-credits scenes you don't want to miss, and one of them involves the Chitauri leader.Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: ""The Avengers"" is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films of all time and is guaranteed to blow audiences away with plenty of action sequences, outstanding visual effects, a powerful script, and solid performances.","9/10"
"The Avengers","danieltay47","29 June 2012","At first when I heard of this show, I was kinda excited about it. But when I went to the cinemas yesterday to watch it, I was tempted to leave my seat already at the early part of the show. It's not the characters or actors that is horrible, it's the director to be honest. I don't know how the script writers come what with this or even how the director approve it, but the lines and conversation were so fake, blunt and seriously horrible. It lakes emotions, feelings or even creativeness. Let alone, the whole plot is too predictable and boring. No doubt the action scenes is good and the graphic is awesome, but the plot and horrible lines just make this show right at the bottom of my list for shows in 2012. I rather watch ""The Dark Knight"" anytime rather than this horrible show. Even friends of mine who are crazy about DC and Marvel comics were absolutely disappointed in this show. In fact, they leave the theatres during halfway of the show. This is just an example to show how horrible it is. All in short, this show to me is not worth watching or buying and was a waste of 143 minutes of my time.","1/10"
"The Avengers","Thecritichood234","6 October 2023","This is what kickstart the MCU and how he became great this was the first ever superhero crossover that we've seen any piece of very very well this film took C list characters in turned them into household names throughout the MCU. Loki as a villain was so entertaining into me probably the best performance in this movie Iron Man, Captain America Thor, black widow hulk, and Hawkeye were all interesting, and had a character arc of reuniting as a team and they did that really good. The only problem that I have with this movie is just a joke. It was too many jokes, but they balance out the jokes with the seriousness, and made sure he didn't feel like a parity of itself. This was a really good movie, and where the MCU became a cultural phenomenon 9/10.","8/10"
"The Avengers","saad_khi","29 May 2012","Six (super heros) versus one nemesis!! Otherwise usually it's one against one. The fact is this film is over-hyped and doesn't live up to what it claims to be nor does it complement the critics' excitement, which is to rave the first action movie of the summer - like a ritual and to be quoted in the ads. While watching I asked myself how many times have I seen done to death special effects like a gaping hole in the sky? The aliens raining and attacking New York? Technical jargon supplemented by devices and gizmos? Some huge contraption passing for a space station floating in the sky? And so much executed and projected before that I felt fatigued! The 3D effects are absent where they should have been in your face and more - like when the black widow holds the gun at a character and the nozzle is out of the frame! The cohesive factor, and which keeps it going is the (tongue in cheek) wit, which everyone is blessed with! So much so such dialogues appear to be out of a MAD satire! And to think of it when Thor knew Loki so well or his psyche, then why send for the other five?","9/10"
"The Avengers","JoeDiBease","12 April 2012","Ever since the beginning of the film, I was so amazed and happy That I was at the premier of the movie. Very good acting from all the main characters and good acting from the rest. Great Directing and writing from Joss Whedon too. The cinematography was stunning throughout the whole film.This is a fun action packed film for the whole family to enjoy just like the rest of the Marvel movies but better. The special effects by far are the best for any Marvel movie. The Hulk Looks so much more real. By the way The Hulk made the movie even better. Also, DO NOT SEE THE AVENGERS IN 3D! See the film because you will not be disappointed even if you are not that interested into superhero movies. It has a lot of humor and love, so again SEE IT!","5/10"
"The Avengers","Mahan18","12 May 2012","Yeah, much like everyone else, I friggin' LOVED this movie. This is the purest comic book movie I have ever seen, and for that reason alone it works. Everything, from the writing to the action to the humour to the chemistry between characters to even the pacing feels like it was pulled straight from the pages of the lavishly ludicrous, and having one of the gods of cult sci-fi/fantasy, not to mention a comic book writer, at the helm of this movie was probably the only way this movie could have possibly met with everyone's expectations.4-5 years of build-up to this movie, and it more than just pays off; it wins the jackpot. I am yet to find a person who didn't like this movie, and I can fully understand why. I honestly TRIED to find something about it to even nitpick at, and found nothing. This is the ultimate comic book movie; I highly recommend this to any lover of action, superhero or sci-fi movies, as well as to any avid comic book readers. For all those who don't fit into these categories, this movie may just convert you.","8/10"
"The Avengers","Jwdjrs","9 July 2012","When I saw previews and commercials for this movie, I got really excited. I was a big fan of the old 70's Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk show. I loved Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk and the 2008 Hulk, so I knew Hulk would make a big impact on everyone who saw Avengers. Tony Stark was just flat out hilarious. 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger was not the greatest Marvel movie. I still liked Cap. America, but I just thought it was too in the 40's (kind of boring). I loved the Thor movie because there was great fun action in almost every scene (like the Avengers). The Avengers tops every Marvel movie I've ever seen and I can't wait for the September 25th Blu-ray/DVD release! I LOVE THE AVENGERS!! It might be hard for The Dark Knight Rises to top this film.","4/10"
"The Avengers","anderson_382","24 July 2012","First thing first, that movie is good. And yes it is just good! Not great, best movie ever or something else! It was just good! Good action, good acting... But, man, the story was way too much clich√© (a bad guy wants to take down the Earth and heroes have to save the Earth and they win...) That's it! Loki was nothing memorable as a villain. Good but not great again. Marvel is so great for that! It's building up the hype and excitement of all the fans! It's been since the first Iron Man movie we're waiting for that one big movie! and marvel KNEW that the fans will never dare to realize how just good and basic the movie really is! I enjoyed the first Iron Man movie way much than this! And I speak as a huge comic fan. I was looking forward to this movie, but i wasn't dying of impatience like all the fans who overrated it! 8.7? Seriously?! What made the movie was only the characters! Because you really care for them and they were more comic book accurate than ever! But that's it... It was funny, entertaining, had great characters but this is way too much overrated by die hard fans who can't face the truth... It deserves a solid 6 out of 10! Its good, but not great... Puny god...","10/10"
"The Avengers","varghesejunior","12 April 2012","Writing a review for a hugely anticipated film just about to release worldwide is a very difficult thing but its equally if not more difficult to hold back your emotions when you've been extremely lucky to watch the most electrifying ensemble in the history of cinema thus far.Don't worry I'm not going to 'spoil' anything you wish to discover on our own accord. But when we talk about being disappointed because of the high expectations we had from a movie i can assure you that no matter how high your hopes may be pinned on this film you will not get be disappointed at any cost.Joss whedon has put together some of the most talented actors out there into a very sensibly written script(Funny, thrilling lacking even a single dull moment) to create what i would like to refer to as a phenomenal film which till now was considered only a rare possibility.I will say one thing though, while the film was still in development i was bit weary of Tom Middleton handling all these superheroes by himself, but to my amazement he was a total 'bad***',intense and menacing a supervillan to simplify what I'm trying to say! hats off to you mate!!! Just one word to sum it all up - MARVELLOUS.","8/10"
"The Avengers","Horst_In_Translation","7 October 2017","Here we have ""The Avengers"", the five-year-old movie from 2012 that was really breaking all box office records back 5 years ago. The director and co-writer was Joss Whedon, at that point mostly known for Buffy and Toy Story, the film that brought him an Oscar nomination. But now, this one here is certainly his career-defining work. The era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and RDJ's Iron Man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a Marvel superhero all-stars film. Thor and Captain America of course have their own films now too. But back to this one here. Hiddleston was still doing a good job and Loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly. Some great potential this character has. Not a surprise at all, Whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy, drama and action sequences. Most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end. The only parts I did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the Tony Stark one-liner moments, but that's also subjective.This film was nominated for its special effects for a BAFTA and an Oscar and lost both times to Life of Pi. Of course, fitting the box office success, it received many other honors during the award season back then. At slightly over 140 minutes, it is a really long watch indeed and I think there were enough insignificant moments to stay under the 2-hour-mark. But I still take it as it is as there wasn't a great deal of dragging which is certainly a success for its duration. Back to the villain, Loki may have been the primary antagonist here, but there is a lot more conflict in here, most of all the Avengers managing to grow into a team that manages to hold their egos back a bit for the greater cause. It's a long way to that. And when it's finally done, Loki reappears by opening the gates to hell or the gates to the ""other end of the universe"" as they were saying. So what was the best thing here? Yes it may be the special effects work indeed as they helped the film nicely to overcome a few lengths. And I am not talking about the spectacular stuff like the explosions here, but also for example about the more subtle effects like what Iron Man sees written in his mask.So yeah, overall I think this was a good watch. Everybody will have their favorites from the cast, but as the film is so long, every bigger character gets his solid deal of screen time. For me, these would be Jackson, Renner and ScarJo of course, even if I must admit that SLJ's character did not do a whole lot for me in here. It's a film you want to watch when you are in for some pointless fun. It's of course not a realistic movie at all from start to finish, but it's still a success and not just in quality, but also definitely from the commercial perspective. No surprise number 3 is coming out soon. Still the IMDb and RT ratings may be a bit too high to be honest. Nonetheless, if you are not one of the million people who have seen and rated this blockbuster here on IMDb, it really is high time to finally go check it out. Today was the second (or third) time I watched it and I think it does not lose any of its appeal on rewatch. Go for it, especially if you like Marvel films. I give this first (new) Avengers film a thumbs-up. The character are really interesting and fun to watch, not just during their introduction in the first 45 minutes.","1/10"
"The Avengers","Leemsn-co-uk","28 April 2012","Cannot find too much fault in this film, apart from maybe the fact you will need to have seen all previously related films, luckily I had seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America and Thor, so I knew the back story from the get-go.I feel all of the characters were given enough screen time, I would have maybe liked to see Thor a bit more, I think he was underused, he could have done a lot more with his massive power, like killing one of those massive lizard things on his own, the character of the Hulk was brilliantly well played by Mark Ruffalo, he portrayed Banner as a very calm and collected man and very laid back which is needed for him, it created a newfound interest in the character for me, as I was never a great fan of the Hulk. As always Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job of Iron Man, with the majority of the film's funny lines coming from him.Chris Hemsworth borough back the mighty Thor and did so tremendously, like I said I think he could have been used a lot more, the Black Widow was also a nice addition, even though she had appeared previously in Iron Man 2, (although the tight leather outfit was a bit distracting lol.) I found it incredibly hard to stop looking at her behind, but luckily I was wearing 3D glasses in the dark so nobody could tell.Hawkeye was really well played, for some reason the actor looks a LOT like Gerard Butler to me, I don't know why. But regardless he is a great character and I found it very funny when he asked Iron Man for a lift up to a roof of a building, and Tony Stark replied ""Ok hang on then Legolas"". Little funny lines like that made the entire cinema laugh a lot.The humour of the film mainly came from Iron Man/Tony Stark, also quite a lot of funny moments came from Bruce Banner/The Hulk. I was a bit confused as to why he can suddenly control the Hulk, when he completely lost control on the ship earlier on. There were deep and meaningful thoughts about Bruce's alter ego, but there was a lot of humour to be had from the Hulk as well, (particularly when he smashes Loki on the ground again and again).One small annoyance I had was the continuity on the level of strength and toughness each character had. In the film Thor, he was made to look like the most powerful being ever, with one whack sending big ice men flying 50 feet in the air, but in this film he only whacks them back about ten feet, which is exactly the same distance Captain America and Iron Man can hit (which it shows in the fight scene involving the three of them). It's just an annoyance of mine but I found it hard to figure out which one of them had the most strength, fair enough Steve Rogers is a super soldier but Thor is a demigod, you would think he would have a lot more more strength in comparison, one second a whack from Thor's Hammer can knock the Hulk ten feet away, but it doesn't even leave a scratch on Captain America's shield? And yes I know the shield is made with some indestructible material mentioned in the Cap film, but the Hulk is quite tough too and he got knocked away completely.I also kinda wished they fought directly next to each other more, you never see all of them at the exact same place, they're always scattered about and you never get the feeling they are a full team, throughout the film I was waiting for some epic bit where all 5 of them pulled off some unique combo that involved all of them, but the most I got was two or three of them in the same place in the final battle.But all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely frightful, you get some empathy for Bruce Banner, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it, I was worrying it might be too many characters for one film but they nailed it.","4/10"
"The Avengers","EUyeshima","3 June 2012","Unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avant-garde short subjects in tiny projection rooms, then chances are pretty good that you'll have a rollicking good time watching this 2012 megawatt adventure epic. I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that made ""Iron Man"" (1 & 2), ""The Incredible Hulk"" (the 2008 version), ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" purely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable. A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in ""Thor"") while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in ""Iron Man 2"", to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.) For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life. It's gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory.","10/10"
"The Avengers","joachimokeefe","3 May 2012","By geeks, about geeks, for geeks. Tempting the geek dollar out of its den into the local multiplex with a thrill that can't be bought on the Xbox.Is it The West Wing in space? Or is it Stargate meets X-Men? There is not a shred of originality or true imagination in this noisy, flashy, ugly commercial behemoth. It is part of an action figure marketing campaign; a film made by men who still think like pre-teenagers, who were inspired long ago by comic books cheaply churned out by groups of at most six people - who at least had a grasp of characterization.The now-grown comic-book readers have to remain in their adolescent playrooms and pay homage to that excitement because they dare not go out into the world and feel real suspense, fear, or loss. They must burn gazillions of dollars and employ thousands of people in trying to recreate that comic-book buzz. A long-lost childish thrill is the only feeling they are willing to let themselves - or you - experience.Will you join them? Will you sit in a darkened room pretending that you are engaging with life because you have a 3D screen, surroundsound, and a broadband connection? Will it be enough for you to escape into Joss Whedon's stunted teenage netherworld, or will you go outside and attempt to engage with - god forbid - strangers, rather than aliens, superheroes and vampires?There are movies, even trashy ones, that will echo, embellish and enhance your experience of the world. 'Avengers Assemble' isn't one of them; it's shiny, expensive, overwrought trash that assumes we are all as insecure, stupid and frustrated as those who created it.You will have forgotten it long after you still remember how much it cost to get in.

"The Avengers","Chalice_Of_Evil","26 April 2012","As one of the seemingly few who's not a fan of the Iron Man character or his films, and after seeing the trailers, I had my reservations about this film. Was it going to be Iron Man 3, guest-starring the rest? Well, yes and no. It's clear who Joss Whedon's favourites are, as they get the most character development. Those who come out on top: Tony Stark (of course), Black Widow and (surprisingly) Bruce Banner/Hulk. If you're a fan of these characters/the actors who portray them, then you should be satisfied with their amount of screen time.Fans of Stark, who don't mind his attitude and want nothing more than his mumbled speedy snarky lines/blowing stuff up will be the most pleased. Annoyingly, even his love interest gets to be the only one to appear in this film (too bad for Peggy Carter & Jane Foster, both of whom I greatly prefer as characters. Though at least we get to see a *picture* of them and it's mentioned that Jane's safe. I wish Thor had been allowed to reunite with her before he left again). RDJ does his thing, and he's naturally fine doing it, but I'm probably in the minority who prefers him as Sherlock in his Sherlock Holmes films.Captain America thankfully gets to retain his likability, calls Tony out on his BS (there's more than one scene of two verbally sparring) and has his moments of leadership. I was annoyed, however, that his practical costume from CA: TFA was replaced with one that looked like the comical outfit he wore when promoting war bonds during the 'Star Spangled Man' song/dance number in his solo film. It's pretty clear Whedon views him as a 'dork' of sorts, so he's reduced to the butt of jokes and not getting to be 'cool' like Stark. Even with Whedon's clear bias against him, Steve continues to be the most likeable/noble hero.Scarlett Johansson gets to kick sufficient ar$e as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and does a good job of subverting the obvious (something Whedon is a fan of...along with scenes where everyone yells over the top of each other). There are a few moments where it appears she's beaten/showing signs of weakness, but then she turns things on their head and she proves herself to be no damsel and more than capable/not to be underestimated. The one somewhat 'regressive' role Whedon sticks her in is 'beauty taming the beast' in regards to her character and the Hulk.Speaking of the 'other guy'(as Bruce calls him), this Hulk looks better than the two previous movie versions thanks to motion-capture allowing Mark Ruffalo to actually portray the not-so-jolly green giant and even his face bears resemblance to Ruffalo. Bruce gets to be all brooding and restrained for the bulk of the movie, but when he eventually Hulks out, he does plenty smash-o-crash. Unfortunately, Hulk is also played for some rather immature laughs at times, like when he punches Thor after they've just teamed up to take down a baddie (why? Because it's ""FUNNY""!) or he cuts Loki off mid-speechifying by tossing him around like a ragdoll, thus kinda undoing all the effort Tom Hiddleston put into making Loki menacing (there's one exchange he has with Natasha where he comes across truly evil). It's clear Whedon's not a fan of 'god-like' characters and hopes to sway others to be like-minded.Nick Fury gets to be sneaky/manipulative, jumps on the 'Let's blame Thor' train and shoots stuff, as does his offside, Agent Hill (Cobie Smulders), when she's not providing exposition or miraculously escaping death. Hawkeye fans might be a tad miffed that he spends the majority of the film zombiefied by Loki, but is eventually freed of the mind-control and his backstory with Natasha is briefly touched upon. Even Agent Coulson gets a fair amount of development. Disappointingly, Thor gets the short end of the stick...or hammer. I'd thoroughly enjoyed his solo movie and Chris Hemsworth in the role, so I was hoping he'd get the respect/focus he deserved as part of this ensemble cast...but it seemed Tony Stark's one-liners and the Hulk beating Asgardian ar$e for laughs was Whedon's priority, sadly.Poor Thor never seems to be allowed to have a true victory in the film, which is a real disappointment since his character had undergone a true hero's journey in his own film and deserved to be taken seriously, rather than disrespected/treated as the butt of jokes. Sure, he and 'Mew Mew' get to kick a fair amount of butt, but not nearly enough as they *should've*. He doesn't even get to be the one who takes down Loki (his brother...who's adopted) in the end and save everyone, as that victory's given Iron Man and Hulk, of course (and Thor had been about to save Stark's ar$e at the end too until Hulk swooped in and stole his thunder). Such a shame that Thor gets screwed over, but I appreciated his little moments of humour (all the more effective because they *aren't* OTT or at the expense of others) and that he brought some actual seriousness to proceedings/his complicated sibling relationship with Loki wasn't entirely ignored.Despite my few quibbles, the film surprisingly comes together pretty well. Whedon proves he can direct action with the best of them and it's blissfully free of overuse of shaky-cam. It's quite the feat, bringing all these characters from different films together and actually making it *work*, but he pulls it off. Not a dollar of the movie's considerable budget has been wasted. It's all up there on the screen, the humour works (some of the time), all the actors do well in their roles, but I personally would've liked to have spent more time with Cap & Thor and exploring their reluctant partnership (how about a buddy film?). I'm more invested in their own solo films than seeing them sharing time with characters who I'm not a fan of, but not opposed to seeing the Avengers reassemble.","10/10"
"The Avengers","manendra-lodhi","14 May 2012","When I first read about the film I thought it would not be that good to watch a juice of so many characters. But the director was rightfully applauded for his work in giving a good deal of time to all the characters. Everything about the movie is very nice. It takes you through all the characters about whom you would have probably learned a lot and for those who do not know a lot, Marvel has already done everything for them to understand with a series of films based on the individual character. That is a thing that truly marks American films different from others. They know what audience will want and how to serve them. You will find a lot of instances (as I had experienced) when you would just be scared that such a nice film has to come to an end after 2 hours 20 minutes.PROS : I loved the timings of each and every characters except for hulk who was introduced in a simple manner but who ultimately steals the show based on his (my favorite) two dialogs which I have heard from everyone that they liked. The instance when hulk comes into action , everyone have to shout like hell. Iam a big fan of iron man and especially because of Robert Downey but this green character fills up the whole space every time he becomes angry or rather say wants to be angry. What I first thought before entering into this mind blowing film , I had been thinking that Thor would be playing a greater role and since he is some god typo so he will help the avengers the most. But I like to get wrong evreytime I start a film. Than comes our nick fury who though was the leader of the group in papers but appeared to be playing a role of the grand daddy. I felt this especially in the 2nd half. But that was nicely handled as he was doing whatever he could do , and what was best for him. Black Widow and I mean everyone was playing a role that they could play according to their abilities. However a single disappointment was the role of captain America who did not seem to fit properly into the fight sequences. And he was looking a kind of supporting role along side the hawk eye and the black widow.CONS ‚Äì I would have liked to see some more development into the story of the tysserect and how loki got involved with everything. Everyone seemed to be in a little bit of hurry in the second half. Well may be I am too attached to the film that's why I am saying that. ""A must watch for anyone.""","9/10"
"The Avengers","lasttimeisaw","2 June 2012","Harboring a great deal of expectation of this record-breaking multi-superhero-in-a-row action mash-up, I finally caught up the last chance to watch it on the big screen, but unfortunately the film has indomitably become my very first disappointment in 2012. Alerted by the general opinion of ""if you can survive the boring first 60 minutes, the latter part will blow you away"", maybe ""boring"" is a lesser word, the inter-conversations among these superheroes are way too tedious to arouse any interest, and in light of my last encounter with THOR (2011), I know he is a boredom, then here comes his worsen twin, Captain America, so it is dumb and dumber situation. Most of characters are reprising their usual roles, Robert Downey Jr.'s sleekness is being harnessed into its maximum quota. So I assume the only revelation could come from Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, the newcomer on screen, and the third candidate of Hulk, Mark Ruffalo, but the truth is they might be a clear torrent, but cannot save this juggernaut from being a destroy-it-all dross. The fighting scenes are the saving grace here which is not a false claim, but it satisfies my eyes without compensates my soul, director Joss Whedon just haphazardly levels everything in Manhattan without any single casualty provided to imply its minimum credibility. No worries at all, we simply witnessed an empty and meaningless catastrophe without any mind activity as we all know Iron Man will not be the sacrifice as a sequel is already set on a release date. Thus, am I over-demanding here? After the invasion of myriads of this sort of big-budget action flicks, THE AVENGERS is no way a standout by any means, none of its actors could stick out with any arresting existence (I might be too desperate to count out Gwyneth Paltrow), Mark Ruffalo is the closest choice of a decent acting in it, all the rest is just the way he or she is, an utterly featherweight character study is the case here. The gags are scarce (ooh, poor Loki), too much SCI-FI doctrines and the narrative in dead earnest (thanks to you, Mr. Samuel L. Jackson) makes the film's lengthy screen time too overt to be slighted, and I waited until the end-credit rolled over, but a second bonus scenes never show off. The film's huge success has baffled me so much and its staggering status of the third biggest grossing film of all time (after AVATAR 2009 and TITANIC 1997) does make me do some solemn post-mortem to question my taste, the conclusion could be that I may be detached from the majority's liking, which thankfully I believe heralds a good sign for me, right?","10/10"
"The Avengers","ypjoshi","30 April 2012","Action movies will now have a new leader as Avengers assemble by Marvel raises the bar to an entirely new level.The hype made by Marvel in 2011, by Introducing Thor and Captain America to the audience in quick succession just as a precursor for the Avengers ,is lived up and surpassed with what will be one of the beacons in modern era action movies.The boasted budget of $220m,is well spent for the movie expectedly satisfies you as a visual treat with what i think,one of the best CG effects.Also,this one does deserve a heads up to be watched in 3D, unlike annoyingly many in the recent past.Though,the first half has a few more than necessary scenes shot in the dark,but it gets better as the movie progresses.Though the plot is pretty straight-forward,there are so many characters in the movie to keep you entertained in their very own signature fashion.Each and every character is given nearly equal importance and nobody is left out,which is an effort to appreciate. They have really put a lot of efforts in the new Hulk to bring him up to join the party with others,and Boy! it does pay off exceptionally well.Iron Man's powers are tested to a very new level and being the most skilled avenger,they had to be.He has got some new moves, watch out for them!.I am really starting to like Captain America and the way he handles the situation. The time transitioned character of his, adjusts surprisingly quickly to the new scenario.Black Widow and Hawk-Eye who had brushing references in previous movies are full fledged avengers now, but i wish marvel to bring them up in singles.There are a few much needed subtle humorous moments exercising your jaws sideways in between a lot of fantastically choreographed action scenes keeping them dropped down for most of the time.Bout the cast, Downey Jr. undoubtedly stands out as an actor, with his amazing comic timing and the way he carries the arrogance of Iron-Man. The search for Bruce Banner has ended up giving the most subtle hulk yet,with Mark Ruffalo.The Rest of the cast looks just supportive. Cobie Smulders was supposed to be the eye candy,but Scarlett Johansson steals the show in that aspect, not to mention in her alter-ego superhero moves too.All in all, an awesome summer blockbuster with wholesome entertainment. The Avengers is surely one of the best action movies to watch before you leave this dimension.","4/10"
"The Avengers","paulclaassen","7 June 2019","The movie was such a huge box office success that I tried really hard to like it. I just couldn't. Just to be certain, I gave it a second viewing, and disliked it just as much the second time around.Firstly, if you haven't seen Thor, Iron Man, Captain America or The Incredible Hulk, you'll have no idea who the characters are and what they're all about. There haven't been films about Black Widow or Hawkeye, so they don't really matter anyway. The film played like a medley of all of these super hero movies and didn't really offer anything we haven't seen in these movies. Also, due to way too many protagonists for one film, none of them were given the opportunity to develop. In fact, I found all the characters incredibly shallow, and didn't like any of them. My favorite character in the film is probably Hulk.Everything about this film was so overblown and overdone to the level where nothing was believable - within the context of the genre, off course. 'The Avengers' was so CGI heavy that it was difficult to have fun with it. The film also had so many plot flaws and credibility issues. Everything was simply done for effect at the disposal of an interesting plot. Iron Man is just as annoying as in his own franchise (although he is the deepest character of all). So, a mere mortal in a suit Tony Stark (Iron Man) can actually outwit a god like Thor??? Wow, not much hope for gods... The same goes for the powerful god Loki, who is outwitted and outsmarted so easily.The action in 'Dragon Wars' and 'Transformers' was a lot more realistic and more enjoyable than this. I've seen it twice and that's more than enough, thanks.","10/10"
"The Avengers","ThunderKing6","15 August 2019","First I rated this movie a 10 back in 2017 as during that time I was still brainwashed under the MCU. I thought they were prefect movies. I'll keep Avengers 1 as 10/10 instead of giving it a 6/10.
It's great for being a movie on this scale it's just not near the best movies or superhero movies in terms of story and development.Back in 2012 I was MCU hyped and practically worshiped the MCU and praised movies like Avengers 1. At the time in 2012 Avengers 1 I felt was the greatest thing ever.Now in 2019 my views on Avengers 1 and the MCU has changed completely. MCU does not deserve the hype it gets from the general audience and media.
Avengers 1 even for a first take was pretty generic where it still has unanswered plot holes.Avengers 1 is a good movie on its own comparison. Its overrated generally speaking. It has brainwashed fans/kids/fanboys (like I was). I was ignorant to the flaws and worshipped an ugly looking movie like Avengers 1. I once worshipped the MCU like a damn fool.MCU and the Avengers 1 ruins its self with lack of character/story development, under used villains, weak heroes and pointless jokes.Other than Loki, hela and Thanos all villains are jobbers. All the heroes are treated as highly durable in terms of plot device and plot armour.Recommendation: Watch this movie for fun while drinking a beer or some food with a lot of sugar otherwise you may get brainwashed like I was. In addition, if your will power is weak don't watch this movie or any MCU movie.","10/10"
"The Avengers","harry_tk_yung","6 May 2012","Like Bilbo's one-hundred-eleventh birthday party, ""The Avengers"" is a ""long-awaited"" event, after four (not counting Hulk) major features on the ensemble of heroes which grossed a mind-boggling aggregate box office in excess of 2 billion dollars (well over half of which coming from the two editions of Iron Man). The main plot is rather simple, and familiar: (a) Earth is fighting for its very survival against alien invasions and (b) there is an object/device of immense power sought by one and all, good guys as well as bad guys. Assembling the ensemble of six is quite a challenge. Before we examine how cleverly this is done, let's try to catalogue the protagonists. How about into 3 groups? Least ""human"" are Thor and Hulk. Early in the movie, just before his first appearance, a cryptic remark is made about Thor to the effect of something like he is ""basically a god"". Hulk remains human, but only until ""the other guy"" (a term used repeatedly by our hero himself) takes over. Next come the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" category: human with so much done to their body that they become sort of superhuman: Iron Man and Captain America. Finally, there are Black Widow and Hawkeye (altered ego of ""Green Arrow"" of the other camp, the JLA?), Nick Fury's special agents who are one hundred percent human but trained to so excel in combat that they are almost superhuman. The villains are quite unimpressive, serving as punch bags for our heroes, who provide vastly better entertainment by fighting among themselves. Let's see how cleverly this achieved by a plot that is nowhere near being convoluted and yet delightfully un-formulaic.While everything evolves around Nick Fury whose brainchild ""The Avengers"" is, assembling of the team is mesmerizing, providing plenty of opportunities for fights among the heroes. Almost from the first minute, Hawkeye defects to villain Loki who wields a brain-control device. Black Widow succeeds in persuading Hulk to join, but only as a research scientist, not a superhero (they consider ""the other guy"" more a monster than a hero). Captain America, technically over 100 years old, is revived from his deep freeze while Iron Man is led into Fury's scheme much earlier on (off screen), almost like his partner. Soon after Iron Man, with Captain America's assistance, subdues Loki (part of the villain's cunning plot) Thor who seems to have materialized out of nowhere claims his brother for a prisoner, setting off an exciting bout with Iron Man, eventually stopped by Captain America's mediation. At Fury's headquarter (an invisible flying aircraft carries ‚Äì this you will have to see for yourself), five of the six Avengers assemble, with Loki in captivity. The villain's plot is to have the defected sixth (Hawkeye) come to his rescue and destroy his captors. He tries, very close to succeeding, to manipulate the team member's different personalities to set them against each other. Even more damaging, Loki thinks, is a provocation to bring out ""the other guy"", unleashing Hulk's destructive power. It seems to work initially. The attack led by defected Hawkeye provokes the appearance of green monster Hulk. The ensuing combat between the physically two most powerful (Hulk and Thor) is something to behold. While this one is sheer brutal force, the fight between the two special agents is a show of beautiful yet lethal combat techniques. The result: Hawkeye breaks out of the brain control to which he has been subjected and comes back to his senses. As well, Captain American and Iron Man, whose personality conflict has been the biggest obstacle to their cooperation, finally work together as a team.So in the last hour of the movie, while Loki brings out his alien army down on to Manhattan, The Avengers are finally cemented as a team, as you see in the most publicized trailer shot with the camera circling them in an undaunted spirit of solidarity, ready to face whatever enemy that dares to come to Earth. This movie must be seen at least twice. The first time you are dividing your attention between following the story and watching the action. Only in the second time can you fully enjoy the excellent dialogue (rare for an action movie) which will be several times more meaningful than this first. At the same time, you are able to sit back and fully enjoy the action. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth reprise their respective characters, adding a delightful new dimension on personality conflicts. All this is done mostly through crispy, witty dialogue. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, who has made brief and briefer appearances respectively in Iron Man and Thor franchises, bring more complete realization to their respective character, as well as a half-told story of their past relationship which strongly suggests a spin-off prequel. Last but certainly not least is Mark Ruffalo whose soft-spoken, low-key interpretation of Hulk gets two thumbs up from me.And of course there are all the others. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson and Tom Hiddleston's Loki need no introduction, and not even reminders. From Iron Man comes Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and from Thor comes Stellan Skarsgard's Erik Selvig, two more familiar faces. For a welcomed new face is Cobie Smulder's Agent Maria Hill.","9/10"
"The Avengers","Smells_Like_Cheese","6 May 2012","What happens when you get a team of super hero's together who shouldn't be in a room together let alone trying to save a city? You have the Avengers, one of the most anticipated movies for years. I remember working at a movie theater back in 2007 and one of the guys that worked there was telling me about how there was talks to make the film and I thought it was never going to happen, well, clearly this is why I'm not in the stock market. But when I heard that Joss Whedon was behind it, I couldn't wait, he's the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and is one of Hollywood's best writers. He has a genuine love for comics, action and giving characters real depth. After viewing The Avengers, you couldn't ask for better action on the big screen and so much great excitement. I think the fans got everything they were asking for and deserved with this great popcorn flick.Nick Fury arrives at a remote research facility during an evacuation. The commander explains that an energy source of unknown potential has activated and opened a mysterious portal. Through it steps the exiled Loki, who takes the Tesseract and uses his abilities to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel including agent Clint Barton and a few others in order to aid in his getaway. In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the Avengers Initiative: Agent Natasha Romanoff, Dr. Bruce Banner, Agent Phil Coulson, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract from Loki. However, Thor, Loki's adoptive brother, arrives and attempts to free Loki to reason with him. When that doesn't work, the hero's start fighting over who's in charge until they realize that Loki's ego is growing stronger and will destroy the world if they do not stick together and stop him as The Avengers.First off, the actors: Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson all clicked so amazingly well together. I'm still a little bummed that they couldn't get Edward Norton for the Hulk, he was a perfect cast and just excellent in The Incredible Hulk, but Mark gives his own take to the character and comes through in the end. The effects are so amazing and grand to watch on the big screen that this was the only way you should see the movie as they are just tearing New York apart with all these aliens and flying creatures in the middle of down town Manhatten. Now one of the things I do have to laugh a little at is that all the characters get these cool costumes, sleek, sexy and tough¬Öthen you have Captain America who looks like he got his costume at Target. You can't blame the officer he tells to get the police to get the civilians to safety and the officer asks ""and who are you that I should be taking these orders from?"". There are some great comedic moments, especially with Robert Downey, Jr. and The Hulk just going crazy on Loki.There are a couple of flaws in the film like Loki. I don't know if it was the actor, Tom Hiddleston, but I just couldn't really take him seriously as a villain. I found the aliens who were invading more threatening as Loki just keeps saying ""Kneel before me! I am a God!"" and giving you a used car salesman's smile. There are moments where it seems to drag a little with the talking, as we're getting our hero's together. I'm all for development, but I wanted a WWE smack down because we're not given as much depth with these characters as you would say Spider-man or Batman. But I think I'm just nitpicking at this point because I don't want to put anyone off on the film.The Avengers is everything you could ask for in a superhero film. It's got great action, excellent chemistry, good style and is just a ton of fun to watch. I got to see this in a crowded theater where you can tell the audience was just pumped up to see something good and you got to give the film credit for bringing some excitement to the theater. We don't get many exciting films that have actual good writing to it like this. Joss did an excellent job handling these big guys on the screen and I'm looking forward to the sequel. Though I hope there is more egging on of the Hulk, I would have a ton of fun if I were next to him saying what Captain America was talking about his mama.8/10","10/10"
"The Avengers","rosvel92","3 January 2016","I would describe director's Joss Wheddon effect as making live-action persons, behave, act and look more cartoonish than cartoons themselves. In the previous films at least they behave like humans.Really, wish Jhon Favreau had been given the creative freedom he requested. This movie makes X-men: The Last Stand look good.The cast is good, but the dialogue is terrible, interactions between characters are bad, people don't talk like real people, somehow all feel out of character, they talk like people throwing jokes to an audience which is painfully awkward to watch. Dangerously close to self parody territory, I refuse to believe parts of the movie happened.Fails on having a plot of it's own. Also fails as a sequel to the previous movies, and If you were doing, a marathon I would tell you to skip this as somehow despite featuring so many characters the plot is irrelevant to all of them.Half characters are portrayals is inconsistent to the previous movies: -Hulk has new actor and personality, the character is so rebooted it doesn't even feels like it happens in the same Cannon as the Hulk movie. -Loki goes from trying to become King by deceiving Thor out of Asgard, to making a genocidal killing spree on Earth (How does killing people on Earth helps him to become King Asgard? ANswer: It doesn't), Thor is told his brother kills people he says his bro is adopted (That's just awful dialogue, if Thor takes it as a joke, how am I supposed to take the movie seriously? There's no emotional conflict). -Captain America it's just there, but never does anything. -Ironman starts as a douche and by the end isn't, for the third time, the same transformation he experienced on Ironman 1, and also on Ironman 2. - The arrow guy is brainwashed, so he never really gets to talk, and the girl is a generic though token girl, that never gets developed. I would forgive the inconsistency if the movie were better than the previous incarnations, but it is worse.Somehow the army on the climax, looks CGI paper weight, they don't even put up a fight, makes it seem like even a normal civilian could hit and destroy them, with such a weak evil army why even bother in the first place. There's no twist, no stakes, never anything feels at risk. The heroes have the upper hand through the whole movie, they win without never ever making any effort. The action is disappointing, because it's just stupid hits, no stunts, no creative fight set pieces.The Dark Knight Rises deserved the Oscar Nomination, given to this film, Ironman Armor, and Hulk look good, but the CGI Army looks fake generic awful.If you watch it might entertain you, but movie is awful, if this becomes the future of Superhero movies, then the genre might die soon. Or even worse, continue like this for decades.Feel free to disagree but I think, Avengers it's so overrated.","9/10"
"The Avengers","Staffenburgen","22 July 2012","Immediately after watching The Avengers, I was confused. All of my friends seemed to love it, the theater roared its approval as the credits rolled, and most of the reviews I've read are overwhelmingly positive. For these reasons, I'm not entirely sure I watched the same movie as everybody else, but I'm perfectly willing to comment on what I saw. The film opens with Loki stealing the Tesseract, an all powerful energy device that poses a significant threat to Earth's security. Thankfully, Nick Fury assembles the ""Avengers"", the group of superheroes who are the focus of the film. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, and Mark Ruffalo all reprise their roles of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Incredible Hulk, while Scarlet Johansson and Jeremy Renner portray the Black Widow and Hawkeye. Every single one of these characters (Loki included) is entirely one-dimensional and frankly, boring to watch. With the possible exception of the Hulk, they are straight-forward, flawless superheroes, who have absolutely no trouble dispatching anyone who crosses them. This makes the prolonged action sequences particularly difficult to watch; you never doubt who is going to prevail. As for the central story of the film, it is a complete mess. It's an action movie in the truest sense of the word; every aspect of the plot is twisted to encourage more fighting sequences, which really prevents the film from moving forward at all. The story doesn't provoke further thought in any way, and really just serves to provide mindless action and downright terrible dialogue. In particular, Downey Jr. relentlessly delivers sarcastic insults every few minutes, which just aren't that funny (in my opinion). Once or twice, I found it amusing, but by the end of the movie I was sick of it. The other characters aren't much better, with the exception of Thor, who had a few funny moments. Despite everything I have said, there's no criticizing how the film looks. The CGI sequences are stunning, and the various locations in the film are visually pleasing. It doesn't break any new ground, but it's still entertaining. Overall, this is not a good movie. The characters are flat, static, uninteresting people portrayed by uninspired actors. The story is atrocious and riddled with holes. The action sequences are painfully long and predictable. And perhaps worst of all, when it was trying so hard to be funny, it simply wasn't. Looking at all the names that contributed to this movie, I am frankly shocked at the finished product. Joss Whedon is a brilliant director and writer (I loved Firefly), and most of the actors (particularly Downey Jr., Renner, and Ruffalo) are usually enjoyable. So I'm not quite sure where everything went wrong, but hopefully they can produce a more thoughtful sequel with their next efforts. RATING: 4/10","8/10"
"The Avengers","tonyjea92","18 April 2012","I've always loved Marvel films ever since the original Spider man back in 2002 Marvel to me was so much better then DC. Spider man was my favorite superhero and i thought he was awesome and couldn't be beat. But then Iron Man showed up 6 years later and at the end i found out it was just a thread for an Avengers film. Then with some other films in order we the fans have finally gotten what we deserve and that is the crown jewel called THE AVENGERS. This film defiantly deserves the award for most anticipated summer film, best superhero film and so on. If there is one flaw i had to give this film its that this film has an ending to it.

It was a bit lengthy but was touching every single minute. The story was very good and the superhero's were described nicely. Bruce Banner very polite when he was not Hulk, Captain America very serious and all that. It was defiantly worth watching and is one of the best superhero films.

"The Avengers","dhaufrect-1","25 May 2012","An example of inspiring cinema directed for young and old alike, ""The Avengers"" is does it all in this recent block buster. I agree with Rabbi Scott of Houston's Congregation Emanu El, when he described the pleasure he derived from the mesmerized youngsters in the audience as much as his own enjoyment of this super hero film. Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man once again, and he gives another uniformly perfect performance. Chris Evans is Captain America, and he too is outstanding as this superman-like individual fighting for truth and justice and the ""American Way"". Mark Ruffalo plays Dr. Bruce Banner/ The Hulk and he too is well cast and successful with his part. Thor is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, and he too is exemplary with his performance. Of course, there is Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the leader of this brave crew. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, is very convincing and an extremely tough ing√©nue in a film which is not directed by Woody Allen. Joss Whedon has written and directed this smash hit in 3D, and I advise that it be seen with this medium, since the special effects are enhanced to the point of overwhelming reality. Don't miss this remarkable Marvel comic piece. It is worth the effort for you and all the youngsters in the audience who will be glued to the screen.","10/10"
"The Avengers","ThomasMagnumPI","22 April 2012","Everything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the new king of the genre. The Avengers is certainly the best overall comic adaptation film ever made. Really, how could it not be? They positioned this thing with FIVE other set up films that were each remarkable in their own right. Not only does it all come together but I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, every single character featured previously in those five films gets time to really shine at one point or another in this astounding movie. Even though the set up has been epic, the result was anything but assured. It would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the task of putting all these great character together and making it click but they pulled it off perfectly. Maybe it's because the characters themselves are complex and intriguing and that they have been brought to three dimensional life by people that really care. Whatever the case, EVERYONE hits a home run here. They fleshed out perfect cohesion while remembering to include the fun and humor that have made those other five films good. If you define those films as good then you'll define Avengers as great. It's a unified step up and I didn't think that possible. What's also amazing is that I think this movie works without having seen any of those other films. Then, the fun factor will be enjoyed by those that didn't care about the other movies. The depth and amazement will come from those that have invested in to this universe. What they've done is transcend any other of this genre's films by going deeper and doing so in spectacular fashion with Oscar caliber performances. Again, easily the new king of the genre.","1/10"

"The Avengers","rayrodgpa","12 May 2012","I'll admit it, I was extremely doubtful about this film. I've loved Joss Whedon's work my entire life and I had enjoyed all the previous Marvel films that led up to this one, especially Iron Man. But the fact that they brought together all of these different characters from all these different movies and put them together in 2 1/2 hour film was unprecedented and almost seemed impossible. But the optimist in me got me to the theater with me expectations shaky. Once the film started I was quickly drawn in and once the title appeared on the screen I knew that Joss Whedon had done it. The Avengers is without a doubt my favorite Marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made. Whedon did a great job writing this masterful, witty script that ingeniously put together all these characters and made it flow perfectly. The actors did such a great job playing these characters again and it didn't seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got a chance to be in the spotlight(especially the hulk). Once you see all of the characters assemble and fight the bad guys you can't help but fill with happiness. The entire movie was such a fun thrill ride from the beginning to the end and the ending battle scene was brilliantly done. I am extremely delighted to say that Joss Whedon has done the impossible and made one of the most entertaining movies ever made.","10/10"
"The Avengers","horseygurlz","24 December 2012","The danger with every superhero movie is that it will end up either horrifically unrealistic or unappealing to anyone over the age of ten. I am pleased to say that 'The Avengers' does not fall into either of these pitholes - in fact, it has to be awarded the title of one of the best films of 2012.The actors were all amazingly casted in their respective roles and do an amazing job of creating intriguing and lovable characters. Many of them were reprising roles they had taken on in previous films - Captain America, Thor or Iron Man, for example - so we already had a good idea of how they would perform, but I feel they all exceeded expectations. Robert Downey Jr was incredible as the humorous yet conflicted Tony Stark/ Iron Man, and Chris Evans was brilliant as the confused, out-of-time Steve Rogers/ Captain America. Mark Ruffalo, the newbie of the cast, stepped into the role of Bruce Banner/ Hulk with great skill and dispersed all doubts as to his suitability. On the other side, Tom Hiddleston really has to be congratulated for his convincing and somehow relatable performance as the villain Loki, whose wit and tricks appealed to fans everywhere.The special effects in this movie were undoubtedly excellent, and despite their need to be ostentatious never seemed unnecessarily unrealistic. The director Joss Whedon did a fabulous job and has created a cinematic classic that will be praised for years to come.","9/10"
"The Avengers","adammfeeley","11 April 2015","The avengers is a classic marvel movie full of action, stunning special effects and the odd bit of funny humour. I think Age of Ultron will be better but this is still a fun and enjoyable film. I love how it appeals to everyone not just comic book fans. I can't find any flaws in this movie , it kinda has everything you need in a good movie:action, comedy, cool quotes and stunning special effects. I also love how marvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed. The casting choices were also great. Everyone fits perfectly as the character they were chosen to play. Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and Scarlett Johannson is amazing as Black Widow. My favourite is Samuel L Jackson as the tough but amazing Nick Fury. All in all WATCH THIS FILM.","4/10"

"The Avengers","Patxi_Espanol","14 May 2012","This is the best superhero movie I have ever seen. Full stop. But did you actually read that? Did you get it? This is the best superhero movie I have ever seen.It is about superheroes and it is made with today's technology. Today's technology allows movie makers to design scenes that were technologically impossible before. Any other previous superhero movie I have seen was worse.If you never got into superhero comics then this is not a movie for you.Now back to the summary line. Some (sorry) idiotic reviewers are comparing this movie to: Memento, Blade Runner, Psycho, The Empire Strikes Back, The Matrix, etc. And talking about lack of symbolism, depth, twists, etc. ""This movie doesn't deserve this high rating, etc."" Are you people on drugs?Possible explanations for these 1 star ""punisher"" reviews are: 1 some people just love to hate or 2 they had a bad day or 3 they want to show off their ""expert"" knowledge of ""le cinema"" or 4 they were simply on drugs while watching this movieSo bad news guys: This movie does not have the hyper-realism of ""The Bicycle Thief"", the supreme intrigue of ""Citizen Kane"", the old fashion romance of ""Casablanca"", or the sublime dialogs of ""12 Angry Men"". This is only the best superhero movie I have ever seen.I am 50, I have an engineering degree, my favorite pastime is movies, my favorite genre is Sci-Fi, my favorite movie is Blade Runner and THIS IS STILL THE BEST SUPERHERO COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN (sorry for shouting) and this is why in my review this movie deserves a 9 (not 10 because it is not art).If you want to see an ""artsy"" movie check out ""The Bicycle Thief"" (and take some antidepressants with you). If you want to see what a ""real"" superhero would do see ""Chronicle"" (highly recommended).If you want to see a good comic book adaptation you cannot do any better than this movie","8/10"
"The Avengers","Filmdokter","19 June 2021","#MCUrewatch. Back in 2012 this was a big thing: after their individual films Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America (together with two top assassins) team up to battle Loki and an entire army of aliens. Now we know this was just the beginning of the MCU. It is still one of the stronger films of the franchise out there. The chemistry between those characters/actors works magic. And it is the fun in seeing them both verbally and physically fighting with each other that is the Ace of the MCU and it pretty much started here. It still misses the gravitas some of the later films have (the Coulson drama doesn't really hit off that well). The action is solid and still fresh (back in '12 it was still unique when an entire city was destroyed through superhero fighting). Oh it also features the best turn of Hiddlestone as Loki. All in all still one of the best entrances in the MCU.","10/10"
"The Avengers","3xHCCH","27 April 2012","The anticipation for this film has been building up so many months since the showing of the solo movies about each of the heroes that comprise this superstar group -- Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and finally, Captain America. These individual films were all very good on their own, so very expectations are foisted on this special film that would unite all of them in one big adventure. Even though I am out of town now, that did not stop me from catching this film with some Marvel comics geeks. And for once, a film has come that fulfills it's advanced hype, and then some!The film follows how these heroes were called together and assembled by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve a blue high-energy cube called the Tesseract stolen by the Asgard god Loki. It was fun how the film depicted the clash of their individual big egos of the heroes, and they did not really get along with each other right away, as would be expected. There is humor along with the high-intensity action. I felt though that some ""funny"" scenes involving Tony Stark were too self- indulgent for comfort in a ""team"" film like this.It was great to see all of these heroes get their fair share of screen time, even the lesser known ones, like the super-archer Hawkeye (the very busy Jeremy Renner) and the amazing fighter Black Widow (stunningly portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). The others played their characters as they did in their solo movies, and amazingly, they all worked so well together here: the imperious Thor by Chris Hemsworth, the patriotic Captain America by Chris Evans and the haughty Tony Stark / Iron Man by Robert Downey Jr. People doubted if Marc Ruffalo could take Ed Norton's place as Dr. Bruce Banner and the Hulk, but Ruffalo actually imbued this character with a unique charm previously unseen in other incarnations. The Hulk received the loudest cheers from the crowd! Even the ever-loyal Agent Coulsen (Clark Gregg) gets his moment to shine.This film is a definite must-see not only for all fans of Marvel comics, but for fans of action/fantasy films in general. This is real triumph for director Josh Whedon. ¬†Don't miss the extra scene included in the middle of the final credits for it will surely get you excited.","5/10"
"The Avengers","psavlax","6 July 2012","I always like comic based movies and this one did not disappoint. Much action, which is why I watch these movies. There were plenty of Hollywood retard thinking (which I wont mention so not to ruin the people that are not bother by it). Many funny moments and again lots of action. I would of also like if there had been full movies or some more back story on some of the characters but overall the movie was fun to watch. Great use of computer graphics and great sound track. In addition, the plot was not rich (which I think is acceptable in action movies).Definitely a great movie for anyone that like action flicks.","10/10"

"The Avengers","kuckunniwi","25 February 2013","First of all, let me just establish the follow IMDb film ratings as a reference:A Clockwork Orange: 8.5 - Aliens (1986): 8.5 - American Beauty: 8.5 - Full Metal Jacket: 8.4 - Chinatown: 8.4 - Fargo: 8.2 - Donnie Darko: 8.1 - A Scanner Darkly: 7These are the kind of movies that get (and should get) 8+ ratings. They have real content. They're innovative, original, intelligent and thought-provoking. They're timeless classics.But the comparison may not be too fair, being such different genres. How does it REALLY stand up to Batman Begins (8.3), Watchmen (7.6), or any of the X-Men series, none of which reached and 8? These are all meant to fascinate and woe the same kind of target: comic-book fans, adrenaline-pumped teenagers and action-yearning males. Yet they are aeons away in terms of originality, depth, story and execution from 2012's The Avengers.I don't really have much of a gripe with ""The Avengers"" itself, as after seeing Captain America, I expected nothing more than another formulaic blockbuster. Even so, it's pretty bad even for a fill-in-the-villain/superhero/threat formula movie. A ridiculous super villain, flat characters, no excitement (as you know how things are going to turn out)¬ÖMy disappointment is mostly with IMDb. I'd trusted their rating in the past, but it seems as if that reliability is no longer. Either all the reviews are now being written by 10-year-olds, IMDb users are losing brain cells at an incredible pace, or something's pretty fishy¬Ö.How many reviews that are titled things like ""Awesome! Blew my mind!"", or ""Coolest superhero movie ever!"", that you'd expect to be full of teenage adulation, grammatical mistakes and tons of slang, are actually very articulately written, displaying profound knowledge of script, direction, acting, and character analysis? I thought our education system was going down the drain! Where are all these lucid, eloquent, youths hiding out? And, being so instructed and discerning as they are, why the hell are they giving such a poorly made, mediocre movie such high scores?It looks like the industry's eye has finally set on IMDb's viewer-decanting power, and is corrupting it's authenticity beyond recognition. From now on, I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for real, trustworthy reviews.","3/10"
"The Avengers","pedro_b_g_fontes","25 April 2012","I'm not going to spoil anything or get very technical here. I don't usually write reviews. I did so because this movie took me back to my childhood like no other movie did.Sure, it's not intellectually pretentious or groundbreaking from a cinematic or storytelling point of view, but it delivers perfectly.The wit, conflict, adventure, heart and sense of wonder that I once found in my crazy uncle's attic, slumbering inside those weird looking and dusty Marvel Magazines - populated with super-soldiers, handsome flying scientists, Norse gods, green monsters and incredibly hot chicks in black leather - are here.As I grew up, I somehow repressed the idea that there was no such thing as fictional happiness. These characters will never exist, and it sure takes suspension of disbelief to watch them run about. But this movie reminded me of what they made me feel before girls, party nights, college,taxes and other complicated, serious things came along. As the movie ended, I felt overwhelmed by the readjustment to reality as I knew it in my young adult life.I watched this with my 10 year old nephew. I don't know if that makes me the crazy uncle, but it sure was great to be back in that attic, even for a while. I always knew Hulk smashed. Now I know he always will.","9/10"
"The Avengers","moviedemon","6 May 2012","I know there's comic book fans that have their favorites. There's also the film fans that have their own favorites. There are also some who are so enamored and in love with The Dark Knight that they will pounce on any film that is considered ""better"". For me, I've never been a big comic book guy but I do enjoy a good film adaptation of them. I can love The Dark Knight AND Iron Man. I don't have a bias. I enjoy several of these type of films regardless of the company, brand, or filmmaker. For me, I absolutely love The Avengers. It brought out the little kid in me. At 33, cynical and disgruntled, that's a major compliment. I understand that the film is by no means perfect but it was just so much damn fun. It made me want to buy a costume and play make believe in the backyard again. But again, I'm 33, so I mean that figuratively. I just really had a blast with this and this is the best theater experience I've had since seeing a Star Wars movie. I loved it and can't wait to see it again. So, for those who have hang-ups about how you don't want to hear its better or more popular than this or that, don't get caught up in that nonsense. Who cares where people rank The Avengers or Iron Man or The Dark Knight or what have you? It doesn't matter. So, just do yourselves the favor of seeing this movie. It is just a boatload of fun.","9/10"
"The Avengers","boblipton","15 November 2021","To love movies is to enjoy good movies, no matter how you define them. If there are good movies, there are bad movies. While some people claim to hate CGI, there are those of us who consider it another tool to make a movie, but think it can be misused.I like a lot of superhero movies. I have been enjoying most of the Marvel Studio movies, but some are better than others. It turns out I like the big fight sequence in the first Avengers movie because it clearly takes place around Grand Central. I can relate to it, since I am a native New Yorker. I take pleasure in seeing how the Helmsley Palace tunnels are used, and the Pershing Overpass. The Spiderman movie with the elevated train along Canal Street annoyed me.There are lots of movies that use ""movie geography"" that makes no sense and they don't all use CGI. There was a Michael Keaton vehicle about twenty years ago called THE HARD WAY which annoyed me with its nonsensical geography. The problem is not CGI; It's using CGI or other techniques to enable bad scripts.","9/10"
"The Avengers","fatal_coates","1 May 2012","As AWESOME as expected. An immense lineup/casting, decent story and visuals that put Transformers blur to shame. Iron Man does take a fair chunk of the limelight, as expected (It felt like this was his third film, before that has even been released) but the others do get their fair share and have great entrances.Oh..the movie is very funny!! Iron man starts off initially, but Hulk sees to it, that he gets the last laugh.. and his latter scenes do dominate the tail end (Mark Ruffalo does a pretty decent job) Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye (seen briefly in Thor) makes Oliver's Green Arrow from DC, look pathetic. This movie along with his role in Mission Impossible 4 is definitely a precursor to his taking over the role as Bourne, and he's pumping up for that too.Speaking of the muscles in the film. ""Cap"" appears to have lost weight?? Chris Evans must not be working out as much, but Thor seems to have taken over in the gym as he's even bigger. Hulk is obviously the biggest but thats what CGI does for you.. Oh, and Iron Man appears bulkier?? like his suit needs to compete??! Scarlett Johannsson's ass get's a cameo in this film, I wonder how she felt about the camera's angle in all the 3D glory in one scene..Another new member to the cast, and good to see another Avenger's regular ~ Agent ""Maria Hill"" appears, played by a very fit looking Cobie Smulders (Robin from ""How I met your mother"" fame) She gets a fair chunk of the movie and action herself. Stellan Skarsgaard returns from Thor along with the villain most would have seen in the trailer, Loki. Potts & Coulson cameo.The ""one on one"" battles of many of the heroes is a sight to behold and are really a delight to watch. You get to see them throw everything at each other as you see them match up their strengths and their weaknesses. Also watch for the Cap / Iron Man combo towards the end of the film, memories from the past! Loved the film. Will no doubt be seeing it again.. Check it out!","9/10"
"The Avengers","dannymcdandy","29 April 2012","The Avengers is quite possibly the most anticipated superhero movie in history, but does it quite live up to the hype?I know that this is the Marvel movie we have all been waiting for. This is the movie that all the others made by Marvel Studios has been leading up to. This is what they have been aching to show us.I was pleased to learn that I would be given the chance to see the movie before its May release date in the United States, but despite my privileged opportunity, I went in with relatively low expectations. (It's just another superhero movie, but with a bunch of them at one time, right?)Wrong...If you are a fan of Marvel, superheroes, great CGI or just all-around intense action films, you MUST see Marvel's The Avengers. The CGI was the best I've seen in a long time, the fighting as intense as ever, and the plot is top-notch. But these things aren't the only aspects of the movie that make The Avengers great. For me, it was the characters. Yes, we've seen all these characters before. We've enjoyed their specific movies, but having them on screen together worked better than I could have imagined. In fact, that was why I was apprehensive at first. I had been afraid that perhaps one hero would take away more screen time than another. (We all have our favorites.) But this wasn't the case. Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), provided his much expected wit and humor for the film, causing the crowd to laugh on many occasions. The banter between Stark and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) flowed well and added a lot to the character depth. I wasn't sure how Thor (Chris Hemsworth) would be playing his part either. I thought he actually might be taking too much screen time from the others since his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), was the main antagonist, but this wasn't the case. I found myself most excited in the movie when Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) came on screen. His character was done so well for this movie. I found myself thrilled and even scared in some of his scenes.I must also mention here that Ruffalo did a superb job of taking Edward Norton's place as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. If there's one thing that annoys me about sequels, it's when they change actors, but I actually enjoyed Ruffalo better in this role.Of course you can't forget about Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Each of them played their part of the story wonderfully, though I found Sam Jackson's acting to be a little stale.I would say that if you haven't watched the other movies made by Marvel Studios that you might want to watch them. Most references will be lost on you if you don't. As far as screen time, it felt like every character got their time in the light. No one person stole the show, and just as Marvel intended, they ALL stole the show.There is one particular scene that I enjoyed where the camera panned to each hero, doing their own special moves, though it's hard to explain further than that without giving anything away. However, there were moments in the movie where I had to lean over to my wife and ask what someone was talking about, but these instances were minor.Obviously, if you care anything about Marvel movies, you're already planning to see The Avengers. If you haven't seen any of the other Marvel Studios films, take a weekend, watch them. Then go see The Avengers. I don't think you'll be sorry you did.","7/10"
"The Avengers","bryno92","9 September 2017","This is one of the most overrated movies I have seen. I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I did enjoy Spiderman 1, 2, and 3 as well as Ironman. I've never seen Thor or Captain America so I know I'm missing a little backstory, but I doubt it would add a lot to the experience in this movie. The story was sub-par and very predictable. There is also no sense of danger whatsoever since these superheroes are near invincible, which is why I tend to avoid superhero movies. Action scenes are therefore boring because you know the outcome 99/100 times. I laugh at why they even bother shooting guns at these guys. Do they really expect us to be on the edge of our seats? Yes, the visuals are decent but that's not what makes a movie. When comparing this film to Guardians of the Galaxy, it's no contest. GotG had drama, humor (that wasn't forced), a decent story, and fantastic visuals. If you are a Marvel fan, you will probably like this film simply because you love the characters. I was looking for something other than mindless action and unfortunately I did not get that.","10/10"
"The Avengers","John_T_Chance","26 April 2012","The Avengers is simply a superb movie in every way that matters. Forget comparing it to other films of the genre. I'll save that for a later date because it really isn't important. Judging it as a stand alone piece of entertainment, it's the best time I've had in theaters in a very long time. First off, forget what you think you know or expect because it operates at a higher level then anyone would have guessed. There is very little clich√©d about the film. They establish their own universe by themselves but it is so aided by all the previous solo lead in films. If you've seen them all, you're in for a real treat with Avengers. If you haven't, you'll enjoy them MORE now watching them after Avengers. They fearlessly take the adventure wire to wire but manage to make you really care about every circumstance, character and scene. Every character is believable given the nature of the universe they establish. You really are drawn in to the world and to the each and every character right from the first act. That connection makes the action more meaningful, just like with the best of movies regardless of genre. The dialog has been called superb by fans and critics alike for a reason. The conflict and tension present between EVERYONE (protagonist, antagonist, friend, and foe) absolutely makes the film. The performances that stem off of that are all remarkable. The charisma this film packs, and there's plenty of it, comes from the flawless performances and the dialog. Also, the supporting cast is utilized perfectly. This is as good and as fun of a film that has ever been made. Bold statement, I know. I rarely rely on critics but when nine out of ten of them praise this film they are doing so for a reason. It makes you wonder what those few others saw or how much they were paid not to like an instant classic.","10/10"
"The Avengers","jfarms1956","7 April 2013","This movie is meant for those 8 and up. It is also meant for those who like SciFi Fantasy. The Avengers, a group of single comic book heroes, get together to save the world from Lokki. Samuel Jackson, the head of the Earth's protective forces, plays his role well. The characters are shallow, but let's face it, it's comic book time. It is fast paced and contains interesting toys and gadgets. It works as a great party movie. I loved the sets, the colors, and the characters, all in one film. Thor even comes to the rescue. All in all, the movie is very entertaining and is well worth its greater than 2 hour booty killer time. Get a bowl of pop corn and a group of friends, turn this movie into a SciFi party. I give it 5 thumbs up.","10/10"

How can you expect less from a movie that has Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor in it? It was the perfect blend of drama, action and comedy. Joss Whedon did what, in my opinion, no other director could have done. The pressure and hype surrounding this movie was immense and it delivered in every way.

The script was so cheap and boring and the characters didn't blend with each other at all ..I'm not even impressed by the special effects of the movie .. I think X-Men 3 or Spider Man showed a lot more special effect than this one .. I nearly enjoyed the last scene of the entire movie but this was not enough for such a movie who earned unbelievable high ratings ..Finally, when I knew that the director has never directed such super hero movies and he has only directed for the TV (like Buffy series), I know why this movie sucked !! still can't believe how it got 8.6 really !!","10/10"
"The Avengers","rossiepearson","5 December 2012","""The tesseract has awakened."" spoken in the opening scene, picks right up where 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and 'Thor' left off. S.H.E.I.L.D director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is forced to call upon earths mightiest hero's to stop the self outcast Asgardian Loki.Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, along with Black Widow and Hawkeye, are the only hope to save the world from an invasion, and boy do they in an instant superhero classic. Possibly the best thing about The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble in the UK) is that each hero has grounded powers the exception being Thor (unless you count Hulk's strength as a super power), which makes the Marvel hero's more believable than their DC. counterparts.There's drama, action, comedy, and some amazing CGI, and thankfully doesn't fall into the same category as the not so fantastic Fantastic 4 movies. Mark Ruffalo, replacing the underwhelming Ed Norton, excels as Bruce Banner/Hulk, which is without a doubt the best on screen version of the iconic hero after the awful 2003 'Hulk' movie and 2008's slightly improved 'The Incredible Hulk', as well as Ruffalo and co star Robert Downey Jr. Playing Tony Stark/Iron Man for the 4th time, having some fantastic chemistry in a scene on-board the Hellcarrier.Chris Evans plays Captain America perfectly as the man out of time, Chris Hemsworth is believable in his role as Loki's Brother (like in Thor) Scarlett Johansson is the surprise of the movie though with a lot of the action revolving around her Black Widow, the only major disappointment with The Avengers is that Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is underused. That being said every hero gets decent screen time to justify their appearance as well as everyone having a big part to play in the fantastic final sequence.However, The Avengers towers over every superhero movie in recent memory with the only real challengers being X-Men and The Dark Knight Trilogy, Joss Whedons hit is sure to please Marvel fans and the everyday movie goer. Next up for Marvel studios, Iron Man 3, cant wait.Best quote in the movie: Loki:""How desperate are you that you call upon such such lost creatures to defend you?""If you enjoyed watching: X-Men, Fantastic 4, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Incredible Hulk, you'll enjoy watching The Avengers (Avengers Assemble).","10/10"

"The Avengers","merdiolu","22 July 2012","Actor John Cusack once said that there are no more big production studios anymore. There are just a bunch of banks which provide funding/credits for projects and approve which script would be produced according to box office profit it is projected to generate. ( because Hollywood mentality became like : more money , bigger stars , bigger budget , bigger marketing , bigger blockbuster , bigger box office income that's all it matters ) Since comicbook / superhero genre is the newest and biggest market to be milked in popular culture for Hollywood in these harsh economy ; is it surprising that The Avengers , a childish intake about a bunch of ridiculously costumed ""Superheroes"" with one dimensional immature behavior getting together to repel an alien invasion ( AGAIN ! I think any actual alien seeing these alien invasion movies would not even close Earth ever again. Our ""always winning despite odds"" thing would be silly to them ) ? Unfortunetely not. This is another shallow seasonal product , another ""leave your brain at theater door"" movie aimed for Comic Con Convention fans. And I admit it is a BIG market.Just like most movies in this genre ( there are a few exceptions ) it has its own clich√©'s and tropes like they are coming out of a factory assembly line. At least director Joss Whedon ( a great TV writer/producer. I was a follower of Firefly and Dollhouse ) does not deny them and recognizing what they are , wears them at movie's sleeve. Bickering superheroes ( that's fine amusing with Whedonesque humor but humor got overwhelming and made ""superheroes"" childlike not multi dimensional characters ) , threat from outer space from a sneering arrogant enemy with another comic book costume ( at least Tom Hiddleston performed as well as he could with material he was given , but what the hell was Loki's motivation in conquering Earth ? ) , his boss with a digital voice , super secret ( American as usual ) military spy agency ( I can never understand American film industry's fetish of military - for a nation devoid of conscription ) , national stereotypes ( Russians are evil you know ) , hot ass kicking super agent babes ( Scarlett , Scarlett are you so desperate ? ) , Aryan looking superheroes from WW2 era ( Thor , Captain America , blond blue eyed , with whom we were fighting with anyway in that time ? Did you realize that there were no other ethnicity among these heroes like Oriental or Latin ) , Tony Stark rich jerk , Hulk a Doctor Bruce Banner marked with tragedy ( Mark Ruffolo is the only actor with proper character material and performs admirably in this ) , Hawkeye with baby faced Jeremy Renner ( I never warmed to that guy as an actor ) , and Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury big boss of agency with an eye patch ( no fake protez in nowadays ? ) because it looks cool , a final battle with lots of laser rays and CGI explosions without casualties in another American urban area ( this year it is New York City's trashing time ) , good vs evil , government made the mistake of launching a nuclear missile , it is averted , heroes are victorious blah blah it is the end....After all this sequence of predictable events where no protagonist was harmed and good guys win , what do we have ? An empty blockbuster which will make a big Box Office hit , probably a franchise but at the end an empty film. I can not wait in 20-30 years our grandchildren asking ""Is this the stuff your generation was watching ? No wonder everything really mattered like environment , economy , politics or simple psyche of human or society condition all of them gone hell. Your visual arts stopped reflecting them !""","1/10"
"The Avengers","jackharding89-1","27 April 2012","Consider the wit, brawn and pulse-pounding balls of both Iron Man movies and the spectacular Thor. Now consider the flaws and failings of Captain America, Fury and two incredibly average Hulk flicks. What are you left with? A question: where exactly was in-form writer/director Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble actually going to go? Down the pan? Or through the roof? Well, guess what? He's only gone and pulled it off. Ever since that teasing Nick Fury advent at the end of the first Iron Man, fans and filmgoers alike have been seeing-out the end credits of all subsequent Marvel flicks in hope of something (anything). What they got was everything. All signs pointed to an assemble, all roads lead to an Avengers movie. 5 years in the making? Try 50 for any Marvel mogul worth their salt will tell you a film's been coming since the early 1960's. And here it is: 4 big-buck franchises rolled into one: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk. Robert Downey-Junior, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and...Mark Ruffolo?! Ed Norton obviously didn't fancy this one but fear not, Hulk nuts, Ruffolo's twitchy turn makes for the best Banner yet. Anyway, throw these four in a room together and you're guaranteed two things; friction and fun. Our heroes square up, square off but in the end...well you can guess where it goes. The story? SHIELD head Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) enlists the fickle four along with Black Widow (Scarlet Johanson) to help save the world from Thor's bad brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Zero points for innovation, then. But if you thought Tony Stark suiting-up for the first-time was the coolest thing you've ever seen. Think again. Skilled sci-fi pen-cum-director Joss Whedon has well and truly arrived with this dizzyingly brilliant blockbuster that's more than the sum of it's fluctuating parts. Believe the hype, Avengers Assemble is a cast-iron hit. It's incredible. It's thunderous. It's furious, beaming, biting and marvellous. But enough puns, let's get down to business.Whedon has approached this four-way fusion in the right way: a strong and balanced emphasis on plot, dialogue and visuals, character development and chemistry. Too many cooks? Hell no. The big-name players work so well with one another it's actually surprising. The sheer sum and sense of one-liners and put-downs are just as memorable as the brutal, in-house beat-downs. Which is saying something when you consider scenes pitting Iron Man and Hulk against Thor are enough to send an entire generation of comic-book geeks into cardiac arrest.Downey-Junior's effortlessly cool turn on the sarci' Stark was always going to be the main lure, here, but to say he outshines his peers would be wrong. It's not all about the billionaire ball-buster. Everyone gets their 15 minutes. Both Hemsworth and Ruffolo (in particular) are bang on. Even the out-of-touch Cap' chips in with a few big, cheesy shots and Hiddleston's creepy demigod makes for a sharp villain.Granted, Whedon's tongue-in-cheek ethos and slapstick-like approach means the Avengers was never going to measure up to any of Nolan's Batman films. How many comic-book films (or films, in general) do!? Which is why there's not much point even trying to compare this breath-snatching Marvel muster to Nolan's Dark Knight rebirth. It's a kick-ass popcorn movie for young and old. Nothing more.That said, this hulking 142 minute feature is a stimulating affair with a freehold on the brash and the flash and the down-right hilarious. It's an absolute blast. Wildly entertaining, ridiculously awesome, the Avengers' is everything it should be: over-the-top, funny, cool, funny, loud, exciting, electric and did I mention funny!? Best comic book movie ever? No. Best Marvel production ever? Yeeeeee...no. X-Men: First Class still has that one tied-up but for such a question to prompt a pause for thought says an awful lot. Whedon's Assemble may not be the best superhero film out there but it is the funniest and probably the most entertaining. Definitely the coolest.Sure, there may be a limit to how many times you can watch superheroes kick the crap out of one and all. But you won't mind too much. Popcorn cinema doesn't get much better than this. Joss Whedon and co. have kicked this year's comic-book-busters off with a bang. Expect sequels.","9/10"
"The Avengers","donmurray29","26 April 2012","First of, make sure to see it in 2D not 3D, nice sharp picture in the lovely 2D, all thanks to digital at my Cineworld, this Thursday, not sure why us Brits get this and Battleship ahead of you.Out of the 30 plus films I've seen this year, I really enjoyed this that much that might see it again! A sheer joy from star to finish, and it's very, very funny too, which is good, and very much needed.I'm being vague as I don't want to say anything but see this film, does not matter if you like super heroes or comics, it's just plain fun.The acting, story and script by all is top, and a great villain, which really carries the film. Look forward to Amazing Spiderman now.","9/10"
"The Avengers","williampsamuel","6 December 2014","Between a massive advertising blitz and some none-too-subtle hints that Marvel has been dropping in their films for the last four years, Joss Whedon's Avengers adaptation is one of the most eagerly anticipated blockbusters in recent memory. With most of Marvel's flagship characters- played by some of Hollywood's biggest stars- assembled together in a big budget production co-written and directed by the man responsible for Buffy and Firefly, the premise alone is enough to make fanboys swoon. This is a project with some very high expectations to meet. And having seen it, I for one would say that it has met them.It would not be much of a stretch to say that the Avengers is what every summer blockbuster wants to be. Given a few hundred million dollars and near total creative control, what director wouldn't want to make a film like this. In its two and a half hour running time, it delivers a coherent storyline, several likable, well developed protagonists, and enough action and explosions to show up Michal Bay.I mention this notorious director because his Transformers films, particularly the latter entries, have made millions on the idea that brainless fight scenes, gratuitous pyrotechnics, and more than a little T&A are all it takes to make an action movie; no acting, writing, wit, or originality needed. But Avengers shows that that's not true. Like a certain other superhero franchise due to release its final installment later this summer, Avengers works as much because of its human drama as its action and special effects. One of the main reasons the Fantastic Four movies didn't work, aside from weak screenplays and wooden acting, was that we never bought the idea that the actors on screen were a team. In the first film, they utterly lacked the kind of chemistry that would be expected of friends and co-workers. In the second entry, the chemistry was so forced that they seemed like a sitcom family. Avengers suffers from neither of these problems. Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downy Junior, Scarlett Johansen, Samuel L Jackson, and Mark Ruffalo not only shine on their own, but also work seamlessly together as part of a team, playing of each other's strengths and personalities.Between Stark's cynicism, casual arrogance, and roguish charm, Cap's loyalty and earnestness, Banner's demur, unobtrusive nerdiness, and Thor's zeal and new found humility, all of the leads get the chance to establish themselves as well rounded characters, and to remind us why we liked them in the first place. And like a real team, the characters don't always get along from the moment they first meet. They keep secrets. They question each others' motivations and commitments. They get on each others' nerves. And they certainly let their egos clash. In fact, some of the best fight scenes are between the heroes. But like real people, they put aside their differences and their egos. They learn to trust each other and work together, in a way not nearly as sappy or clich√©d as it suddenly sounds when I'm writing it. The casting of Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury continues to seem like a better and better idea all the time. He might not be able to go all out, what with this being a PG-13 production, but there were moments that, for me at least, very much invoked fond memories of Pulp Fiction. Tom Hiddleston also does very good work as the villainous Loki. His air of condescension and supreme self confidence makes him instantly loathable, and the hint of jealousy and subtle desperation in his voice, together with his piercing, wide eyed stare gives the unmistakable impression that something is definitely not right inside his head. Watching the heroes give him the beating he deserves is a supremely satisfying experience.And like I said, the action is great too. The numerous fights and shootouts are excellently choreographed and filmed, and the climactic alien invasion is stunning in its size and complexity. It's like a non-sucky Battlefield LA, and the cost must have been astronomical. I'm also highly impressed at how long the film was able to keep the action and sense of excitement going. From start to finish, the final battle lasted roughly half an hour, without getting bogged down or becoming overly repetitive.Add in some typically Whedon-esque humor and a fair number of insider references to the comics, Avengers is mighty entertainment, and everything that fans could have hoped for. I look forward to Marvel's inevitable follow-up, and to the director's next project. I don't know why it's taken so long, but Joss Whedon has finally arrived in Hollywood, and I expect to see much more of him in the near future.","4/10"
"The Avengers","Movie_Muse_Reviews","8 June 2012","It has finally been assembled. Marvel's decision to make ""The Avengers"" might seem like the superhero equivalent of the ensemble movie ""Valentine's Day,"" or the theory that stuffing multiple popular actors into one movie is an adequate substitute for storytelling and makes it so marketable that no one could pass it up.While that's not necessarily not true of Marvel's super plan five years in the making, ""The Avengers"" means something more to comic and superhero fans; it is a culmination of a lifetime of anticipation that does in fact have a historical precedent set by Marvel Comics. Essentially, this movie is a collective nerd-gasm, but whether you're part of it or not, there's plenty to love about how geek godfather Joss Whedon tackles this gargantuan task.Still, it's pretty amazing what bundling seven or so of the most beloved comic characters of all time into one package can do when it comes to creating an entertaining diversion. Many folks will nitpick at ""The Avengers"" script from now until eternity, but something needs to be said for the experience of being so awe-stricken that you couldn't care about those things if you tried. There's no shame in covering up ""flaws"" with entertainment, especially when you deliver that entertainment with a level of quality rivaled by few blockbusters of this scale.""The Avengers"" is a near-perfect execution of giving the people what they want. If you had to make a list of what you wanted from an ""Avengers"" movie, Whedon and Marvel would appear to have read your mind. The action sequences blow every previous superhero film out of the air, land and sea, the wit and humor come from more than just a series of punchlines or catch phrases, and all the characters get a chance to shine from an action and development perspective.Story is secondary to achieving those goals. Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) power-obsessed brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has made a deal with an alien race known as the Chitauri to destroy Earth so he can rule it. He breaks into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and steals the Tesseract, an object at the center of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" that has the power to open a gateway through which the Chitauri can invade. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), realizing Earth is about to be at war with an unstoppable force, summons Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), a displaced Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor in hopes they can place nice and band together to stop Loki.So you have high stakes (global destruction), and a force powerful enough to justifiably bring all these heroes together. That's all you really need. The script properly gives each hero reasons to fight and a personal journey, something to overcome. All this for seven characters in a 140-minute runtime. Even though we're building up to yet another movie climax that involves the destruction of a major American city by hostile alien forces, it's still this unique grouping of characters that changes the whole game.As someone who seems to specialize in creating projects that develop cult followings, Whedon was really a perfect choice to write and direct. Despite what one would assume to be a lot of pressure, you never get the sense that ""The Avengers"" is trying too hard. The balancing act of all these characters might have seemed too tall an order for any one man, yet with actors really dedicated to the souls of their characters, Whedon and the cast pack in so much into even the smallest of exchanges.One character the movie excels at in particular is The Hulk. Ruffalo commands the role of Banner as if he was the one who played him in the first two ""Hulk"" features. The script paints him as the team's secret weapon, but also as the most volatile link in the chain. Some fear the green monster, others (Tony Stark) try to provoke him. Either way, despite sharing screen time, this Hulk is both more brutal and emotionally accessible than ever before. More than any other character, you'll end up most curious about what Marvel might do with him next.In general, the lack of time needing to be spent on plot development gets rationed off to all the characters, allowing the third-act action to pay off in more terms than simply eye candy. Each hero has a personal story arc or obstacle to overcome, whether its Tony Stark proving he can set aside his ego or Captain American understanding that he can be relevant in the 21st Century.With so many heroes in one film, Hiddleston had to bear a ton of weight as Loki, creating a presence that could balance out all these good guys. Although not much of a physical threat, his The Joker-like move to allow himself to be imprisoned gives him the fuel to be cunning and unpredictable in performance and in actuality.From a pure entertainment perspective, ""The Avengers"" should be considered king of all superhero movies. What it lacks in thematic and character depth it makes up for with action and humor. Whedon writes so expertly around clich√©s and identifies ways to make the film naturally funny, and the way the action scenes are edited together, there's no confusion in regard to what's going on despite the chaos of the Chitauri invasion scene.Marvel deserves all the credit in the world for building to this point and delivering precisely what fans wanted. Although anyone can enjoy this romp, not just those who saw both ""Iron Man"" films, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America,"" there's no doubt the legwork in those films makes it so much easier to enjoy the entire dynamic of ""The Avengers."" What a momentous achievement from a business, filmmaking and audience perspective.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com","8/10"
"The Avengers","ritera1","24 May 2012","I don't get it.Not that it was a bad movie. It was fun. It was okay.But some surprisingly poor filmmaking. It doesn't help that I loathe hand-held camera. You spend all this money and then muddy up the shots with a hand-held? It's the cancer on the testicles of cinematography. Buy a dolly, or tripod or Steadicam.I'm just glad that I didn't see this in 3D (which is another head-scratcher for me). Stargate or Independence Day was shot better. Any Hong Kong action movie is shot better. Any Jackie Chan movie is shot better.The story was better than average. A good amount of very bad and stilted dialog, though. Loki's ulterior motive on being captured was amazingly transparent.Acting was generally good. I don't know if you call what Downey does as ""acting"". It's him being charming, which works most of the time. But Scarlette? A looker but not getting much better at her ""craft"".And I thought it was just silly to see her face-off with the alien invasion with a handgun.And did Hawkeye's arrows magically replenish themselves 3, 4, 5 times during the final battle? Hemmesworth will be a very good actor in ten years. But he's okay now. But too small to be Thor, though.And please! How was the final battle not a carbon copy of Transformers 3? I liked Serenity. And Cabin in the Woods. But I think Josh was in over his head on this.","9/10"
"The Avengers","Meven_Stoffat","6 May 2012","My inner child is something I value most, and that inner child remembers my days of being a little kid and playing with my Iron Man and Captain America toys, as well as wishing I was the Incredible Hulk. I also remember watching the Hulk cartoons and begging my parents to get me the latest issue of of the next Captain America comic books. So as you can tell, I'm a comic books have played a huge role in my childhood, and that being said, it was with great excitement that I awaited The Avengers. Having seen all the Avengers movies until then and owning them all on blu-ray, I remember even watching them all up until Thursday May 3rd, which was when the midnight premiere took place. My buddy and I even wore Iron Man masks to the screening.I'm most happy to report, to say The Avengers did not disappoint is an unforgivable understatement. It may just be the best comic book movie I've ever seen. It shines dozens of lamps on The Dark Knight and it makes the previous Avengers movies (even Thor, which I loved despite not having been familiar with the Thor mythos before seeing it) look like the Fantastic Four movies.¬†Everything about this movie was pitch perfect. Starting with the script. Joss Whedon had penned the script and it's obvious he has done his homework on not just the mythos and everything else in the world of The Avengers, but also what the audience loves about the heroes and expects from a movie about The Avengers. Everyone was given a sense of humour and played their cards right- Tony Stark was his usual lovable jerk self, and had his typical attitude problems that were hard not to love. He was given a great amount of action as well and the scene near the end where he pushes the nuclear bomb into the portal was purely beautiful intensity. Captain America was his usual kickass self, and every one of his action scenes were hard to not love. Thor was hilarious as well and his scenes with Loki were just amazing. Particularly the scene near the end on Stark tower where he forces Loki to watch the mayhem going on in the city and asks ""Is this what you want?"". Aso, FINALLY the Hulk has had justice done. He's given a sense of humour, which the other movies absolutely failed on. I'm happy to report the movie did not fail there. And who can forget the dialogue? Classic Avengers dialogs, down to the last inch. ""We need a plan of attack!"" ""I have a plan. Attack."" and ""WhTs the matter, not fond of thunder and lightning?"" ""I don't like what comes after.""The characterization is really what counts here too. Obviously if you're going to a movie called The Avengers for a character study you're going to the wrong movie (and you need to lay off the artsy movies too, as they're clearly doing serious stuff to your brain), but for the type of movie it is, it's done supremely well. Each character is unique in their own right- I've already mentioned the eponymous superheroes, but Black Widow is one sexy and fun character that's hard not to love. Her action scenes are just incredible and her backstory, while thankfully kept to a minimum is interesting as hell. Hawkeye is stone cold and scary in the first half when ¬†possessed by Loki, then is cool and badass near the end when he resides to kick some Loki butt.¬†The movie is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen thanks to lots of clever, Whedonian humour and appropriately placed Comic book style exaggeration. The scene where Hulk smashes Loki around like a rag doll made me laugh harder than anything in 21 Jump Street and any other comedy this year. And the scene where Hulk sucker punches Thor!The performances are amazing as well. Pure commitment from all involved, with Downey Jr., Evans and Hemsworth, as well as Johannson, Smulders, Jackson, Hiddleston and Renner giving amazing performances all, but Ruffalo is the real surprise here. He brought something new to the table here as Hulk- every line he spoke sounded like he was trying hard to hold back his inner monster and boy was it chilling. His monologue about how he tried committing suicide was delivered very chillingly beautifully. He was the biggest surprise and got everything about the Hulk perfect. Props to Ruffalo for FINALLY getting The Hulk exactly right!!!I'm going to conclude my review with one more little piece of praise. Whedon is my favourite TV writer And he's managed to make me proud to be a comic book nerd. Justice was done to the best superheroes ever and I can tell superhero movies are going to not be the same ever again. A big thanks to Ll involved for the commitment and true dedication to making this movie possible, and the great success it was. I've seen this movie twice already and I can't wait to see it again and again. Now I've only got two more words to say: AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!","9/10"
"The Avengers","achyutha037","27 April 2012","I was eagerly waiting for this movie. But after seeing the Marvel movie, Captain America: the first Avenger, Thor and Incredible hulk- I thought that the movie would be not as good as the hype it carried for so many years. But still due to Robert downey jr. i wanted to see this film. OK, i admit it, i was blown away by the movie in terms of Action, and of course Humor. Director Joss Whedon, directed this movie so BRILLIANTLY, that there are very little or NO flaws. Sufficient Screen time has been provided for each of the SUPERHEROES. but the Mighty guys, Iron man(RDJ) and the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) steal the show. Thor(Chris Hemsworth) was too, brilliant. In this movie, you'll see more of Captain America(Chris Evans) than his solo movie, which is really great. AND, Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson) kicks the ass off whoever she fights with. Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) is not at all Underused, his Powers were shown superbly. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) was great with his Initiative. And here it is, the main villain, Loki(Tom Hiddleston), steals the show with his mischievous and No-worries personality, he fits into the role perfectly. On the Whole, the cast were perfect, with each of them fitting into the characters with ease.The humor and witty one liners are splendid. Don't expect it to be DARK with no humor like the Dark knight, instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the film in the auditorium. Many people have started comparing Avengers with The dark knight, but what I SAY is these two are COMPLETELY different type of film, and comparing the two is not justified. Still if you compare, Avengers is better than Dark knight. Due to the reason that Avengers can be enjoyed by each and every person, it has action and Humor, both at equal Quantities.As for iron man, Robert downey jr IS Iron man, no other person can do that role so perfectly. Unfortunately, RDJ is about to leave the franchise after IRON MAN 3, i request the iron man fans to please him not to leave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films, including AVENGERS 2. :)I will ensure to each and every person who is reading this that, this film will never disappoint you, not even a moment. 100%. :) Go watch it without doubt. I will say that, this movie will definitely touch or cross the 1Billion mark and becomes on of the highest grossing films in the film history. Verdict: 10/10 stars, A+++++, EXCELLENT.","8/10"
"The Avengers","Top_Dawg_Critic","11 July 2017","One would expect putting an all star cast - all in their best Superhero roles, you would have a conflict for acting supremacy.

"The Avengers","Thanos_Alfie","11 February 2022","""The Avengers"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch the mightiest heroes of Earth come together in order to defend it by Loki (Thor's brother) and his alien army. They have to fight as a team if they want to win and save humanity.I liked this movie very much because it was the first movie that many of the Marvel heroes that we had already watched their films came together and formed The Avengers. It contained plenty of action scenes, the plot was very interesting and it also contained some unexpected plot twists that made it even more interesting. In addition to this, the direction which was made by Joss Whedon was very good and he did an excellent job on the way he combined all these amazing heroes. The interpretations of Robert Downey Jr. Who played as Tony Stark, Chris Evans who played as Steve Rogers, Chris Hemsworth who played as Thor, Scarlett Johansson who played as Natasha Romanoff and Mark Ruffalo who played as Bruce Banner were very good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Avengers"" is a nice, entertaining movie to spend your time with and I am sure it will amaze you.","2/10"
"The Avengers","kevinxirau","7 May 2012","Wow, it has finally arrived. Marvel has had one hell of a project, coming up with movies exploring the origin stories of some of the most iconic superheroes of all time while adding small but subtle connections to each other as a way to show fans what is coming over the horizon. The result is an all-out marvel mash as Earth's mightiest heroes have come together to face a threat no one hero could possibly face alone. They are the Avengers.Loki, the god of mischief, has come to conquer the Earth with an unspeakable alien force to back him up. To make matters worse, he has obtained an ancient artifact with virtually limitless power as his disposal. In desperation, Nick Fury, director of the peace-keeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., assembles together the greatest heroes the world has ever seen: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Incredible Hulk. If these extraordinary independent individuals can learn to work together, their combined might be enough to conquer this global threat.This is every comic book geeks dream team and dream movie. The faces we have all grown up with and come to love finally together in one film. Normally, such a task is highly risky because not only do the filmmakers have to be faithful to the comics, but also appeal to what the fans would want to see in The Avengers, not to mention avoid any plot holes. Thankfully, this movie does it all plus more. It is, dare I say it, incredible! The action scenes are some of the best in the superhero genre, lots of shooting, punching, and, of course, smashing. Things get really insane and everything in sight gets totally destroyed as the forces of good and evil duke it out. All the characters have practically equal back story, interactions, and amount of fighting, even characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. With this, not one seems left out or doesn't get enough of these elements. Dialog is written very well and there's a surprising amount of comedy throughout the film (and it's hard not to laugh with it). There's lots of great moments and none of it seems the least bit corny.In conclusion, this will satisfy anyone, especially the fans. Everything people hope to see is brought to life and it kicks serious butt. With fantastic action scenes, excellent special effects, well-written script, cool music, and surprisingly great comedy, The Avengers is sure to satisfy in every way. On a scale of one to ten, I would give this movie a twenty (it's a shame I can't physically give such a rating)! Go check out this awesome flick and enjoy! AVENGERS, ASSEMBLE!","10/10"

"The Avengers","Eternalkid","15 July 2012","I felt compelled to review this, having just seen it 2 months after its release - the wait was agonising at times, but worth every second! Very few films have made me beam and laugh and cheer and clap so much. Terminator 2. Batman Begins. Iron Man. And a select handful of others.The Avengers is a little bit of a slow burner, but with delightful ingredients on the screen, it makes for a fabulous, explosive and tasty finish.I'd have to say, it was superbly orchestrated from start to finish, and the highlights must go to the Thor/Iron Man scuffle, and the grand finale which has - surprisingly - The Hulk as its main and certainly best attraction. After two average Hulk films, THIS one more than compensates for them, with humour (""I'm always angry"") and punchiness (it stopping one of the megamonsters and slapping Loki around as it he were a Barbie doll - awesome!).Other highlights are the Cap telling the NYPD what to do and Loki's masterful interrogation by Romanoff.All in all, the best action I've seen in a few years. Cannot wait for them coming up against Thanos in AV2!","3/10"
"The Avengers","kosmasp","7 June 2012","I'm still having my fingers crossed that the Avengers will overtake Avatar as the most successful movie ever (until another movie burst and takes over that is). It would be such a great success and I would be so happy for Joss Wheddon. A real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time. As we speak Avengers has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll. And all that is more than deserved. While I don't think it is necessary to have watched the other Marvel movies so far (especially not the different Hulks), the Avengers will make you want to watch more (look at your local video store for confirmation!).All the characters are here and have their moments. Maybe Thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise. But then again, he is god, so he wouldn't care anyway. Mark Ruffalo is winning (as a Charlie Sheen would say) with his performance as Hulk/Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is entertaining as ever. And even if some claim that Captain America is not needed, I think he brings Gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an Iron Man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole Crew. Chris Evans is perfect for that role.The movie has been criticized for the weak villain. I think that does injustice to the movie. While the characters (bar Hulk?) have been introduced to you, this still is a forming of a group. It is more about the Avengers, than it is about any villain. And I don't think Tom H. Loki is that weak (even if Hulk does disagree).I watched the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Time flies by and you don't realize how fast 150 minutes can go by. I like the fact, that Joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid. So maybe some will not get the joke/bet between Capt. Americas character and Sam Jacksons character (though I reckon it won't be many), but I loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of it.Since this is a Marvel movie, you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end. A friend of mine knew immediately what (or rather who) we saw there. You'll find the answer on the internet. That scene came in between the credits. There is another scene after the credits which as of yet, was not shown in Europe, but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release (DVD, Blu Ray or whatever comes next). I'm so looking forward to it ... oh and the 3D is nice, but its the story/characters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ...","7/10"
"The Avengers","atcshane-1","20 June 2012","Before I went to the movie I was shopping for Tshirts online and found one that looks like the NASCAR symbol... You know the one--it looks like the word NASCAR in motion with a bunch of colors coming off the left side like its a car I guess. Anyway, someone made a Tshirt that looks identical but instead of NASCAR it says BORING. Lol.Anyway, flash forward to me falling asleep in the movie, butt numb, and I keep picturing that Tshirt. Boring. This movie. Really boring.I think I fell asleep 3 times, for about 15 minutes total. Its hard to sleep too long because every now and then there is an explosion or some other loud whammo.The Dark Knight was WAY better than this. Spiderman was WAY better than this.Is it worthy of 1 star? No. Maybe it should be 3 or 4... But I'm giving the 1 to help offset some of the insane 10s I'm seeing on here. Seriously, there are people on IMDb saying its the best movie they have ever seen in their life. Really? Really!? Really. O.o I smell something fishy going on around here.The movie was completely vapid, boring, convoluted. Nothing about the movie was new or interesting.I'm assuming the score has been manipulated by social media, hopefully IMDb will do something about it. I look forward to seeing the score drop consistently for years to come, once whoever/whatever is driving this fake voting moves onto a new project.","9/10"
"The Avengers","sauravjoshi85","27 February 2020","The Avengers is a superhero movie directed by Joss Whedon and stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans,Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston,Clark Gregg, Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Samuel L. Jackson.What to expect when six powerful superheros comes together for a similar purpose of saving earth and mankind? The answer is simple action, action and action.The best part of the movie is it's tight screenplay which will make you glued to the screen, with lots of high octane drama, fights, bullets and bombs to give the movie a larger than life effect.Robert Downey Jr. is charismatic as always, Chris Hemsworth and Evans does their job with perfection, The beautiful Scarlet Johansson is as dangerous as the superheros, Jeremy Renner leaves impression with his gray shaded character and Mark Ruffalo 'The other guy' is also impressive. But not to forget Tom Hiddleston the only bad guy stands tall in the group of powerful superheros.This is one of the best superhero movie which highlights the characters of all the superhero nicely and will leave you spellbound.","7/10"
"The Avengers","aharmas","6 May 2012","If there's a genre that's evolving and becoming better and better in the last decade, it's the adventure/comic genre; not solely a result of better CGI and cinematographic techniques, but there is also much better writing and acting, and in previous years, efforts by Nolan and Joe Johnston have been bypassed by critic and association entities because they are not a specific type of picture. It is certainly my hope this brilliant film doesn't suffer the same fate for it's great cinema all the way.With a superb cast that appears to embody each of the super heroes, and most intriguingly, their own stunts, we are treated to a very exciting two hours plus at the movies where the Earth is once again in danger of being overcome by an alien race, and somehow, story lines from several films are tied together neatly. Eventually, they all become a cohesive whole, and the results are MARVELous!! The film is terrific, and it might not reach the levels of perfection that we saw in ""The Dark Knight"", a movie so magnificent in its structure and sustained by terrific writing and acting. There's certainly no villain like the Joker here, but the evil forces are sufficient enough to warrant a cry for help, so that we need our heroes to come and kick some alien butt. It's definitely a showcase for all involved: Renner, Downey (much warmer) than in any of his previous turns as Ironman, Johanssen is magnificent, Evans is fantastic, Hemsworth is royal like in his turn, but the best turn out there is sheer force of nature that Ruffalo gives to the Hulk. He certainly walks away with the picture, yet everyone else gives him plenty of competition for the spotlight.The film is a crowd pleaser, with plenty of terrific set pieces, leading to an extraordinary third act, a piece of cinematic action rarely seen before, where every element moves so smoothly, it can make your heart soar when you see what really good films can achieve. It certainly doesn't remind me of some of the films that have been recognized in the last decade, as the best that cinema can offer. Good film do not have to be serious; they have to be well made, regardless of what the subject matter is, and ""The Avengers"" once have proved just how amazing solid script writing (by one person, not a whole team of creative ideas) can give you when you combine with top of the line special effects. It's truly a joy to see Jackson sharp tuning a role we have seen before, but it's now full of pizazz.There are some terrific possibilities coming our way later this year, and I am looking forward to the amazing offerings by Nolan, Scott, and Sonnenfield, but they have a battle uphill trying to match this wonderful movie. Watch, learn, and learn to give credit where credit is due. This is cinema at its best.","1/10"
"The Avengers","joshua-303-92778","21 August 2012","Of all the recent Marvel movies which led to this film, I thought Thor was pretty decent, and the rest were blah. ""Avengers"" is arguably the worst yet.The film reminded me of Transformers 3, with constant explosions and destroyed buildings, as well as ubiquitous 3D scenes which actually don't look very realistic. This movie is a gimmick.The plot is utterly clich√© and haphazard. The dialogue, save for a few funny lines, is very bad. No great acting except for Loki, and he seems out of place among wooden performances. Even the editing was pretty lazy. This ""movie"" seems more like a TV serial with forced dialog.The entire film is basically just a vehicle to watch the different heroes fighting with each other.","10/10"
"The Avengers","lukem-52760","19 August 2019","Avengers Assemble is a big budget summer blockbuster that's action packed & perfectly cast, it's so Awesome to see these heroes we all grew up loving on screen together in a big adventure fantasy Thriller!!!Avengers has the right amount of seriousness & light humour, the action scenes are Awesome!!!
It's amazing seeing Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron man together fighting side by side & we also have the Awesome Hawkeye & Black Widow joining the fight.The cast is excellent, we have the legendary Samuel l Jackson as Nick Fury the guy who Assembles the Avengers when a threat against earth rises.
Chris Evans is perfect as Steve Rogers aka Captain America he's my favourite of the Avengers team & one of my favourite Marvel characters ever along with The Punisher & Daredevil.
Evans has the perfect balance of lost & weary old school soldier & also in control tough & confident leader when needed, he's a fantastic complex character.
The whole cast is perfect though, Thor is fun, tough & loyal & that's down to a great performance from Chris Hemsworth!!!
Robert Downey Jr is perfect as rich guy super hero Iron man, he's playful, funny & super smart it's a fantastic performance.
Mark Ruffalo is excellent as the big mighty incredible Hulk, another perfect performance bringing nice guy scientist Bruce Banner to life & the big green beast within.
The absolutely beautiful Scarlett Johansson is outstanding as extremely tough & super smart Black Widow, she's extremely Dangerous & extremely brave.
Also we have the excellent marksman Hawkeye played perfectly by Jeremy Renner who is probably my 2nd fave character after Captain America, Hawkeye is a Cool, tough & loyal warrior.
This first Avengers film is truly OUTSTANDING!!!
A big piece of pure fantasy entertainment & a near perfect super hero film.
Director Joss Whedon is a Genius, he writes this BRILLIANT stuff & directs it.","9/10"
"The Avengers","The_Dead_See","11 May 2012","I'm not the biggest fan of the setup movies for The Avengers. I think they're tremendously hit and miss, and not through some comic book fan need for accuracy but as stand alone films on their own merits. See, I like the odd comic book, but I'm certainly not a comic book fan. What I am a fan of is good, solid storytelling. You know - characters that evolve, logically sound motivations and tensions, good pacing, an antagonist defeated through skill rather than luck - that sort of thing. From this perspective, the setup movies fell mostly flat for me. Iron Man was fabulous fun but it's sequel was poor. The Hulk was meh. Captain America spent far too long without any actual Captain America in it, and Thor - hmmm was just a bit of an all round mess and lacked even eye candy set pieces to elevate it. So back a few years ago when it first became whispered in nerd circles that The Avengers was going to surface to tie all these movies together, I didn't really get much of a sense of excitement. A few years later, as the end credits rolled on Thor, I pretty much made up my mind that The Avengers movie was going to screw up badly. If the industry couldn't pull off a good movie with just one hero in it, how could they ever pull off one with six?Then I heard that Joss Whedon was writing and directing and my interest rekindled. After all, I've seen him handle symphonies of characters before - with the Scooby Gang and the Serenity crew. If anyone could do it, Whedon could.But still I was wary. Just didn't want to let my expectations get too high - superhero movies are notoriously difficult to get right after all. Maybe even Whedon would screw it up.Boy was I wrong.I don't think I've had this much fun at the cinema in years. Since the first Matrix movie in fact which was, what? Twelve years ago? (God I'm old). The Avengers had everything a good popcorn flick needs - major action setpieces, beautiful sfx, some neat and effective humor, yada yada yada. But none of that is what left my jaw on the floor. What really blew me away - and what compelled me to come here and write the first review I've done on IMDb in quite some time (years probably) - was just how perfectly done the script was. Every character is given their moment to shine, every interaction is perfectly in tune, this whole movie was the audiovisual equivalent of listening to a perfectly wrought symphony. Every moving part clicked into place so well that you couldn't have taken out one single character - not even the arguably 'second tier' characters of Hawkeye and the Black Widow - without the whole thing coming apart. This is no Batman or Pirates of the Caribbean, or Spider Man movie; because while those multi-protagonist movies were all quite adequate and entertaining, the characters and plots were often an out of focus mess. Not so in The Avengers. Everything clicks so perfectly I can't even find the words to describe it. You'll just have to go see it for yourself to see what I mean.","8/10"

"The Avengers","Leofwine_draca","12 January 2015","I'm not really a comic book fan, so after hearing the constant hype about this film for a couple of years I really wasn't too fussed when it finally appeared on TV. I went into it expecting not to like it much, and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy, a whole lot of posturing, and a silly storyline involving silly characters.Then things changed. They started to pick up, and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour, an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant, wide-scale mayhem, but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory.And yes, I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like, really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure, I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing, overblown CGI mayhem, replete with a silly, buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride.","10/10"
"The Avengers","filmfan1991","26 August 2012","One simple word AMAZING. everything from past MARVEL movies since Iron Man have led up to this great crossover movie with great heroes such as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk and others.

The characters are great abound with great acting from great actors like Robert Downey, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johanson, and Samuel Jackson.

None of the actors seemed to have to make much effort, probably because the script and plot were pretty much irrelevant.","8/10"
"The Avengers","neil-476","27 April 2012","Having cracked the problem of super-hero movies with successful runs on Spider-Man and X-Men (both franchises contracted out to major studios), Marvel went independent with assorted features based on their lesser known characters - Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - and did very well with a series of one-off movies which were commercially and critically well received. Importantly, these movies were conceived, from the very start, as essential building blocks moving towards this film, which achieves a cinematic first by bringing together a number of characters who have headlined their own movies and who now appear together (OK, so I'm ignoring Abbott and Castello's role in bringing together Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman. So sue me).The problem was always going to be how to deal with bringing together such powerful characters in a team movie when every one of them is a strong enough character to have carried his own movie - surely either they are all downgraded to sidekicks of each other? Or else the movie will be nothing but a testosterone-fulled p*ss*ng contest? It turns out that it is both these things, but the mix is beautifully judged. By entrusting the script and direction to Joss Whedon - ace script doctor, master at working with ensemble pieces, and lifelong comic lover (and excellent comic writer, one might also add), the balance - for balance was always going to be critical in this movie - is perfect.I won't say anything very much about the content, because there is so much in this movie to enjoy. It is simply full of small touches among the bombast, which will bring delight to the average viewer who likes an action-packed blockbuster, and absolute joy to comic lovers. The characters which have been established in the previous movies are all here, and they are all the same people - they haven't been changed for The Avengers, but they have more depth and there is also character development here. The script is terrific and the action is stunning. Oh, and hang on until after the main titles have finished at the end...By the way, thank you so much for saddling this movie in the UK with the ridiculous title ""Marvel Avengers Assemble"" (which communicates even less to a non-comics audience than ""The Avengers"") and also depriving us of the iconic Avengers logo and title on the main title screen.","5/10"
"The Avengers","Bascoda","26 May 2012","OMG Scarlett Johansson looks good in tight black pants!! OK, enough of that. This is as good a translation of comic book to film as any of us are likely to see - ever. Each of the actors chosen for the roles draws their character on like a glove, and the fit is perfect. This is what separates The Avengers from most other movies in this genre - the characters have depth, their interaction with each other is real and eminently believable, and the willful suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy this type of movie is so effortless as to be unnoticeable. The CGI effects are spectacular, as is to be expected, and kudos to the designers for some really over-the-top bad guys and hardware. If I have one minor quibble, it is that I wanted more from Colbie Smulders as agent Hill. Her screen presence is so intense that I kept waiting (and wanting) more from her than to just be Samuel Jackson's aide-de-camp. Ah well, maybe next time.","9/10"
"The Avengers","mounirrmaged","10 August 2016","The avengers. One of the most hyped comic book movies of all time. After years of build-up with solo movies, the avengers is born. Is it good? does it still hold up? the answer is no. I admit, the first time i saw this movie in theaters, i was having a blast and enjoying it very much. However, the film gets worse for me each time i give it a second watch. The film is centered around Loki(played by Tom Hiddleston), who wants to take over the world, while the avengers work out their ways to stop him. It is as generic and lazy as it sounds. The film barely has any story or even character development/interaction. It's nothing but one liners and action. None of the characters have a defined personality. Tony Stark is a one dimensional clown, Thor is has the charm of a wood that speaks in a Shakespearean way, black widow and hawkeye are nearly the same, only their gender are different. Hulk has his moments, and captain America is one of the most boring comic book characters i have ever seen in this movie. It's basically a Michael Bay movie minus the women objectifying, but same level of obnoxious and out dated film making. One of the most overrated trash movies i have ever seen. This movie gets 3/10 from me","7/10"
"The Avengers","paul_haakonsen","18 August 2012","First of all I must admit that I am not much particularly a fan of superheroes in general, but I have seen the movies leading up to this, simply because they were available and I had the time. And I had read up on the hype around this movie, so I might as well give it a go as well.And as a fairly non-superhero kind of guy, well I must say that ""The Avengers"" was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie. The story was, for me at least, rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal. Sure, it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior movies.The effects in ""The Avengers"" were top notch, as to be expected from a movie of this caliber. Lots of really great effects and visuals. However, when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly, I was ready to turn off the movie. That was just silly. But I decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scene.However, one thing did make me wonder, with all the destruction in New York, you didn't see a single civilian getting hit or killed in any way, that was just stupid, especially with so many people living there. In fact, you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie, which was sort of lame.Another thing puzzled me, when Bruce Banner turned into The Hulk for the first time in the movie, he was out of control, smashing everything and everyone in sight. But somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time. That just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformation.And as with the previous Marvel movies with these characters, they had some great performances to the movie. I think that it was actually Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the most.""The Avengers"" was good entertainment, even for an anti-superhero guy like myself. Great action. Lots of destruction. And great special effects.","1/10"
"The Avengers","cidliq","6 July 2012","THE GOOD- I was truly impressed with how well they pulled this movie off. The visual effects were all very clean. The characters were portrayed by the actors very well. This movie was loaded with action keeping everyone's attention glued to it. I was so impressed, I went to the theater to see it more than once and recommended it to everyone. I was very happy to see most of the actors return to portray their characters in this. THE BAD- Most characters.... The hulk was my big issue here. Mark Rufflo was good with the Bruce Banner character but the graphics for the hulk just did not meet the level of the movie starring Edward Norton. But it was not so bad that I could not look past it and really find enjoyment. I will most definitely go see another installment of Avengers.","9/10"
"The Avengers","gavin6942","17 March 2013","Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.I want to first address the IMDb rating on this film. Currently, it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now, no matter how good you think it is, does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean, really? I grew up reading comic books, so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base, which is good, because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is, for example, it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities? Particularly the Hulk, who is not a team player. This was addressed.","9/10"
"The Avengers","wuytskristof-823-169489","13 September 2012","I heard people call The avengers a tour de force, a perfect box-office bonanza, the wickedest ride of their lives and best movie ever! I can only assume that every single one of them is a comic book freak and are all obsessed by every Marvel hero and villain. I can tell you I'm a movie buff but I'm not a comic book freak. In my opinion that shouldn't matter because dark knight for instance, is one of my favorite movies of all time. I know it's not from Marvel but DC comics but I also liked the first iron man movie (he turned into a narcissistic bastard after the first and I didn't like that character development) So I'm not gonna write a movie off just because I'm not a huge Marvel fan.But after 2 1/2 hours of sitting through the deluge of explosions, ""witty"" banter, and generic story-telling. I was happy the movie ended, all around me there were people applauding and telling each other what an awesome movie they just saw. My plan was just to go home and put on a real movie. With plot twists and character development, both things I missed in the avengers. You could say it's fast paced but if the story doesn't grab you by the balls, it's all irrelevant. The only thing the movie had going for itself was that it was hilarious, too bad it didn't mean to be.I knew after five minutes that the movie wasn't going to live up to the hype. And it was only downhill from there to be honest. The last sequence was the worst in my book. The alien invasion was so stupid, we were all wondering what was going to come through the black hole. And what came to wipe out all of humanity? A few hundred Chitauri, wow... is that an invasion? Six avengers got their stuff together and mobbed the floor with them. That was a huge anti-climax!I think this movie is very overrated and only worth a view if you're tired and want some brainless 'entertainment', other than that it really is only for the comic book geeks. And maybe teenagers who've been brainwashed with years of Asian (fighting) cartoons. Oh yeah, the movie I watched when I got home was snatch!","8/10"
"The Avengers","DICK STEEL","30 April 2012","Although if I may add a little personal bias here, The Avengers is perhaps the Hulk movie that never got made until now, leaving the other two films starring Eric Bana and Edward Norton biting the dust. When Mark Ruffalo was announced as taking over the mantle of the gamma powered being with anger management issues, I'm sure many like myself would have been bewildered, but Ruffalo shows why he's the best Hulk just yet, and is a mean Bruce Banner as well. We get back to seeing Banner being a scientist, enlisted not for his raging abilities, but that of being the go to expert on gamma radiation. That doesn't mean he's a pushover when it comes to the crunch, and with Ruffalo being motion captured rather than having the Hulk purely CG, is something different, not to mention the countless of cool scenes the big monster gets himself into thanks to his powered abilities. In short, it's almost Hulk 3: Hulk and Friends instead.But I digress. The Avengers finally made it to the big screen after all those stingers in the various Marvel movies gave audiences a tease for years. The wait is over, and boy, was it worth the wait. We welcome back the familiar faces in Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), as well as the SHIELD agents in director Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Coulson (Clark Gregg) and new addition Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), as well as bit roles to others such as Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Jarvis (Paul Bettany), Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) stringing all of them into a fit as the villain hell bent on enslaving all of humanity, with help from an alien race army of course. Talk about an ensemble cast!And true to form, Joss Whedon devotes adequate time to almost all of the Avengers, and making this more like an extension of their individual films as we dwell a little bit more into the background and issues each hero face, some which we know of from their earlier arcs that thankfully don't get rehashed too much save for certain quick montage sequences. Tony Stark has just about finished his research on renewable energy, not forgetting a new version of his armour that we'd get to see here (the Mark VII), Captain America still finding his feet in the real world and showing shades of the leader he's growing into, and Thor continuing his bickering with half brother Loki that culminates into having him being sent back to Earth to take his villainous brother back to Asgaard once again. The quieter moments in the film provides plenty of opportunity for characterization, and Whedon doesn't disappoint in showing how well he's comfortable and knowledgeable about each one of them from comic folk lore.And when it comes to what fan boys all over the world are clamouring for, Whedon doesn't disappoint when it comes to larger than life action that pits the Avengers either against each other, playing into the hand of Loki in his divide and conquer strategy, and when they finally get their act together to cooperate and save the world. The Team Ups here, either in twos or threes, is fun in every essence of the word, pitting each hero against each other, or when cooperating to address problems that require their unique, combined abilities. And there's always good natured humour around the corner when you least expect, some really taking you by surprise, yet is still keeping true to the nature of each character. If you'd think the bulk of the wisecracks come from Stark, well, think again!Whedon also makes it a conscientious point never to rehash what had already been seen in the individual movies, but providing a lot more and expanding the scope from what had been done before. I assure you that you'd haven't seen the Hulk do battle like what he does here, easily becoming a fan favourite and stealing the thunder from the rest, and of course a lot more from Captain America whose own film saw a limited variation in his fighting abilities, as compared to what he finally does here. Thor with Mjolnir is another dimension and class altogether, while Hawkeye finally saw some battles of his own after his short cameo appearance in Thor where he didn't fire a single projectile. The biggest challenge and change of course was on Tony Stark, and it would be interesting to see if this change, about being less egoistical and self-centered, would translate into his next film as well. The final battle that took at least half an hour of screen time, is the Avengers comic book come alive in larger than life spectacle that's best seen in the IMAX 3D format.So what's next? Iron Man 3 will blast off and be first off the blocks, then there should be another Captain America film that will showcase more of SHIELD. I guess maybe either Thor or Hulk may make a big screen return next, before getting everyone together again for another hurrah, hinted upon midway through the end credits, but which was mentioned would be a smaller film than this one. Let's wait and see, but in the meantime, get out there and enjoy this one heck of a ride! Definitely a film that fans of either hero will find irresistibly awesome and in a league of its own. More please!","10/10"
"The Avengers","Troy_Campbell","26 April 2012","Four years ago Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury appeared in Iron Man's end credit scene and whipped the comic book geek-world into a frenzy; it was a hint at larger things to come within the Marvel universe and the fans knew it. Since then we've witnessed a franchise (including The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America) that has excelled in self-referential plugs, character cameos and plot crossovers, all building a giddy excitement towards the main show: The Avengers. It was worth the wait.Writer-director Joss Whedon has concocted a perfect blend of mouth-watering action, laugh-out-loud humour and eye-blistering CGI. Whether it's the excellent Thor vs Iron Man vs Captain America rumble in the forest, the mind-boggingly spectacular 30 minute finale in downtown Manhattan, or any scene with the Hulk, the bruising action is choreographed and executed with a flair not seen in any of the aforementioned standalone movies and, along with the series' best CGI, is likely to have your jaw on the ground. Similarly, the script and dialogue is crafted with such a high level of intelligence and wittiness that every joke hits the mark ‚Äì the Hulk's reaction to Loki belittling him had me in tears ‚Äì and the story roars along at a cracking pace, allowing you to glide over the minor gaps in plot. However, perhaps Whedon's most amazing feat is how he balances the screen time among the mammoth cast (who continue their great work from the franchise's previous instalments); he has kept every character in focus, yet never over-shadowing the others, resulting in an ensemble piece that clicks from the get go. The opening act may be a tad slow, but this superhero adventure is a rollicking good ride with genuine awe-inspiring moments. Bring on the sequel.","9/10"

"The Avengers","JaviSanchez5833","14 January 2023","The Avengers is a film that truly exceeded all of my expectations. From start to finish, it is a non-stop action-packed adventure that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film brings together some of the biggest and most iconic characters in the Marvel universe, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk, and pits them against the powerful villain Loki and his army of aliens.One of the things that makes The Avengers such a great film is the incredible cast. Robert Downey Jr. Once again delivers a fantastic performance as Iron Man, bringing the character's wit and sarcasm to life. Chris Evans also shines as Captain America, perfectly capturing the character's sense of duty and integrity. And Mark Ruffalo completely owns the role of the Hulk, giving the character a new level of depth and complexity.The script is also top-notch, with clever and witty dialogue that keeps the film from ever feeling stale. The pacing is also spot-on, with the film never feeling too slow or too fast. And the special effects are absolutely breathtaking, with the battle scenes in particular being absolutely stunning.Overall, The Avengers is a film that is not to be missed. It is a perfect blend of action, humor, and drama, and it is one of the best superhero films ever made. I give it a 10/10, and I highly recommend it to any fans of the Marvel universe or anyone who just loves a great action film.","6/10"
"The Avengers","AngelHonesty","16 August 2023","I think this movie will always have a bench mark for Marvel MCU. Finally for the first time, they all come to together. The movie did an amazing job at uniting these characters and the team. Especially since the individual films all had their own style and feel. I love how they keep everyone one to their truest form. The story flows perfectly and feels right. The cast is like a well fit puzzle, they all glow, no one gets shoved aside and no one stands out more than the other, they're all great. The comedy was top-notch, I loved the mixture of action, heart and funny scenes, the movie was perfectly balanced. And above all they finally did the hulk justice. Mark Ruffalo is the hulk. He's perfect for it. They wrote his script so cleverly and the hulk himself is just down right cool. For the first time we really get to see SHIELD in its full glory. When watching all the Marvel MCU movies/series in chronological order, this one really makes sense and stands out beautifully.","10/10"
"The Avengers","ketgup83","27 April 2012","Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first teaser. I was waiting for this movie from the time they announced it and my joy knew no bounds when I saw the movie tonight. In one word ‚Äì Superb. I don't mind watching it once again. S.H.I.E.L.D director, Nick Fury is threatened by Loki and his armed forces. Loki is sinister brother of Thor who was dethroned from Kingdom of Asgard for his misdeeds. He plans an attack on Earth by opening a portal through which his army can arrive into the Earth from Asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into Loki's slave. In order to protect Earth from destruction, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by Ironman , Captain America , Thor and Hulk along with Black Widow and HawkEye. Together , they must fight the evil Loki before he captures the people of earth and turns them into his slave It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. The movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers steam and makes it more entertaining. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of Hulk , the fight between Thor and Ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Robert Downey Jr. clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. His puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as Bruce Banner and his change of expression as The Hulk. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well. Excellent 4/5","10/10"
"The Avengers","tavenger-71455","16 February 2023","Gave me a lot of goosebumps when i saw it for the first time. This movie was my childhood's favourite movie with a good reason. The movie has great dialog and a great plot with great characters and an amusing villain with a great actor playing it. The movie lives up to its hype, and it created a great story for several thrilling movies to follow up. The visual effects are amazing and you can see the amount of effort the put in the movie with all of it's aspects the movie has a great end battle between Loki and his army against the avengers being one of the most iconic battle in the movie history for a super hero movie!","10/10"
"The Avengers","PlugInYourBrain","29 August 2012","The good: Robert Downey Jr. is charming as ever. Scarlett Johannsen is delicious as ever. Chris Evans makes a great Captain America. Mark Ruffalo turned in a good performance as David Banner. Samuel Jackson is usual Bad-ass self. Did I leave anyone out? The CGI is up to today's usual high standard. Oh I nearly forgot: The Thor guy was pretty cool too, though why does a Scandinavian God speak with a British Accent?The bad: There's no plot. Loki is a 1-dimensional villain. He ""wants to be king."" He wants people to submit. That's it. That's all there is.I expected more from Joss Whedon, like the incredible reboot J. J. Abrams was able to deliver Star Trek. Damn it! I don't really care much for Star Trek, but Abrams had me nearly crying at the start of that movie.Instead with Avengers we get another paint-by-numbers Superhero movie. You *can* make a Superhero movie with Heart! Look at the original Superman, or more recently Dark Knight and even Kick Ass. I want action and plenty of it, but I also want to connect with the characters on screen.The problem with Avengers is that connection isn't there and there's not a lot happening either. The production values are high, but that's no substitute for a plot. Until the CGI battle at the end, I was a kind of bored.","4/10"
"The Avengers","anaconda-40658","3 June 2015","The Avengers (2012): Dir: Joss Whedon / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson: Here at long last is a combination of comic book superheros brought to the screen to the delight of fans. Hopefully nobody will confuse the title with that crap handed John Steed Emma Peel 1998 film that everyone wanted nothing to do with. Perhaps a title change? We have a host of superheros including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. The villain is Loki of the Thor film and he has a world domination scheme that is every bit as corny as any other world domination scheme. That doesn't matter because viewers will attend to see the combination of powers become a reality. Loki is a great villain and thankfully he is targeted by all of these heroes thus giving us great action sequences. His run-in with the Hulk is especially amusing. Joss Whedon is the right director to bring this spectacular together and the special effects created are explosive. Whedon also gives each cast member a good fair share of time. We have Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark / Iron Man whose sarcasm is a scene stealer. Chris Evans is thawed and ready as Captain America. Chris Hemsworth as Thor sets to bring Loki back to his planet for justice. Mark Ruffalo is terrific filling in as the Hulk whose anger is subdued until fans are given the payoff in full blown green fury. Scarlett Johansson oozes sexiness as Black Widow, a skilled spy trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. Third act descends to action combination of the various talented ensemble that is a thrill. Score: 9 / 10","9/10"
"The Avengers","Mr-Fusion","6 May 2015","Tying all of the various Marvel movie threads together is a tall order, and ""The Avengers"" does a pretty fine job of that. Chief among the movie's strengths is that everyone who headlined their own movies gets some time in the sun, and that's . . . well, that's just impressive. And despite the dull NYC ""big finale"", there was some exciting Summer spectacle herein (mostly in the fight scenes). But my favorite parts were during the quieter moments, when all the noise and CGI were dialed down. The movie works best when it's a bunch of competing heroes thrown together in a room. When the egos and styles clash, Whedon's rhythms and sense of humor blossom.But it does its job admirably, and lends itself to serious popcorn-munching.7/10","6/10"
"The Avengers","wkallao","28 March 2015","This movie is just another one of Marvel's ploys to get money. After pushing out a mess of films forced to tie in with this once, you get a 2 hour, generic plot with characters who have generic back stories and abilities and are forced to work together and undoubtedly come together as one. It is NOT an original plot or even creative. I fail to see how long scenes of fighting, with the camera cutting back and forth is entertaining. If you actually truly LIKE this movie, please go see a doctor.I can't wait to see how the second film turns out. Marvel makes money purely being MARVEL, not because their films are outstanding and groundbreaking. They all have a generic plot and generic heroes. We need God to save us","2/10"
"The Avengers","Sharkey360","25 April 2012","I just got back from the movie theater where I saw The Avengers. Without spoiling anything, I must say it is indeed a spectacular spectacular and I hope to find time to watch it again in the near future. It's an action bonanza laced with fine performances (I love the arguments between Captain America and Iron Man cleverly delivered by Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr.), clever humor and not surprisingly Marvel universe references. Anyone who is a comic reader or a Marvel universe fan will notice lots of fine details on the characters, the plot and the images. Even with the daunting challenge of presenting The Avengers as an entertaining all-star gathering, director Joss Whedon cleverly told the story while utilizing the fine talents of the stars. The script was nicely done and the dialogue really reflect the minds of each character. Really, The Avengers is the complete package of entertainment that engaged me with lots of thrills and absolutely no boring moments. I highly recommend it.","6/10"
"The Avengers","ashfordofficial","20 December 2021","Other than it was filmed in a 1.85:1 format (I'm not a big fan of this format), Marvel's The Avengers is a splendid entry in the MCU, each major and minor details perfectly crafted with the help of a cutting edge photorealistic VFX and thus created the most remarkable and groundbreaking film that ever made.Joss Whedon's screenplay is the main focal point of this film. The humour and sentiment perfectly balanced in each dialogue.","1/10"
"The Avengers","changmoh","24 April 2012","This is one of the most awaited movies of all time - and for the legions of fans in Asia, the wait is going to be over soon. For those who have not yet booked their tickets, I suggest that they do so, preferably at the IMAX cineplex where the action in 3D can be overwhelming.I must say I was a bit skeptical that writer-director Joss Whedon (creator of TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"") can pull off this six-in-one superhero flick. Will it be like assembling six major egos in a small room - and cramming their style? With the plot of 'six against one (Loki)', wouldn't that be overkill and unfair advantage? Will the storyline/plot measure up to the CGI and effects that take up a major part of its US$220 million budget? Will this Disney effort follow in the heels of John Carter and go downhill? All these doubts are dashed after 20 minutes into the movie - when we find Earth being threatened by demi-god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D (for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) starts The Avenger Initiative. From here on, it is pure, Marvelous fanboy entertainment of the supreme order! You can bet this one is going to put Whedon among the ranks of top directors like Spielberg and Cameron.Those who have seen Captain America last year may remember the Tesseract, the all-powerful energy cube found at the bottom of the ocean. Loki, the megalomaniacal brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) manages to get his hands on it and plans to use it to summon his army of outer space warriors to take over the world.To stop him, Fury and his assistant Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) assemble the various 'superheroes' on his massive 'helicarrier' in preparation for war against Loki's forces. These include Steve Rogers' Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark's Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor. Special agent Clint Barton, or Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) makes up the sixth member a bit later when Manhattan is being bombarded by outer space monsters.The climactic battle takes up almost all of the final half-hour but the whole movie is absorbing enough, thanks to a cleverly written script that incorporates a fine balance of sincerity and self-effacing wit. Indeed, before the Avengers battle the alien invaders, they fight one another, both physically and verbally. Like, Iron Man's quips when he first meets Thor: ""What's this, Shakespeare in the park?"" and ""Does your mother know you're wearing her drapes?"" Indeed, the punchlines are more powerful - and memorable - than the real punches.Whedon does not waste time re-introducing his characters. We are already familiar with Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. The physical talents of Scar-Jo's Black Widow are 'introduced' in an interrogation scene where she later beats the brains out of her interrogators while she puts her boss Agent Coulson on hold.I have always wondered how Mark Ruffalo will fare as the Hulk - and I am surprised he almost ran away with the show. His Dr Banner is a mellow guy hiding out in India before being 'persuaded' by Natasha to join The Avengers. On board Fury's helicarrier, we can see him doing his utmost to keep his temper in check - ""you must have been doing a lot of yoga"" someone jokes. And yes, when The Hulk emerges, it is really Incredible. Also watch out for Marvel Comics' Stan Lee who gets a self-effacing one-liner during the action scenes.One of the 'misses' of this film is that Natalie Portman's Jane is left out of Thor's story - except for a picture. This is in contrast to Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) which takes up quite a few scenes. And even though he has to face-off against six superheroes, Hiddleston's Loki is formidable and menacing enough as the arch villain. Of course, Jackson finally has a proper role here after cameos in the previous Iron Man and Captain America films.It really isn't about whether you're going to catch ""The Avengers""; it's how many times you will want to see it.","10/10"
"The Avengers","XweAponX","24 August 2012","As I missed this in the Theatre, I waited a long time for the Blu-Ray to come out. I knew back in 2008 when Iron Man came out, that The Avengers were Assembling.I did not understand why Marvel made a second ""Hulk"" film after Ang lee's marvel-ous work, but that Hulk was a stand-alone story, and not worked into the fabric of the Marvel Multiverse.Each solo Avengers film introduced characters which were to be in this film, Iron Man was the most developed of them all, The Hulk, Captain America and Thor each developed those characters for this film.There was one more Avenger that should have been included, Wolverine, but at the time Marvel did not have the rights. Even so, Wolverine was not part of that first Avengers comic so long ago where they Battle Loki, and that is what this film was about.Joss Whedon was the prefect director to tackle this: His work on his Television shows and the Movie ""Serenity"" prepared him for it. I was glad that an Underdog was given the Helm, and he succeeded brilliantly.After being Bombarded by the first Three X-Men films and the Sam Raimi Spidey Trilogy, it was just time to make this film. The Avengers are that one Marvel Property that has threads into all of Marvel's Super Heroes.The pivotal piece was Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury - I grew up when Nick Fury was a white guy and he was a much different character. Sometime in the late 90's and early 2000's Marvel recreated all of their Heroes and gave some of them a complete Makeover: But Jackson plays Fury much the same way David Hasselhoff did in the TV Movie. It does not matter what colour he is, white or black, he's the same guy.It is this one man who spearheads ""The Avengers Initiative"" - Even though his board of supervisors have put the program ""on ice"" Fury finds a way to make it happen, he puts together a ""response team"" to deal with the threat of Loki.We met Loki in ""Thor"" - Originally he was Thor's ""Brother"" and best friend. In ""Thor"" Loki learns he is actually a Frost Giant (Which is actually part of the Norse Legend) and something snaps in him. The Loki in The Avengers is not the subdued, Quiet Loki we meet in the first few scenes of Thor, he has completely lost it.This Mirrors the way he was written for the Comic Books, the way I see it, Loki does not really know what he wants, so he is just trying as many bad things as he can think up. In the case of this film, he has made a shaky alliance with some creepo Aliens (We learn exactly who these guys are, at the very end of the film, after the title credits), as ""The Other"" is talking to his boss, who turns in Profile and he is a SKRULL).The Tesseract, the ""Cosmic Cube"" which has been a huge part of Marvel stories, was seen in Captain America, Red Skull was abusing it, it fell into the arctic ice and Howard Stark grabbed it. After the events of the Movie Thor, Fury assigns Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) to figure out what the futz this thing actually is.And they find out, as ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) states at the beginning of the film, The Cube is a doorway, and it is being opened from the other side.In steps Loki and he has gone even more insane, comparing the Human Race to bugs to be squashed via a Boot. Loki manages to turn Hawkeye and Selvig (This is another thing about Loki which came from the Comics), and the entire complex where The Cube was being tested caves in, huge Radar antenna and all.From this point on, it's Non Stop. We get to see SO much stuff from the Comics, the SHIELD HeliCarrier, the Avengers Mansion (Which was Stark Tower). But the best thing was the interaction of these guys, they don't get along in the Comics, and they don't get along very well at first here. What surprised me was how well Mark Ruffalo made The Hulk come to life, even though I liked Ang Lee's Hulk better: But Rufallo actually ""Acted"" The Hulk, which was something not done in the two Hulk Movies.From this point on, Avengers sets a Bar for Marvel Movies that will be difficult to reach again, let alone surpass.This film easily surpasses the quality of the first two X-Men films, without burying them.","2/10"
"The Avengers","Fields201","7 May 2012","So much build up and it all leads to this: And it's awesome! I know I'm late in reviewing this and everything has been said in all kinds of praise and this movie deserves it. Just see it. Even if you don't like comic book movies: See it. What I find amusing is that Ironman was never really the top billing of The Avengers. It was always Captain America... until now. Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene that his name is first on the credits. Seriously, he's that awesome. I was also surprised with Mark Ruffalo's performance as The Hulk. He was great! His scenes with Robert Downey Jr. are some of the most memorable. I also haven't seen the Thor flick but the guy who played them was really good and really seemed into character. Hawkeye was cool and Scarlett Johanssen is hot. Okay, the plot? Bad guy named Loki wants to take over the world and does a really good General Zod impression (Kneel before me!) and Avengers try to stop him. What's funny is that he looks tough in the beginning but then turns into a rag doll at the end. Just ask The Hulk. And whatever injustice the previous movies had done to The Hulk certainly makes up for it here.Just see it! It's a lot of fun and it's what summer movies are supposed to be. It's a great beginning to summer movies. I'm glad I went!","8/10"
"The Avengers","mrashtastic89","8 February 2022","The Avengers is a stunning film, one of the MCU's best and revolutionary for the genre, everything a gigantic Marvel fan (like myself) could ask for.It is non-stop thrills and breathtaking visual effects with incredible characterization for each character, some of the best action in any superhero movie and a true sense of passion for the craft.It's also Marvel's second funniest film after No Way Home and has the best comic book villain besides Thanos, played with perfection by Tom Hiddleston.It also has the best end credits scene in any Marvel movie, hands down, and it uses the iconic music in an incredible way, forming an experience like never before.The 2 and a half hour runtime goes by like nothing, and this is a must see for any Marvel fan.There's no grade that I could give this that isn't an A+, ranked 4th on my Marvel ranking.üôå","9/10"
"The Avengers","Eightiesjunkie","19 January 2013","I know a lot of critics and fans loved this movie, but unfortunately, this movie just didn't do anything for me. My first biggest problem with this movie: Mark Ruffalo was HORRIBLE as Bruce Banner! It was like he was sleepwalking through the entire movie! Marvel fired Edward Norton, and the best replacement they could find was this guy? Did they just pick his name out of a hat? Come on! My second biggest problem with this movie: Captain America gets pushed to the side, and most of the focus is on Iron Man. Why?! Here's a crazy idea: Seeing as how Captain America is the LEADER of the Avengers! Why not give him the spotlight? Furthermore, Iron Man and Captain America hardly ever get along in this movie. This wasn't at ALL like it was in the comics! In the comics, Tony Stark deeply admired and respected Steve Rogers. In Fact, Tony Stark's father, Howard helped create the ""Captain America"" program. My third biggest problem with this movie: It takes FOREVER for the The Avengers to come together and work as a team. Throughout the movie, all they do is fight most of the time, and occasionally throw in a corny joke. Can someone please tell me what purpose that serves, other than to look cool? If you like generic, run of the mill, superhero movies, then give this a watch. However, don't expect this movie to be deep and meaningful, because you will be sorely disappointed.","5/10"

"The Avengers","anthonypape","2 June 2013","I missed this movie when it came out at the cinema because, from what I could see from the trailers and elsewhere, it looked a bit 'silly' for want of a better word, kid's stuff perhaps. We've come to expect much more from comic book interpretations. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Iron Man series, Spiderman and Batman reboots. Where I draw the line I think, is with characters such as Thor and Captain America and to a lesser extent the Hulk - characters who haven't dated too well at all and should have been left in their respective times. They just look so out of place sitting along side the more believable and 'cooler' looking characters like Iron man in present day settings. But anyhow, having seen the high ratings the movie was getting (including on here) I thought 'maybe it cant be so bad after all?' and gave it a look. Sadly my initial instinct was right - this film is well made, has great CGI and acting, but.. its entirely spoilt by the inclusion of silly outdated characters with dubious special powers and a guy who turns into a CGI cartoon green man/monster. I realise that it wouldn't be as much of an assemble without these characters and to substitute spiderman or other superheroes might well upset some purists, but might have made for a better film. Thor in particular is from a bygone era of comic books and should have been left there.","3/10"
"The Avengers","kaden_lewis","14 June 2021","The best movie of phase 1! This movie was literally perfect. It had a great plot, a great story, great acting, and one of the best villains in the MCU. I thought the way they tied in parts or Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger through the Tesseract was cool. I also liked how the movie centered around Loki and his quest to rule Midgard (Earth), by stealing the Tesseract from a S. H. I. E. L. D base, taking command of Hawkeye, Selvig and Shield agents, and him teaming up with the Chitauri to attack New York and eventually the world. The story and dialogue was even good, I liked how the Avengers would always bicker together, and I also liked the punny jokes. I also loved the fact that the soul reason The Avengers decided to work together was due to the death of Coulson. Like always, the acting by everyone was great, even the new additions. Lastly, Tom Hiddleston as Loki was absolutely amazing. He played the role to perfection again. He is always great and I really hope to see a lot more of him in the future.Like I said, this was the best movie of Phase 1, I recommend this to anyone, even people who haven't seen any MCU movies before.","8/10"
"The Avengers","Red_Identity","11 June 2012","I had never been heavily anticipating The Avengers. I'm not a huge fan of any of these superheroes, and haven't been up to date on most of these. I only saw the first Iron Man and the two Hulk films, but honestly nothing Marvel released since then. The Avengers surprised me. It turned out to be a fairly slow-paced film with subtle character dynamics and nuanced performances. Okay, really, it's just a BLAST! Nothing more has to be said. It has a tone that giddily encourages you to get on board. It's pretty much everything you expect, but it doesn't insult your intelligence. In fact, the characters and dialogue are all pretty well-written. A film like this could have had just as amazing action sequences, but with lesser writing and development, wouldn't be nearly as satisfying. Truly, there's something to enjoy in all of these characters, particularly Banner (perfectly portrayed by Ruffalo) and the always charming Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Having not seen Thor, I enjoyed him a lot too and thought Hemsworth was pretty excellent. Technially, it's excellent. The editing is fantastic, and there is not a single flaw within the editing achievement. Editing action films, especially in their big moments, can be very hard to accomplish, but these filmmakers did an impeccable job. The action sequences are amazing, and big, huge. Overall, there's so much excitement to be had here. I don't have a problem calling The Avengers THE ""perfect summer blockbuster"". It truly is, and boy what a ride it is. Strongly recommended to everyone.","4/10"

"The Avengers","chancey-23","14 July 2012","The Avengers is truly a film that should be considered an instant classic. Joss Whedon does more than do justice to getting four superheroes on the screen, but he makes a tremendous yarn to go with it. Yes, the greatest strength of the film is the screenplay. The one liners are a keeper, and it comes with some great performances as well, particularly with Robert Downey, Jr and Mark Ruffalo. The film entertains in action, succeeds in comedy, and manages to be one of the greatest films we're bound to see this summer, and potentially one of the best films we'll see of the year. And an end note, if you do a sequel, please keep Joss Whedon. Without him, expect The Avengers 2 to be less entertaining overall.","2/10"
"The Avengers","batleh","27 May 2012","As someone who has not read Marvel comics, has not seen the films ""Captain America,"" ""The Hulk,"" ""Thor,"" or ""Iron Man II,"" this film failed to pull me in. As a standalone movie, ""The Avengers"" feels like a mishmash of rapid surface-level character introduction and way too much action. Little attention is given to character development, as it seems viewers are expected to come into the film with a degree of knowledge. However, this is not to say that I think the film would be great if I did have some knowledge of the backstory. There's little in the way of a moral here or a deeper meaning, as this is just a good-GUY-saves-world plot. It's one that (like many superhero movies before) makes me ask if character development or THOUGHT, for that matter, really are being extinguished by money-driven action. I wouldn't even call this a ""popcorn movie,"" as I found few laughs and absolutely no connection to the characters in my experience. I like action movies, but I need to be drawn in to the characters in order to CARE about the action. ""The Avengers"" didn't even try to draw me in, it just said ""here are the heroes, now watch them fight!"" If the first hour had established some human element for the heroes, I might have liked the action. As it stands, the audience is thrown into the arena with the invincible combatants, and expected to immediately feel for them despite their inherent invincibility. I must ask - why should I care about action when one side can't lose and I haven't been told otherwise? Why should I root for the Yankees? (The only reason I can see is because the ""bad guy"" Loki wears a ridiculous looking costume). I keep attempting to find redemption in society's reception of this movie. Maybe that's why I hope that I'm just missing a big part of the backstory. I'm a big Whedon fan, and came into ""The Avengers"" hoping to see some more of his magic. I was rewarded with a two-and-a-half hour snooze fest of CG action. My only sincere hope is that the millions he makes off of this movie funds ""real"" projects of his in the future.","4/10"

He seemed to have little dialogue, and screen time, as a Hawkeye fan, I was afraid he was going to get shortchanged in the film.

"The Avengers","MLDinTN","25 March 2013","I was fully expecting to not like this movie because I haven't thought much of Iron Man or Captain America movies, but the story behind this film was better than I expected. Also, you need to have seen previous superhero movies to get this movie, especially Thor. Loki, Thor's evil brother, comes to earth to lead an alien invasion and it's up to the superheros to stop him. The Black Widow and Hawkeye have very little to do and could have been left out. So basically, the heroes are chasing Loki around until the invasion when there is a huge battle at the end. The battle was cool with cool computer effects. This is when the Hulk gets to play his big part. But the main heroes in the film were Thor and Ironman, and Captain America gets to make a few decisions too.FINAL VERDICT: OK action flick, but you need to know about the previous superhero movies to get this one.","10/10"
"The Avengers","lionhrt","29 June 2013","I really enjoyed the earlier ones but this was really dumbed down.With very little effort they could have made this a great movie.You cannot defy laws of physics in special effects or it becomes completely 5 year old cartoon nonsense. That is the problem here. Be logical with the scenes instead of being lazy. The graphics capability is there so don't cheapen it by taking short cuts.It distracts from the entire movie.That, and great effects mixed in with the most primitive of video overdubbing. In many scenes you can plainly see the backdrop with people standing in front of it. You'd think you were watching a 1940s film with overdubbing ... geeesh.Come on, do it right or don't do it at all.","10/10"
"The Avengers","Floated2","10 December 2013","The Avengers was very well waited among Marvel comic book fans and general superhero fans. When it comes to delving deeply into the minds or motivations of the film's other, previously established heroes, he abstains all together. And maybe that's for the best. Even with 2 hours and 24 minutes to kill, there's precious little time for him to offer remedial courses in Marvel mythology. Those who haven't done their homework and watched the previous films still should be able to follow the basics, but they almost certainly will be left scratching their heads from time to time. In the mix among stars doing battle are Scarlett Johansson, who plays the Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as archery expert Hawkeye. There were a lot of high expectations for this film and on many levels it delivers, while on few others it disappoints. Since writer-director Joss Whedon was dealing with so many big-name stars, like Robert Downey Jr., who reprises his role as Iron Man, Gwenyth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Mark Ruffalo, who takes over the role of Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk, there's just not enough screen time to fit everyone adequately in.For those who have kept up with it, though, The Avengers is a nice payoff to a sprawling and ambitious filmmaking strategy, and one whose blueprint can be counted on to change the way major studios approach their superhero franchises for years to come.

As a rewatch 05/01/18' and nearly 5 years since initial watch 12/10/13' opinions remain near same. The Avengers has great entertainment value, though at the same time some of it feels quite bland and uninteresting. The finale battle elevates the film as a whole but much forgettable scenes I had forgotten.","10/10"
"The Avengers","morefshpls","16 May 2012","How I would love to have championed Joss Whedon for this. But alas, no.The Avengers is not a great movie. Avengers is a boring movie.OK, I saw it in 3D. The only other film I've seen in 3D was Avatar and - this may also indicate to you I'm not a movie snoot - I rather thought Avatar was OK, unlike many who say it's awful. You would be right therefore, to infer that the novelty of 3D hasn't exactly had a chance to wear thin on me yet.Let's just get the 3D out of the way: for me, it was like watching a holographic projection, very unreal. Often there were only 2, maybe just 3 planes of focus and sometimes this made the focus too oddly focused!, e.g. a wobbling briefcase in the foreground that looked like something out of Toy Story. Also, some of the action with Johanssen is frantic CGI cartoony acrobatics, and in 3D this just looks even more of a mess, anything but exciting! I was cautioned not to see in 3D - that person was right. The print isn't compensated for by the darkening effect of the glasses. I think it affected me too. Eye-fatigue, plus the combination of how those glasses make the film so dark, plus a major major flaw in the film, caused me to give up on consciousness and spare my eyeballs more than once.Yes, in 3D at least, this film is too dark to see what's going on. Detail becomes elusive and the 3D focus only allows you to see one or two parts of the screen - everything else is often deliberately way out-of-focus. This makes the film visually uninteresting (especially for us 'autistic' background viewers ;-).And the major major flaw.. Oh, I might have already let that slip: this movie is boring! Surely I can't be so bored that easily by a film I've never seen before! It's impossible! Avengers: yes, there's some showy effects that may impress those that can get off on over 2 hours of blam blam blam but me: yaaaawwn! Honestly, I was expecting to enjoy The Avengers, especially since I kinda liked the Thor movie (nothing to do with Portman, who does very little for me). And also, my total non-appreciation for The Avengers goes against what I'd hoped... that I could say something great about this film, and be able to champion Joss Whedon for a new era of Sci-Fi movies. Serenity was good, very good - albeit with forgivably TV-movie quality. Unfortunately, it seems, budget wasn't the limiting factor and I've now lost interest.Duncan Jones, do you hear?","9/10"
"The Avengers","joker-4","11 May 2012","If you have been a fan of the core Marvel Studios' films since 2008's IRON MAN, where the beginnings of the ""Avengers Initiative"" were first teased and carried through into the 2010 sequel as well as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER, then the AVENGERS will not disappoint. In fact, it very well might make you question why the other franchise films weren't as good as this fast- paced, funny, superhero showdown.Marvel has been very focused and dedicated with the development of its properties under the Disney banner ‚Äì and they no doubt wish that the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises could return to their fold, as it was the success of these earlier films that brought Marvel Comics out of bankruptcy ‚Äì and has been providing solid entertainment from its creators and stars alike; by Odin's beard, Sir Kenneth Branagh directed THOR. Enter Joss Whedon, who created a weekly TV show in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER that was a near-perfect example of a live-action comic book, to deliver a heavily-anticipated yet so-easy-to-fail production of getting such a diverse character set in a movie that worked. And worked it did.The film gets off to a slow and even somewhat murky start as Loki, Thor's mischievous half-brother, played with a Anthony Hopkins-worthy sneer by Tom Hiddleston, appears, escapes from and is responsible for the destruction of a SHIELD HQ as well as the spiriting away of a few supporting characters including Stellan Skarsgard's Dr. Selvig, also of THOR, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, getting the full movie treatment here, all under the semi-impotent glare of Samuel L. Jackson's one-eyed spy Nick Fury. Obiously Loki never saw Samuel L's wallet from another film.The movie picks up with the re-introduction of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow as Whedon has some fun showing what moves he could have presented in BUFFY if he had an Avengers-sized budget backing him up, but it truly gets bright when the three protagonists, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, finally appear and, of course, get into a wrestling match to prove who has the biggest repulsor/shield/hammer. Once the team finally assembles, insanity, and the hilarity that often follows, ensues. Oh, and Mark Ruffalo proves that the Hulk can indeed smash.Joss Whedon's adept skills, he also writes the screenplay, prove to be the other superhero powerhouse as he successfully created a production that pleases the hardcore fanboy who is aware of Thanos, the mainstream movie audience who thinks that Tony and Pepper are destined for each other, and his own loyal, core fan base of Browncoats. Each hero gets their own time to shine in situations worthy of a comicbook splash page. The rough-up dust-up of a third act that entirely deals with the assembled team involved in a street-level brawl in NYC against, what else, an invading alien army, could very well have became tedious, as admittedly, the obligatory interstellar menace is faceless, forgettable and seemingly invented for the sales of action figures, but the action, humor and allure of these powerful heroes is truly something unique and that magic is perfectly captured on the screen.2008 saw the release of both IRON MAN and Warner Bros.' DARK KNIGHT. The result was that both films set the bar that future genre films would have to follow. In 2012 that bar was set yet again. What remains to be seen is if the upcoming DARK KNIGHT RISES film, as well as the sequels for IRON MAN, THOR and CAPTAIN America, will continue to raise that bar, or if they will all just... assemble.","10/10"
"The Avengers","rchalloner","18 February 2013","I find it hard to believe that a film which was mostly made on a computer has such a high average rating. Does anyone care anymore that so little effort and imagination goes into film making? Avengers is 95% CGI, with a plot that is staggering in it's stupidity and unoriginality. Two of the so-called 'super-heroes' have no 'super' qualities at all - unless having funny coloured eyes and firing souped-up arrows or running around in a tight spandex suit showing lots of cleavage and pouting a lot qualify as super powers. All Black Widow does is what Emma Peel did 45 years ago - and half as well, i.e. kick ass. Even worse, the two best and most interesting Marvel characters, Iron Man and Hulk are reduced to mindless morons smashing their way through the enemy and without any attempt at the characterization that previous films did at least endeavour to give them. Every scene and plot twist is utterly predictable, the special effects are boring and the only thing to admire is Samuel L. Jackson'e uncanny ability to find high grossing movie trash to take a stroll through, without making the least effort, and pick up a fat cheque at the other end. Now THAT IS a super power.","6/10"
"The Avengers","anselmdaniel","27 January 2023","This review contains spoilers.The Avengers is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2012. The movie is directed by Joss Whedon, produced by Kevin Feige, screenplay by Joss Whedon. The story is written by Zak Penn, and Joss Whedon. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Hiddleston. Loki launches an invasion of Earth leading the heroes of the Earth to band together and stop the invasion.The Avengers is a great action movie. The movie incorporates the grand visuals found in the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and combines them for one spectacle featuring the heroes that we know and love. The movie focuses on the spectacle rather than having a complex narrative focusing on specific characters. In this way it is more of a large set piece with pre-existing characters rather than a full narrative movie. The spectacle is impressive to watch with the ending battle in New York City being the highlight. The scenes leading up to that moment are impressive as the heroes band and fight amongst each other. The movie is about the heroes as a whole rather than individuals.The Avengers has great chemistry with its leads. Not only does the audience see visually impressive action but also the dynamic between the superheroes. The movie relishes in the heroes it has on display and it is a treat to watch for comic book fans. Audiences can see the heroes have their quarrel and what happens when Thor's hammer hits Captain America's shield. The story concerns the heroes and it is believable that Nick Fury's Avengers squad would not get along at first. It makes for an interesting story as the squad eventually overcomes their differences and begins to work together. This is a classic trope that is applied to a superhero story.The flaw of this movie is that Loki has not been built up as a massive villain before. Loki always seemed more like a joker and a specific villain for Thor rather than a large scale villain that spanned into Iron Man and Captain America's stories. I still enjoyed Tom Hiddleston's performance and watching him on the screen is sure to delight.I would recommend ""The Avengers"" directed by Joss Whedon.Grade: B.","4/10"
"The Avengers","educallejero","10 April 2019","Even if the movie, the story, wasn't that great, this movie changed cinema (for better or worse), creating a path to serialized ""event"" movies, all ""important"" to have the whole picture of the insane 23 movies arc of the Avengers. Without this movie being this fun, well paced and put together, we wouldn't have the MCU.And it pretty much delivered on what it promised. Without the need to introduce the main characters, the movie ditched the typical structure and started with a bang to never slow down, really. With action from the start, connecting every single character already presented (the six heroes, their recruiter, the villain). The movie assumed we all knew the characters because we saw the other movies (making them literally a ""must watch"" to savior all the details and enhance the experience), which was the best decision ever. They didn't follow the rules (they created their own, which will be become stalled later) and made the best possible ensemble movie.But it wasn't just pure action, because with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, they started (and would continue in the next movies) their philosophical (lightly philosophical, but still) exploration of war against an exterior threat. And they still managed to give the others moments to shine (if not really arcs of their own). Thor and Hulk with their powers; Black Widow's smart spy mind; Fury's uniting the team, etc.The action is insane and the CGI ridiculously perfect. Loki is perfect for a first villain and the dialogue is funny with the needed exposition done well.Having said all that, the second act could be better and parts a bit too childish or just stupid (Loki vs. Hulk; Hulk ""I'm always angry""; Hulk vs. Thor). But ultra minor things. Amazing movie.","10/10"
"The Avengers","briancham1994","5 August 2020","This was a very widely anticipated film and it had a big impact as well. Yet it did not leave much of an impression on me. The only thing I'll give it credit for is balancing all of the cast quite well. It features a lot of main characters and juggles their screentime quite effectively. However, the story itself is quite forgettable and devolves into a generic CGI battle against a generic alien army with a generic sky beam posing as the ultimate threat.","10/10"
"The Avengers","lilantman10","10 December 2012","Finally the Marvel Franchise reveals it's coup de grace and it's everything that we hoped for. Before I totally kiss this movie's butt for a while I'm going to delve into the negatives first.Just a warning the first 25 minutes are a little slow, which is to be expected when telling such a large story. Lord of the Rings needed a whole movie to build up to the adventure to put it into context. Some of Loki's dialogue is a little hard to understand at times because of the Norse language dialect, but that's easily fixed with second viewings. Other than that and some nitpicks the movie delivers.This is the movie we all made playing with our toys as a kid. Wheedon has done a fantastic job and I really don't think this movie could've worked as well without him. All the characters fit in this movie. I never thought a conversation between Loki and Nick Fury would work on screen but it does. Every character gets to shine in this movie. At time it's a Black Widow movie, then an Ironman movie, then a Thor movie, then a Captain America movie it all just fits perfectly. This movie has the best editing I've seen all year and some of the best acting to go with it. This movie is a culmination of several geek movies in one. It's got the ear turning and self reflection of Scott Pilgrim with the ensemble aspect of Star Trek (2009) with great dialogue. I'm going to say character a lot because that's the focus. The story is a little weak because it comes second to the characters. I've always described superhero movies are character pieces with big budgets. A lot of people complained that it's a comedy or that it's just a loud mindless movie with explosions like Transformers. Since when does having great humor make something a comedy? All the humor is in the witty dialogue and a few physical gags which are hilarious and also unique to the characters. And Wheedon adds lots of little subtle setups to the ending to make the movie more cohesive and smarter than it is. It's not a bad story it's just a simple character driven one. The only superhero movie I know that has more emphasis on story is The Dark Knight, but this blows that out of the water. 6 heroes are better than one. That's why Lord of The Rings, Star Trek, and Toy Story are so great. The Team or The Ensemble. There are so many ways this movie could've been ruined. Maybe they got the writing right, and the action is choreographed well but is filmed with shaky cam or is incoherent. All the action scenes in this movie are great and easy on the eyes and even have lots of character in them. The best scene in this movie is when the avengers are all arguing in a room. And the acting is the greatest. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. This movie is so much fun and if you don't like it it's probably because you didn't want to so anybody with an open mind should love this 10 out of 10","10/10"
"The Avengers","puzgolac","10 May 2012","Deceived by the praise and high ratings this movie received here I decided to watch it, even though I didn't like Thor, couldn't sit through the propaganda that was Captain America, and thought that both of the Ironmen were only average. The movie is just fighting, explosions, destruction to infinity, and the action isn't anything that you haven't seen before. There is just more of it, which doesn't make it better - it just makes it become boring and repetitive really fast. Scattered amongst those are retarded dialogs and stupid one-liners, seasoned with terrible acting and corny motivational speeches in the vein of ""God bless America, and make the rest of the world (or rather Universe) its colony."" Samuel L. Jackson was unbelievably terrible, Scarlett Johansson was terrible, and was that Sherlock Holmes wearing a suit of armor? I could have sworn that the character was the same, only the name was different. So much for Robert Downey's versatility. The rest of the cast followed suit. The only decent actor in this movie was Tom Hiddleston , but his character was ruined by the writers. Loki is supposed to be a god, but here he is so mediocre, that it is ridiculous. His ""mighty"" spear is nothing more than a very low grade laser gun, which doubles as a mind control tool that doesn't work all of the time, and when it does work, it does not work all that well. The mighty, fearsome aliens turn out to be mere cannon fodder, dropping like mosquitoes. Characters' level of strength and power changes throughout the movie to suit the need of the moment. There are 2 (yes, TWO) funny scenes, and both include the Hulk beating up people. That should give you an idea about the quality of the funny parts of the movie. I guess to like this one you would either have to be a die hard fan of the Avengers, or a die hard fan of mindless, repetitive, boring action. This movie doesn't require suspension of belief to be enjoyed. It requires suspension of brain functions.","9/10"
"The Avengers","jace_the_film_guy","16 July 2021","The Avengers film was meticulously crafted and well thought out. There was careful consideration taken in every element, every plotline and every piece of dialogue, which is can be positive but also negative. Because it was such a monumental cinematic moment, it seemed as though the filmmakers were doing everything possible to not mess it up and therefore did not take many risks. That being said, the film itself is fantastic. Seeing Earth's mightiest heroes fight side by side give you goosebumps, there are genuinely funny moments and the plot moves forward logically. However, compared to later films in the MCU, The Avengers just seems a little too safe.","9/10"
"The Avengers","asc85","26 May 2012","...this film wasn't good at all. With the exception of the excitement of seeing all these leading characters in one movie, I fail to see why everyone has been running and running to this movie. First of all, the acting is terrible, led by Chris Evans as a far-too-earnest Captain America, and Chris Hemsworth as a heavily accented Thor with dialogue that made sense hundreds of years ago, but not in 2012. Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, and Scarlett Johansson are decent enough, but no Academy Award nominees there. The plot and many of the sub-plots were difficult to follow, as the primary purpose of this movie was to show cars, buildings, and people being blown up. I understand that I'm not in this movie's target demographic, but the X-Men series and Iron Man were far more intelligent and interesting than this. Yes, I know this will be one of the highest grossing pictures of all-time, which is why I wanted to know what all the fuss was. Yes, I know there will be many sequels generated from this, which makes sense. Just count me out from going to see them.","8/10"

"The Avengers","laurenthoutent","3 June 2012","I walked in the cinema when there was about 1/2 hour left of the movie. I thought I had entered the wrong hall in the complex and had walked into the Transformers 3 performance.Same snake type cgi, same scenes of cars flying around, same type of buildings being wrecked and in the same manner.The only apparent difference was the main characters which made me realise I was not watching Transformers 3 but something strangely similar. I had seen enough and did not stay in the hall to watch the film from the start.I can't understand why this film got a 8.6 note. Perhaps everyone who participated logged in and gave it 10? I gave it 2 instead of 1 only because Jenny Agutter is in it.","9/10"
"The Avengers","walentys","29 August 2018","The only way this film can be enjoyed is to toss away all expectations of what makes up good cinema and instead go in expecting some cool action, hot chicks and a few wisecracks.In this endeavor it succeeds fairly well; it is in fact almost nonstop action, and it flows well for this purpose. There's hardly a moment of relative boredom or dullness, and it keeps your attention throughout. Pacing is something many films have trouble with and this does it well.The special effects and sound editing were very well-done too. Not once did I think they were overdone or cheesy-looking/-sounding, and they packed a punch. The way the aliens looked was neat, and most of the fighting was cool to watch. What sticks out in my memory is Thor hitting his hammer against Captain America's shield, an awesomely done scene for effects.The humorous one-liners, mostly stemming from Tony Stark but also from the camaraderie among the Avengers group, also work well enough and keep you at least smiling throughout.However, I sensed a strong amount of cold, calculated filmmaking here. I felt almost no style in this entire film, and instead I felt as if Joss Whedon had a quota to fill as he was filming it. It's almost as if he was thinking, ""I need to show what happens during the following encounters: Thor vs. Captain America, Thor vs. Iron Man, Iron Man vs. Loki"", etc., and then later on, many combinations of two or three of the Avengers fighting bad guys together, to contrast their earlier conflicts. I appreciate the contrast that went into that aspect, but it just felt plain robotic the way it was executed. The thought pattern I detected was, ""You damn well can't have an Avengers movie without this happening, and this, and..."" The result of this is that this ""quota"" took the focus and actually enticing filmmaking was put on the backburner. He was simply showing things happening with entirely no flair or style of direction whatsoever. Oh look, here's Iron Man coming in to save the day! He's going to say something funny, don't we know it! Nothing stylish, unexpected or cinematic happens in this entire film. It left a dry taste in my mouth, despite all the cool effects and fighting.The story, along with the direction, was very milquetoast and forgettable. To briefly summarize: Loki, an alien, comes down to Earth to wreak havoc; the Avengers team up and stop him and all the aliens he summons through a giant portal as well. You'd think Nick Fury, being the leader of the Avengers, would take on a more interesting storyline role, but he really doesn't. I was maniacally uninterested in every single scene with him talking to the heads of S.H.I.E.L.D., and beyond that his storyline doesn't really go many places in this film. In fact all the other individual character storylines didn't really go anywhere either, which is okay since this film was a group effort, but the overall group storyline was not very interesting either, basically another rendition of saving the planet. Therefore neither the overarching group storyline nor the individual storylines were very fulfilling, leaving the story as a whole lacking.The script was also extremely dry and poorly written. I feel this was another item that went on the backburner to give the aforementioned ""quota"" more focus. Most of the lines were very uninteresting and without character. One example that stuck out in my mind is Nick Fury saying, ""I'll bet you $10 you're wrong"". People may say this phrase in reality; it's not the realism about it I attack but the character and flair of it. This is a movie; when characters speak they should be saying things that are somewhat relevant, interesting, mysterious, gripping, funny, or any combination thereof. Something that delivers, something with edge or character. Most of the lines in the entire film I have completely forgotten already except ones like the above that I remembered just to point out how uninteresting they are. Just like with the direction, I felt as if the script, too, just had people saying things to move the story along. Very sparsely was any extra style or flair or character added in.Last but entirely not least is the acting, and overall I was disappointed. I'll start with the good: Robert Downey Jr. was his usual funny smartass self, and I have no complaints, nor was he exceptional. I also actually quite enjoyed Chris Evans as Captain America; I find him a talented actor who works well in various kinds of films. Also Scarlett Johansson did a great job as usual. I love Stellan Skarsg√•rd; he's a great actor, but I have to admit his placement in the film felt awkward and every time he came on screen I chose to express it through hysterical laughter. Samuel L. Jackson did a decent job as Nick Fury but I wasn't very impressed, but I blame that on the script. Now for the bad: The main villain of the film, Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, was a terrible choice for the main villain of any film. I mostly laughed at his scenes, because of how bad his acting was, when laughter was unintended. The guy who plays Thor, Chris Hemsworth, was not very good either in this film. Also Mark Ruffalo was a disappointment to see. I don't mind his acting normally but it was just so noticeably inferior to Edward Norton's Hulk that it has to count as a negative.To sum up, good pacing, special effects and some interesting encounters between certain characters do not save a film when it has weak direction, a weak script, a weak storyline, mostly weak acting, and most glaring of all it seemed very cold, calculated, and without style. However, I was at least mildly entertained.","10/10"
"The Avengers","musback","27 August 2012","Where to start. Me and my wife watched this movie yesterday, to forget about the drama called 'battleship' (don't get me started.) But it's hard to choose the most retarded movie between the two. This one had some okay jokes in it, but like many people said: you don't feel any threat, you don't feel any story, you just see special effects and ""UHMERICA F* YAA"" 2hrs straight. The effects were good, and the Hulk smashed like he never smashed before, but every movie starts sucking as soon as you realize nobody of the good guys can actually die. (Lord Of the rings anyone?) and when legions of 10x more bad-ass alien monsters are killed throwing a chair at them or blind-aimed headshotting them with a bow on a spaceship going 300mph, you know you're just wasting your time. Anybody with the very least amount of self-respect, stay away from this movie, How this garbage achieved to get 8.6 on IMDb is more entertaining for me than watching that movie. Says a lot about IMDb and what it has become compared to what it used to be.","10/10"

The acting, writing, action and effects are awesome. The jokes always hit, the cast have great chemistry and the action's just cool to watch. The fight scenes are well choreographed and really get your blood flowing. I won't give away the final fight scene but it's epic.That's the best way I can describe this movie: epic.

"The Avengers","alindsayal","12 December 2021","On my way to reviewing all the MCU films I have now made it to the end of the first phase which means I have made it to The Avengers and I re-watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of superheroes have to come together to save the world from an alien force.Main Character
He was the first star of the MCU and he is one of the main focuses here, I'm talking about Robert Downey Jnr as Tony Stark AKA Iron Man and I think he is great in the film. He has so much charisma and the one liners are coming at a really high rate in the film, the key thing for me though is that his character develops and I think what this film does really well is show you how much has changed in him since the first Iron Man film. Chris Evans is back as Captain America and it is fun seeing this man who is from another time having to deal with modern times, I also like how his character interacted with the others, also in the action scenes Cap still shines and this film doesn't even montage past all of it. The dynamic between Downey Jnr & Evans is great here and shows just how different their personalities are and how difficult it is for them to work together despite the world literally being on the line.Supporting Characters
Okay, there are so many characters so in order for this review to not be longer then it needs I will try and keep this as short as possible. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, he adds more humour and presence in the role and like all the other characters he really gets to excel by bouncing his presence off of the other characters. Tom Hiddleston plays the villain Loki and what a shock he is great too, we saw the start of the character in Thor but he has clearly progressed since then and I liked how the relationship between the two brothers develops from the previous film. Scarlett Johansson is back as Black Widow and she is much better here then she was in Iron Man 2, she is actually given a character and real time to shine and the best thing I can say is that she stands alongside these gods and super powered beings and doesn't look out of place. Jeremy Renner plays Hawkeye and they don't give him that much to do, or more like they handle the character poorly, but by the end of the film I came around to Renner in the role and given more to do he is a great fit for the character. Over the first phase of the MCU we have seen flickers of Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury but this is the most we get of him so far and he is great, he is just so cool and interesting with his motivations not being as black and white as you would expect for this film. Now onto The Hulk, Mark Ruffalo takes over the role in this film and he is great as Banner, yes it is different to Edward Norton but he feels like a natural fit and I really liked his character here. But The Hulk is the star of this film, when he gets going he is amazing and looks incredible, The Hulk has never been better then he is in this film I believe and credit has to go to him for that. Clark Gregg, Colbie Smulders & Stellan Skaarsgard are also all good in their roles.Story
As you can see by the lengthy cast list there is plenty going on here but it all balances nicely. I love the fact that the film shows that despite these characters all being heroes they don't all necessarily get along and have different views on things and it adds some much needed drama. I think the fact that we have seen their solo films aids in that as the film doesn't have to waste time with backstories and that allows the film to move at a really fast pace. Yes, there are some conveniences but I don't care, this film is so fun and the final act is comic book film greatness and delivers truly memorable moments.Script
The script is great, it just has that very snappy dialogue with plenty of one liners and dialogue that just fits the characters appropriately. There is also some depth and drama to this popcorn blockbuster film and that is good and credit to the people behind the script as this aids in making these god like characters interesting and a bit relatable.Style
The style of the film is one of the best things about the film. As I mentioned above, the pacing of the film is incredibly quick and that aids in making this an incredibly fun film. The action scenes are huge in scale and the CGI is at its best here then any MCU film that came before. Which brings me onto The Hulk, he looks amazing, the action scenes involving him are the the most exciting part of the film and finally the MCU had a Hulk that delivered in looking and fighting like he deserved.Overall
Overall, The Avengers is a special film that is a must watch for not just Marvel fans but all film fans. I think because of what The MCU now is we sometimes forget about this film and take it for granted. But without, The Avengers there wouldn't be an MCU and it is an amazing film that is honestly one of my favourite movies possibly ever.Rating - 10/10.","8/10"
"The Avengers","DareDevilKid","6 May 2012","Movie Review: The Avengers (2012) by DareDevilKid.DDKMy Rating: 8.5/10Yes! Oh, boy did this movie deliver! Its like all the cogs fitted perfectly in a well oiled mechanism. Director Joss Whedon has made a brilliant transition from the small to the big screen. The Director has delivered a classic Action/Adventure film of epic proportions. And this was no little achievement, considering all the legendary characters of folklore mostly possessing their individual blockbusters - some really good and some plain mediocre -, which were amalgamated into one huge vista.All the superheroes & even the super-villain merge into the plot beautifully and appear exactly at the opportune moments. Even a somewhat throwaway hero like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) feels vital. Her fight scenes are Buffy cool. Hemsworth and Evans are more relaxed, more comfortable in their spandex skin. If there's an underused super it's Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) but in the last act he impresses, too.But The true standout is The Hulk. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner pulls off the trick of allowing his inner rage to simmer just below the surface the whole time. And when the green dude shows up, stand back and just enjoy. He's the first version of Hulk to make his burst of power feel so gratifying. His destructive nature is infectious. Also an honorable mentions have to bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man & Chris Hemsworth's - he's really growing with each passing film - Thor, who adequately support Mark Ruffalo and his alter-ego throughout the movie.The Avengers looks great. The reportedly $250 million budget is on the screen. Many scenes have a great deal of variety. Not just well- choreographed action, there's a cleverness to the very idea to many of the scenes. Whedon pushes his heroes to their limits. When your script can put demigod Thor in peril that's incredible.The plot is simple yet effective - Thor's evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston - a slimy megalomaniac) has taken a cube called the Tesseract that harnesses limitless energy and aliens from another dimension intend to invade Earth to get it. Its easy to follow and merges well into the narration to let the film deliver what audiences really want to see - these ultimate superheroes becoming a team and kicking much butt.The action is magnanimous, the CGI effects are dazzling but ushered only when required, great and witty one-liners are interspersed intermittently, the humor is enthralling, the set-pieces are brilliant, each character is painstakingly developed, the narration is crisp and finally but most importantly, the action makes sense - a rarity for action adventure movies nowadays - in a way that you follow each minutest detail even while its bursting on screen at the rate of knots. The action occurs only after enough plot and character detailing and even when it occurs, it smoothly takes the plot forward. This rare feat elevates Whedon as the real superhero of this film.'The Avengers' reminds us of the reason we love movies ant buy tickets for admittance in a cinema hall. It will keep drawing you back for more, as viewing it just once is insulting and will leave you just plain unsatisfied. The euphoria you experience after completing this exalting visual odyssey will settle only after many long hours and then the realization will ultimately dawn - that you have been privileged to witness an classic that will be indelibly etched in cinematic archives.","10/10"
"The Avengers","bretttaylor-04022","17 January 2022","I have struggled with the four previous MCU films, I just did not find any of the characters relatable. I feel that this movie rewards you for watching the previous ones. Everything I hate about the characters the other characters are aware of and I then can relate to them this way, I don't believe this was the intention but it works for me. Also you can enjoy this film if you haven't seen the earlier MCU films because it doesn't go too deep into the characters, you just need to know the basics to enjoy it but it gives you a bit more understanding if you haven't. I think the balance between humour and tension is excellent. It is very funny when it needs to be. This could have so easily have been a disaster but I feel it is the simple story and excellent cast and the right dose of humour that makes it great. I also think if they had started with this the franchise would not have been as successful, it is the slow at times agonising build up to this that sets it apart from other franchises. It also makes sure it leaves enough for future films.","7/10"
"The Avengers","big_ryan15","25 April 2012","I've waited with baited breathe to see this movie for 4 years, ever since Sam Jackson turned up at the end of Iron Man in 2008 and uttered those words that made Marvel fans around the world weep happy tears: ""I'm here to talk about the Avengers initiative"". After 5 films I can happily report that my incredibly high expectations were not even close to high enough.The movie starts off with an introduction to each of our heroes and their antagonist: Loki. It's all pretty usual stuff from here. But once the heroes come together, the movie becomes something more. There are a lot of big egos flying around and each one is more used to being the centre of attention, especially Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. It's in these heated rows and witty banter that The Avengers becomes something that I really wasn't expecting: a family comedy. All these characters are so different and come from such different backgrounds that there is a lot of fun to be had by bouncing them off each other. The fish out of water gags at Captain America's and Thor's expense are great (""Easy there Point Break"") with Tony getting to roll off line after line of witty insults. And in the film's climax, Hulk gets most of the laughs as he smashes everything around him. The Hulk could easily have been the film's main weakness, Marvel had already tried bringing him to the screen twice with little success (Ang Lee's 2003 version being one of the most underrated superhero movies ever) but he ends up being one of the film's biggest strengths. Mark Ruffalo makes a great Bruce Banner as he actually gets to play both Banner and the Hulk through motion/performance capture (the first time ever that an actor has played both Banner and his massive alter-ego) and it works SUPER well. There was a huge cheer and applause when Chris Evans delivered the line: ""Hulk, SMASH!"" and Hulk proceeded to do so with much gusto.A few of the new characters and ones that were limited to cameos in previous films get their chance to shine here. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow gets to do more kicking (looking good doing it) and is given a love interest in Jeremy Renner's unbelievably bad-ass Hawkeye. Samuel L Jackson finally gets to spend more than 5 minutes on screen after showing up in 4 Marvel movies prior to this one as a part of his massive 9 picture deal with Marvel. Cobie Smulders (one can not measure her sex appeal) of How I Met Your Mother fame gets to show off her action chops as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill and the Stan Lee cameo is present of course.Which brings us to the film's action sequences. They are astounding.Like Transformers 3 astounding. Each one better than the last. An early 3 player bout involving Iron Man and Captain America try to take down Thor is great, but an aerial fight between Thor and the Hulk is better. But then there's the climactic ""glorious war!"" which really shows the potential of bringing this group together as they get to fight as a team. The problem with them on their own as demonstrated in previous movies, is that the film makers are limited to the adversaries to give their hero. Iron Man has just been fighting other men in suits, Thor monsters, etc. But now you can throw any enemies you want at The Avengers.The plot is relatively tight and clever, but the screenplay is the real hero; brilliantly written with some cracking dialog. Joss Whedon's directorial style translates perfectly into the blockbuster mold. The perfectly cast actors are all 100% comfortable in their roles and have great fun both bouncing off each other and uniting to fight as a team. The action sequences are breathtaking and the whole movie is terrific fun without being dumb or ""kiddy"" (Richie). In terms of where it stands in the pantheon of great comic book movies is strictly down to personal preference. But in my opinion this is the second best comic book movie ever (The Dark Knight wins out due to it's better story and villain) but is still one of the best action movies ever made.My one BIG problem with the film was the untimely murder of Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) at the hands of a rampaging Loki. I felt like this was merely a tool to evoke an emotional response (adding to his character arc) from Tony Stark, whom throughout the film mentions numerous times he wasn't even aware that Agent Coulson had a first name, but all of a sudden feels as though he had some kind of relationship with this character? I have LOVED every scene Agent Coulson has ever been involved in and I feel it was a large mistake to kill off one of the only genuinely relatable and funny human characters in the entire Marvel Universe. Perhaps in further films he will make a reappearance to collect his vintage Captain America collectible cards. One can only hope.Make sure you stay after the credits also, for those of you not in the know... be ready to google ""Thanos"" and the ""Infinity Gauntlet"" when you get home.All in all it was GREAT fun & I honestly can not wait for Whedon's Directors's Cut. A fun fact i read this afternoon involves Kevin Feige (Producer of every MARVEL film) already having plans to incorporate Spiderman and the X-men into future Avengers films, once they regain the film rights to these characters.REALLY looking forward to more Avengers. Fingers crossed Joss Whedon keeps his diary empty for many, many years to come.9/10 Well and truly Assembled.","2/10"
"The Avengers","mm-39","16 May 2012","The Avengers is okay. The movie has some weak points and strong points. The strong points out weight the weak points. The Avengers weak points are the script and special effects. The Avengers follow a predictable formula. The comic book hero scripts are redundantly formulated where a problem is created and then there is a final action showdown between good and evil. The viewers then experience the same seen it and done it before special effects. What make ""The Avengers"" stand out from other comic book movies is the character development. The Stark, and Hulk characters save ""The avengers""! Stark and Hulk create comic relief and interesting dialogue. When the Stark and Hulk disagree with the other super heroes their wit is hilarious. I give Avenger six out of ten.","9/10"
"The Avengers","leplatypus","12 January 2014","Sure, the special effects are amazing: if you remember the ""FF"" movies that are just a decade old, they appear now totally outmoded. If you compare with the ""Transformers"" that are more recent, sure, the movie is better visualized: it isn't a change of shoot each second, it's more focused about the characters and less on pure crazy action thus you can follow what happens. Sure, the casting is experimented and it was cool to see that Johnny Storm has become Steve Rogers as the actor was really cool in the aforementioned ""FF"" movies. Sure, it has some good lines (about Legolas), a real understanding of those icons (example: Hulk trying to move Thor's hammer), original new mysteries (who are the shadow people?). Sure, it adapts one of the best comics stories (the super hero who turns bad and destroys a Shielb base was Millar's ""enemy of the state""). And all this for only ""4"" ?Yes, because the first hour is totally boring: i have even slept in this black night. Also, because the screenwriter of super heroes lacks the talent of the comics writer. Stan the man who invented the Avengers could tell the same story in 22 pages: it was fast, easy to understand: Here, the plot is unintelligible, uses and abuses of scientific concepts and stupid name (tesserac?). Also, because i have the feeling to have missed a movie (what about the story about Black Widow and Hawkeye?). Also because the alien invasion is just destroy for destroy so the last hour is an astounding but hollow action scene. In conclusion, it's finally better than ""Daredevil"" but faraway of the classic Raimi's Spiderman!","10/10"
"The Avengers","KidDrehmann","5 May 2012","There are absolutely no words to describe the full percentage of enjoyment I received from this movie. The Avengers is phenomenal. Joss Whedon beautifully and artfully collaborates all of the greatness and magnitude of all the films leading to this one and directs an near exact adaptation of what Marvel always hoped the Avengers would look like on the big screen. To call this film an utter triumph would be a gross under-exaggeration. Containing some of the best action sequences ever captured on film, the wittiest and most hilarious humor I have seen, and probably the greatest chemistry between both characters and actors in cinema. Comic book fans and creators will leave theaters in an ecstasy of awe and amazement. May 4, 2012 should be marked down in the history books as the day comic book films successfully reached true perfection.","9/10"
"The Avengers","Aaron1375","14 May 2012","This movie has been a long time coming as it had its beginning in the 2008 film ""Iron Man"". There would also be ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Iron Man 2"", ""Thor"" and finally ""Captain America"". All these parts, left some wondering could they have this many superheroes in a film and it not turn out a jumbled mess? I never wondered that as all one had to do was look at the X-Men films and see that for the most part those films got it right, the main difference here was that different companies were involved so there may be some trouble. However, what we got was a film that brought a team of superheroes together and totally cranked up the action to the max. Yes, I have to say the action in this film is better than any action in other comic book films. It is not even close, they gave me here what I have been wanting! Do not get me wrong, the Batman movies are still great, I also enjoyed the Spider-man and X-men films, but this one just said this is a comic book film, and people want to see an epic battle, maybe even more than one! So no good, but relatively short fights like those found in most comic book films, we get lots of action and an epic finale! My favorite character on the Avengers is the Hulk, which explains why I did enjoy this film a good deal. He was finally done right, granted ""The Incredible Hulk"" was good too, but this was the best representation of the Hulk easily. He was presented as the strongest by far, though I nearly gasped when he and Thor faced off as I never saw that in the trailers so that was a nice treat for me and he did to Thor just what I wanted him to, punch him through something! Granted, Thor got some good hits in too, but I loved how they made it clear Hulk is the strongest one! Mark Ruffalo was also an improvement over Eric Bana and Edward Norton. He played Banner in a bit more nervous and skittish manner, unlike say Norton's who looked capable of putting up a fight without even becoming the Hulk. Hulk also got the biggest laugh in the theater I was in.So this film was everything I was hoping for and more. The rest of the cast was good too as Loki has come to Earth to capture the power of the cosmic cube (though he has someone behind him calling the shots). He plans of bringing an alien force to Earth so that he may become its king, he does this for no other reason than to irritate his brother, Thor it seems. He is still the same Loki from Thor, as you still do not know what he has going on in his mind! I was afraid he would not have this aspect in this film, but they were able to keep it. His alien force is great, and this makes for the great finale!The finale has the Avengers assembling and working together to stop the invasion and it is a grand spectacle to behold! So loved seeing the heroes utilize their skills and powers and every hero gets in some good hits. Black Widow and Hawkeye are expanded on in this film and they are pretty cool. If I were to have a complaint, it would be that there was one hero they under utilized a bit. In a film with so many heroes I guess it is to be expected, I was just surprised it was Captain America. He just did not play as big a role in the final fight as I would of liked. Sure he gave some orders, but his contribution to ending the assault was giving the Black Widow a boost. However, he was used well in the other scenes he was in, this is not a major gripe mind you...just if I can find something to complain about it is this. So in conclusion, I was impressed and loved this film. It was great to see this band of heroes slowly unite as it was watching Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury pulling the strings to get them to work together. Surprised he was listed last in the credit sequence at the end, because he played the most significant role in the film and was in it from the beginning to the end. The way it is performing at the box office also makes me think there is going to be a sequel for sure and that makes me ecstatic as they show who was calling all the shots and suffice to say I was not entirely sure who he was until he smiled and then I am like ""oh my god, yes!"" See this DC and Warner Bros, if multiple companies can come together and make an epic superhero team film then you can make a Justice League movie!","10/10"
"The Avengers","hoernkeem","7 May 2021","The Avengers (2012, Joss Whedon) (A)
I do have to hand it to Marvel and Kevin Feige. They pulled it off. So often something of this magnitude sounds amazing on paper or in theory, but rarely does it have the follow through especially when it comes to movies. This movie, however, is a home run in just about every sense of the word. After five films devoted primarily to the four main Avengers it is finally time for them to assemble and battle a threat worthy of this super team. Every primary actor returns with the notable exception of Edward Norton who is replaced by Mark Ruffalo who we would come to know as the MCU's face of the Hulk going forward. This super team will remain more or less together in this primary incarnation blowing our super hero film loving minds through 'Endgame' in 2019. Joss Whedon does a stellar job as a geek fanboy extraordinaire in the director's chair. This film combines a wonderful script with depth and plenty of the on the nose humor that these MCU films have excelled at. We get a villain in Loki and his alien invasion army worthy of the team and the stakes. None of the characters are short changed. They all get their moments to shine. The action scenes are wonderful especially the big finale battle that in itself must be practically thirty minutes of continuous action.The action stems from bad guy Loki, Thor's half brother, who, under the auspice of a mysterious benefactor, comes to Earth with a scepter of unknown power. His motives are mysterious, but ultimately it is revealed he is opening a way, utilizing the Tesseract from the Captain America film, for an alien army to invade Earth from space. He is initially demure in a deceitful attempt to divide our collective heroes, but really only serves to bring them together stronger against the adverse odds. Loki's spear also has a mind control power and he brings both Hawkeye and Selvig under his power further complicating the situation. There are some opening sequences once Loki is revealed bringing our heroes together finally, and despite some initial communication issues, and getting to know you stuff, they eventually reveal themselves to have great chemistry and camaraderie. The initial scene where Cap is fighting Loki and Iron Man swoops in is excellent as well as the subsequent scene where Thor, Captain and Iron Man initially fight over who should have custody of Loki before reaching an understanding. Hulk's appearances in the film are done excellently, but the moment of the film probably belongs to Tony in a singular self sacrifice when he flies a nuke through hole in space from which the invading army is entering from. He, in one stroke, destroys what remains of the army in space as well as diverting the nuke that was sent to destroy the aliens, and the island of Manhattan as collateral damage. The army is destroyed and the Avengers are assembled and Earth's mightiest heroes are here to keep us entertained for years to come.Until 'Endgame' came along this was the standard by which every other MCU film was measured. There may be slight issues here and there, but they are so slight as to nary merit a discussion. Everything here is operating at the highest level from script and direction to special effects to the actors essentially inhabiting these roles. At the end we even get the famous Marvel post credit scene which is the first appearance of the uber villain Thanos who would come to dominate the MCU narrative in the years to come. My love for this movie and all it accomplishes and represents cannot be overstated. We struggled through a lot of dark years with regards to super hero films. There were horrible writing jobs and horrible effects but we ate them up because at least they were something. Tim Burton started making it better but really the golden age commenced in 2008 with 'Iron Man' and Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'. No longer do we have to settle for sub standard comic book super hero fare. The MCU put an amazing capstone on their Phase One endeavor, and they would move forward and continue to impress and build on this world with every outing. This film is a triumph in every way.Eric's Grade: A.","9/10"
"The Avengers","faisal_khatib","11 June 2012","Two weeks after everyone else saw 'The Avengers', I finally got around to watching the film last week. A lot has already been told about it by the gazillions of reviews on the internet today. This review will get lost among all that noise so I chose to keep it short and simple.Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) brings together a group of superheroes i.e. Iron Man () and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) along with SHIELD agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to have a face off with a global threat posed by Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his army of Chitauri.A run-off-the-mill story about the bad guy revealing himself in the first half by stealing something powerful; then the good guys get defeated in the first round to perform the knockout punch in the finale, with a post-credits scene promising a sequel. Where it stands apart is the brilliant execution on the part of director/writer Joss Whedon who not only manages to balance all the power packed characters into a dynamic package but creates what possibly could be the best adaption of a comic book into a superhero movie. He keeps the audience on the edge of the seat with intense action ranging from 'in your face' hand to hand combat and 'zipping around Manhattan' flying exploits.Robert Downey Jr. when not suited up plays Tony Stark with immense amount of ease and charisma. Chris Evans seems out of place, which goes well with his lost in time character while Chris Hemsworth seemed a little underwhelming in comparison to his solo film act. Samuel L. Jackson had more breathing space with a lengthier role which was good to see while Tom Hiddleston as Loki was impressive as the outnumbered villain.Mark Ruffalo was a refreshing change after the previous actors who played Bruce Banner, while the interpretation of Hulk was the perfect hurrah for this amazing comic character that's been long overdue. The respect it deserves on the big screen was a long time coming.Scarlett Johansson sheds her 'Iron Man 2' eye candy role for something more in line with what you'd expect from the savvy spy - Black Widow. Unlike the trailers, Jeremy Renner had more to do than I expected which was pleasing and it would be great to see a film about the back story of Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson's character.Background score, screenplay, cinematography, costumes, CGI were all top notch. Not a chink in the armor. Support from Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsg√•rd was more than adequate without turning into clich√© ridden monosyllabic characters that have plagued recent big budget films.The Avengers like someone on Twitter said, is the 'Star wars V (or was it VI?) of our generation'. A must-watch in the theatre though you can skip the 3D glasses if you want because I doubt it would reduce the awesomeness that is the film.","10/10"
"The Avengers","joechang-1","25 April 2012","I just want to tell you it is a great movie, go see it ASAP.We all have seen a lot of fake 3D movie in the past two years, I am very fed up with it, I can't believe they charged the same money as the Avatar! I think some movie makers should pay us back the money we spent, but for the Avengers it is money well spent! The 3D effect is marvelous.Avengers is the squeal to Thor (I am very sure) , unlike Battleship uses John Woo's style slowly cooking the oven (too slow sometimes), Avenger is like a hot knife cutting the butter ----> straight to the point, I just love it.To watch this movie is like riding the world's best roller-coaster, I guarantee you that you will love it as well!","10/10"
"The Avengers","SnoopyStyle","17 August 2013","Nick Fury brings together Earth's mightiest heroes to stop Loki who is unleashing an alien invasion.Robert Downey Jr. makes this good and Joss Whedon makes this great. Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang, and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together.Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun.","10/10"

"The Avengers","joshuadrake-91275","14 September 2015","The Avengers is a great movie and I think it's because of what they wanted to do with this film in Phase One of Marvel's cinematic universe and this movie pays off quickly.The action is just amazing and the final fight at the end is just top-notch. You already know what the plot is about so I don't have to go over it, but I will say that the story was light hearted and dark at the same time and you had some humor. The ending fight was the longest fight scene ever shown in this film.Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and he does get a lot of screen time. Chris Evans plays Captain America and he does an amazing job, Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner were both good as Thor and Hawkeye and they have done a very interesting job with their characters. Mark Ruffalo was cool as Bruce Banner / The Hulk and he does motion capture for the Hulk and it was really great to see him as a superhero. Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff and she could not done better in this film, but the one person who really was great is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's brother and he makes a good villain. James Spader is gonna do better as the title character, Ultron in the upcoming sequel in the 2015 Marvel Studios film, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", which will be released this Friday on May 1st, 2015 and it is really cool to hear and see him as Ultron.Aaron Taylor-Johnson is going to rock as Quicksilver, but I think Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's sister, Elizabeth, is hot as Scarlet Witch and she's gonna do great in that part, but Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is good in the screen time he has in this film, but he only has a cameo or small part in the new Avengers movie, which I will review on Friday May 1st, 2015 and I think it's going to be a good film to start off the summer 2015 movie season.The visual effects are really impressive and really cool in this movie, especially The Hulk in this film. The music by Alan Silvestri is fantastic and amazing. I could not believe the music that I heard in this film and it was amazing to hear it. The film's running time feels like it's three hours long, but it is only 2 hours and 42 minutes long, so the movie moves on very quickly.Overall, I love THE AVENGERS and I am giving it an 8 / 10. Marvel has outdone themselves with this film and they will continue to outdo themselves with other future Marvel movies and it's not like every day that a four-year plan pays off with such praise and hype, but this paid off wonderfully.","10/10"
"The Avengers","TheHonestCritic","27 January 2022","""The Avengers"" (2012), I remember when this movie was first announced, the hype for it was insane. Truth be told, I was probably just as excited as everyone else. Ever since I saw the post-credit scene in ""Iron Man"" (2008), I thought: ""no, are they really going to go in this direction?"" Sure enough, the ending of ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008) confirmed that they were building up to teaming up the Avengers. For the next few years, I was eagerly waiting for ""The Avengers"" to come out. Eventually, at long last, it was released. The wait was absolutely worth it, and then some. In fact, ""The Avengers"" was actually even better than I thought it was going to be! It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner and Thor are recruited by Nick Fury and the spy agency S. H. I. E. L. D. to stop Thor's brother Loki from taking over the world. Now, to some, that story may sound a little bit too miniscule. However, for a film of this caliber, a simple plot is warranted. It allows for extra character development, as well as better action and fight scenes. In some cases, that may be too many characters for one movie alone, and there's not too much character development. But, here's the thing, in the films leading up to this one, we already met these characters and know everything we need to know about them. That's one critical thing Marvel did correctly, they did individual superhero movies and built up to the team-up. Whereas DC did it backwards, and did the climactic team-up first then the individual films later. They just had the heroes run into the action without any character development. That's one of the biggest cardinal rules of cinema, in my opinion, character development. Without that, then the movie won't have any impact. Marvel did it all correctly, and stared with character development first, and that's what allows for ""The Avengers"" to shine even more. Unlike watching modern day DC films, when you watch Marvel movies, you actually care about the characters and what's going on. Any way, I won't go into any details about the plot. But, I guarantee that it's a story that you'll remember for the rest of your life. This film may be 142 minutes in length, but it goes by in the blink of an eye. When a long movie goes by fast, you know it's a winner! As far as the acting goes, it's just as outstanding as the story itself. The whole cast gives it their all with their performances. That's another thing Marvel superhero films do better than DC, acting. Good acting is critical for a movie to stand out. It just shows how passionate Marvel Studios is, and makes this film all the more enjoyable. The cast is absolutely insane, their on-screen chemistry is impeccable! All of the sets/locations are beautiful, and give the film an stunning atmosphere. They really help make it look like a real-life comic book! As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, being made in 2012! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Alan Silvestri is exceptional and his film score sets the perfect tone for the movie. Alan Silvestri is one of my top ten all-time favorite film score composers, and the soundtrack for this movie is no different. Every film score I've heard written by him is very well done, to say the least and this one here is no different. ""The Avengers"" is a phenomenal superhero movie, and it has found a place on my top five favorite Marvel films. It's still just as fun to watch today, as it was back when it was first released. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""The Avengers"", what are you waiting for? Go and see it today! Just skip it's sequel, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), that movie sucks and it's easily the worst Marvel Cinematic Universe film. But, before you see ""The Avengers"", I recommend watching the first few movies first. It'll make the payoff with this film much more worth it. If you don't watch ""The Avengers"", look out for Loki!","10/10"
"The Avengers","Joshua_Barry","26 April 2012","So they all come together to fight a battle they cannot fight on their own. They don't exactly get along or have much appreciation for each other to begin with, but this is what makes this film work. This has been a long time lead up, starting back in 2008 with Iron Man and then ever so slightly linking each of these individual films together. It has been a hugely lucrative series for Marvel, sometimes good and other times not so good, it has all been leading to this point.For me, the picks out of these previous films are Iron Man and Thor, with The Hulk behind that and then right at the bottom, Captain America. Iron Man was fantastically fun with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr.), the larger than life character who has it all. He is smart, witty, funny and extremely like able and loves what most boys do, his toys. With a great visionary director in Jon Favreau at the helm both the Iron Man films were extremely enjoyable. Thor, had a great cast in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston. Kenneth Branagh really captured the fun and excitement of the story. The second attempt at The Hulk was quite good, but Norton, as much as I love him was not quite the right choice. The CGI Hulk was never really there yet and always felt very animated and never part of the furniture. Captain American, as a movie didn't work for me. There was not enough about him to keep me interested, not enough fun had. I love Chris Evans and thought he was the right choice, but with a fairly dull script and a much too serious approach, I was quite bored by the end.Now the question was always going to be, can they work as a group? With the much needed change of Bruce Bana to Mark Rufallo, and a few additional characters thrown in, the answer is a gigantic yes! Joss Wheddon does an amazing job of keeping a huge number of characters in tune. It is always the toughest element in story telling and here it really had a huge potential of being jumbled and disjointed. It is none of the above and on the contrary it is, in its entirety, exceptionally well balanced. The banter between the characters is priceless and gives the film a consistent flow and usually arises in what would normally be fairly dull background scenes. Everyone is extremely good, but the newcomer Mark Rufallo shines as Bruce Bana and 'the other guy'. The special effects for The Hulk are incredible and they have finally got him pretty much perfectly moulded into his surroundings. With the CGI sorted and the right actor behind the green monster, he seriously works and almost steels the show. Not quite, but he certainly steels any scenes he is in. Downey Jnr. as Stark is his usual witty, charming self and sets the banter off with great timing and finesse. Newcomers to the series in Black Widow played by the luscious Scarlett Johansson and Hawkeye played by the always solid Jeremy Renner are both commendable additions and both fit in marvelously. Tom Hiddleston as Loku, the villain of this story, plays his part impeccably well and deserves much praise and respect for this outing.The special effects are superb and the fight scenes are tremendous. Joss Whedon has definitely shown he is an avid comic book fan himself. He shows that he is not afraid to have fun with his material, and this really is the whole point. Where Chistopher Nolan has brilliantly turned Batman into a dark knight, Whedon constantly lightens the mood, which really is the only way this type of ensemble film could work. There is never a dull moment as the pace of the film is constant and this makes for a hugely entertaining film in ever way. This really is a perfectly made comic book adaptation.Smart, witty, funny, and hugely entertaining! This action packed joyride is brimming with different personalities, huge egos and awesome super powers. They work together perfectly in this marvel from Marvel! Go Joss!! filmnotion.com","10/10"
"The Avengers","Samiam3","16 June 2012","The Avengers is almost the definition of good time at the movies. Not burdened with the need to spend great amounts of time on character origins, this superhero film takes a conveniently short amount of time to put the game in play, and once it does that, the game is played with flair and showmanship.Quite frankly, the plot itself is absurd, but I guess that was bound to happen when you combine the worlds of five different Marvel heroes. In less capable hands, the Avengers may well have ended up getting muddled from trying to do too much. With Joss Whedon in the director's chair, it's actually a very strait forward two hours with a good level of focus.While New York ends up getting the same treatment as much of Michael Bay's resume, the experience is far less superficial. the Avengers does not insult our intelligence. quite the opposite in fact, it embraces it. The Avengers' best quality is that it never ceases to wink at itself. This is a movie where even the villains the same quick fire one liners as the heroes. A good protagonist of course is also the difference between good action movie and good movie. Simply put, these people (or rather super people) are just good fun to be around. While none of them are ever quite fully rounded, when they come together as a team, they seem far less superficial than they did in their individual movies. with the exception of Iron Man, the films of Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, were not all that memorable when it came to characters. The Avengers makes you realize how distinctive each character is.One thing I was a little disappointed in was Samuel L. Jackson. While he is very much at home in the role he plays, it seems pretty obvious that he's just playing himself. Perhaps, there is a hidden positive in this. As a supporting character, you don't wanna upstage the people who have top billings. Personally, I think he could've given The Avengers a little bit more love.Last summer was a somewhat underwhelming year for superheros. It's a pleasure then to see a film like The Avengers fly in to save the day. It's a film made with love, and the work has paid off.","5/10"
"The Avengers","DanLawson146","20 November 2021","POSITIVES:1) The film is shot very well. It's always clear what's going on in the action scenes, and there are also plenty of long takes and swirling camera movements
2) This is the perfect sized group for the Avengers. It's large enough that they feel like a team capable of defeating Loki and his army, but small enough that every member can be fleshed out and have their own character arc
3) I thought it was actually quite brilliant how Nick Fury is able to manipulate the Avengers using Coulson's ""death"" and the Captain America playing cards. It makes the whole arc of the team splitting up and then coming back together feel completely believable
4) The film does a really good job of bringing together all the Marvel films that came before us in a satisfying wayNEGATIVES:1) It really bothers me how Hawkeye and Selvig conveniently become cured from Loki's control just by hitting their heads. The convenience of Bruce Banner being ""always angry"" and able to become Hulk whenever he wants for the final battle is also bothering me
2) How do they all communicate with each other when they aren't wearing ear pieces? It's so annoying
3) When Captain America and Iron Man have to go and fix the SHIELD ship, Cap is easily able to fix some type of circuit board - how would he know how to do that when he comes from several decades ago??4) The humour is far too frequent in my opinion. It becomes really annoying. Iron Man especially; I know he's meant to be a funny character but he just became irritating - it was too much.","10/10"

"The Avengers","vg40","1 May 2012","I would give it 7 or 7.5 out of 10. It is a very good film, but nothing great. Believe me or not. I watched it yesterday night at the South Delhi PVR Priya Cinema Hall (3D; hated their scratchy defective glasses which needed changing for many people).The first half was just okay (actually even boring) and the intermission point was so ill-timed and then the second half was good. The fight scenes in the city (Manhattan) are like the latest Transformers. A one time watch for sure; but don't expect much. I liked the film but not as much as I had expected it to like! There are many enthralling scenes but the number of boring frames (particularly in the first half) is also abundant. The villain is not so menacing or dignified (like the all-powerful villain of X-Men 3). He needed more teeth. And I am not alone in thinking so; five of my friends with me have similar opinion. You don't miss much if you miss the Avengers.","9/10"
"The Avengers","nerminmer","30 January 2013","Anyone gave 5 to 10 stars for this absurdity who is past 18th birthday , not a comic book publisher Marvel Fanboy and does have a girlfriend please raise your hand.No one ? Thought so. The movie is atrocious. There is a plot a plus compared Transformers movies but it is so simplistic and full of tropes , deux-ex-machinas ( I lost count how many times Loki's magic staff was used to explain everything and advance story from brain washing to destroy portal opening device ) , stereotypes , predictability and cheap juvenile PG-13 jokes it becomes a parody. I wonder that was the intention. Self mocking with movie concept , characters , genre etc. Because there is no way this movie goes unpredictable or might surprise you. Ending credits might have said ""From producers of Scary Movie"" or ""Meet the Spartans"" Final CGI explosion filled fight scene (another parallel to Transformers movies ) against alien invaders where no one was harmed due to rating was so messy with headache inducing 3D scenery you either had to get out of theater for fresh air or close your eyes and ears ( I did former ) The result is box office inflated animation due to marketing hype. Except CGI special effects overuse it has little cinematic quality. Actors try to make something out of their characters but child like character material gives them little chance on that.Comic book fan boys. Please stop comparing your live action stuff with Oscar winning material. You display your ignorance and make yourselves ridiculous. Cinema does not revolve around you. I am glad that you got your live action clip but for the rest %99 of us living on this planet who do not know know or familiar with resource material The Avengers was badly edited , predictable (and sometimes cringe worthy) movie. And I am using ""movie"" term very lightly here.","10/10"
"The Avengers","lewiskendell","14 May 2012","I loved Iron Man and Thor, enjoyed Captain America: The First Avenger, and was slightly disappointed in Iron Man 2. But even the best of those movies were just a lead-up to The Avengers, which is absolutely one of the finest superhero movies, and one of the most entertaining movies of any kind, that I've seen.This is pure summer blockbuster fun. And I don't mean that in a way that limits the movie, but instead as an example of the best of what a summer blockbuster can be. The story is rather straightforward: a massive threat to Earth that's too big for any of our heroes to handle alone, and a rocky road of butting egos and misunderstandings stands between them and working together as a team. It's clear, easy to follow, and only has the briefest moments of lost momentum. The Avengers feels like it's the perfect length, with no action scenes that drag on too long into mindlessness or uneven pacing.What struck me most about it was the humor. It carried the movie even more than the excellent action scenes, the well-handled exposition or the interplay between our heroes. The Avengers is outright hilarious at times. The laughs are woven organically throughout. The tone of the movie just feels right, which is probably the best compliment that I can give it.I must say that my expectations were easily surpassed by the first assembly of the Earth's mightiest heroes. Marvel definitely made the right decision to carefully lay the groundwork for The Avengers the past few years, and it paid off. And it helps immensely that they chose the right man to write and direct it. Can't wait for Avengers 2!","10/10"
"The Avengers","DunkelheitVZ","27 April 2012","I am a huge Marvel geek, so if you are not 100% into Marvel or superhero movies, you should take the following with a grain of salt: Avengers is everything I ever dreamed of and lived for. It is like I was a child again, watching in awe with my mouth wide open.Whedon nailed nearly every single scene. He made every superhero movie which is already out look very outdated. This movie is 140 minutes maybe and 130 minutes are money shots. I have to find new superlatives and words are still not enough if I wanted to describe my feelings. And after seeing the trailer and the pictures, I already had high expectations.The charisma of Captain America, the wild brutality of the Hulk, the majesty of Thor, it was all there. I was never the biggest fan of avengers, but right now, after writing these lines, I am going to read up some avenger comic books from my collection and we have 2 am.THIS is how you spend 200 million on a movie.","10/10"
"The Avengers","EthanBJones_03","23 May 2017","'The Avengers' was directed by Joss Whedon and stars Roberty Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Tom Hiddlesticks(Hiddleston if it actually bothers you). It's the end result of 5 previous movies, combined into one awesome spectacular entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When a charming, likable British villain tries to attack Earth with his giant disposable CGI space army forcing some mentor like figure to form a super team, consisting of the protagonists from 5 completely separate movies rolled into one. And thus we have a Cinematic Universe. Thanks Feige. Your brilliance had doomed us all. The Avengers is one of the most likable, enjoyable, fun action/superhero movies that's ever been released and redefined a genre. Without this movie, all the cinematic universes we have today wouldn't exist(the debate on whether that's good or not is still open) and a superhero movie on this scale would have been attempted. Don't watch this movie expecting 'The Dark Knight' or 'X-Men' because this movie centres fun as its #1 goal and excels at it. All the cast is likable, the action is fun and it is overall just a great, big fun way to spend 2 hours of you life.As much as I praise this movie, it does have some flaws. The main flaw is the dull, generic and clich√© ridden story which is just really poorly written. It follows the tropes way too closely and began the trend to have NO stakes in Marvel movies. I will also say the 'ending' should have had more of an impact and felt more important than it was so I would definitely say it should have been handled better. The end credits sequences are gold, though.Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man and is easily the best part of the MCU. On the flip side of this, I will say that I was very disappointed in Chris Evan's Captain America and I think his blatant lack of emotion and all times is unsettling and boring to watch. I understand the need of a straight man to keep the group in check but he was more like a robot than a human. Hiddlesticks was phenomenal as Loki and remains as easily the best MCU villain. He's smart, he's charming and, most importantly, he's British. That must be a requirement on entry to the 'Super villain Squad' because every villain in the universe is British(or at least the good ones are). Scarlett Johanson was good as Black Widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and Hawkeye. She may not be a critical member of the team but she's a female and yay for diversity. Mark Ruffallo was great as Bruce Banner and I adore how he refers to his alter ego as 'the other guy'. Jeremy Renner was fine as Hawkeye and remains the most useful Avenger with his SICK Archery Skills. Seriously though, he doesn't need to exist. Chris Hemsworth was good as Thor but not particularly memorable. Samuel Jackson is great as Nick Fury and a 15 rated movie of him would be comedy gold.The cinematography for this movie is great and I adore the tracking shots Whedon uses in the action and I think it benefits the action so much. Whedon CAN do action supremely well. The effects are amazing and are a delight to look at. The costume design was great and the set design was also really good. This movie needed to provide some fun action sequences, be funny and bring one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard Marvel fans. I can speak for two of them factors and say it achieved them. As for the third one, I can't comment but I will assume they were happy. In conclusion, this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movies of all time and is just great fun to watch. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend you do because it is pure, adrenaline filled enjoyment.9/10","6/10"
"The Avengers","cainita","16 April 2012","I have not bothered to write a review about a movie for a while, but this one deserves it. After seeing a screening of the film at Madrid, I can say that The Avengers is The best superhero movie ever made (TM). One of the reasons that make me think like this is that I didn't love all the individual films of the characters.Captain America was right, Thor is average but entertaining and a with an awesome casting, the Hulk only was interesting when the big guy smashed, the second Iron Man was awful.This film exceeds by far the sum of its parts.It is bright, cheerful, colorful. A film by gentlemen in pajamas punching bad guys. Even the Black Widow, totally plain in Iron Man, has a great girl power Whedon style role. It is full of references to the readers, but I swear that every one has a twist that makes them even more fun.Of course, you have some script inconsistencies, and failure to apologize for cursing! Is a comic of gentlemen in pajamas, not The Regent! It has both humor grateful to see the original version and I have no doubt that the dubbing stamina.I wanted to applaud, to cheer... I wish you a experience like mine, with all the cinema enjoying. It is an experience that reminds us that sometimes, just sometimes, a film is much more than watching alone a movie surrounded by other people.Some might say that the Batman movies are better. I would say they are even different genres. Spiderman 2 is the only superhero movie that genuinely, in my humble opinion, can compete.Nobody here is going to win an Oscar, but that does not mean that it can not win a special place in your hearts.And the post-final after the credits ... Okay I expected it. But here we have our final wink, the ultimate gift for those who have spent years reading Marvel comics. A subtle phrasing full of a meaning that only comic books fans will understand.","9/10"

"The Avengers","superindrajit","27 April 2012","I don't care about what some people say on how this movie just had action and no story and cheesy humor because those people obviously have no taste. Anyways, I just got a chance to see the most awaited film of 2012 and honestly, I wasn't disappointed. The movie was actually the most epic movie I have seen so far. Yes, I might change this decision after I see The Dark Knight Rises or MIB 3 but this movie has certainly impressed me. The movie has major plus points and one of them is the dialogs. The mix of action and humorous dialogs entertain and provide good moments to appease the audiences. I am sure, several people loved the dialogs but I just admired them. The action scenes, were not overdone and were certainly better than G.I Joe series which was not really anything impressive for me. But, there is a lot more to this film that gave me that feeling that this is the epic movie and It wasn't a waste to wait for so long. The action scenes are good, though there was a lot of explosions, they impress. The best part is the acting, our superheroes and even our villain say funny dialogs and perform good action. Plus, the story is effective for a 2 hour movie as many movies longer than 1 hour 30 mins are usually lagging in parts and fail to present a good story. But, this movie doesn't drag and doesn't make you fall asleep. Acting is top notch, Robert Downy Jr. is the best, Thor is good, Captain America, the rest are awesome. In general, this movie was damn good. I wasn't bored, and I enjoyed every freaking moment.","1/10"

It's a test of a good movie that late at night if your flicking through the channels you find yourself watching it, even if you have seen it so many times before.I am a proper comic book fan so to see my comic heroes transform into blockbuster movies is just something else. Prior to this I had been somewhat disappointed. Iron man was ok but Captain America was a kind of fun but boring and Thor was perfectly cast but quite poor. Hulk was well Hulk and a shambles. The Avengers tho was a wow. Great action, great interaction between cast, a new awesome hulk and what a villain in Tom Hiddleston's Loki. The final 45 minute Manhattan battle was simply superb. This movie really did re energise the franchise got Phase 2. Loved it.","9/10"
"The Avengers","x_manicure_x","24 August 2021","The Avengers didn't age well but is a highly entertaining movie regardless of your knowledge of its characters and universe. Sure it's cliche and super predictable just like any other superhero movie, but remember this is nothing that you should take seriously. It's just a big excuse to get all your favorite characters kicking each other's butts on screen with great special effects. Compared to all previous MCU movies it's very well-paced and while being fun and self-mocking it never gets to unbearable peaks of trashiness. The writing was surprisingly well-cared too this time. The characters have good chemistry, and each one of them gets introduced the right way, with the right amount of information being given still without getting too verbose. I still don't think that having Hulk suddenly being able to control his powers is a good idea though. It pretty much kills the whole concept of being indestructible but a threat to anybody around him at the same time. I understand that there are times he can't control himself when under stress like in the first part of the movie, but it's still too much of an easy card to play. Having the Avengers use his powers against the enemies but struggling to keep him in control at the same time would be more believable and balance the game better. Also Loki after being presented as the ultimate bad guy the first half of the movie gets completely lost after the aliens come in. Didn't feel his threat at all.","10/10"

Despite the years, its still super fresh and will probably never get old.","9/10"
"The Avengers","bob the moo","6 September 2012","You could be forgiven for approaching this film with trepidation for many reasons. The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film ‚Äì a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though, a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.Ironically enough though, the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines, rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didn't particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same, with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am), these aliens aren't really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection, Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it, giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the ""puny god"" moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans, who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk, again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces, none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes, nothing something that always delivers, but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful, busy, fun and generally very entertaining ‚Äì it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this.","8/10"
"The Avengers","osvazas","11 May 2012","I don't usually write reviews and I am not an expert on analyzing all that cinematographic stuff or how god of a job director did. All I can say is that I had a time of my life. It was an amazing film with an amazing storyline and amazing actors in it. When I first heard about the avengers, I was very happy yet skeptical about it. My biggest concern was how they were going to put all these legendary characters into one film and provide them all with enough screen time to achieve some character development. Even after seeing it I have no idea how they did it, but they not only did it they smashed it. Right from the start I was taken to a ride of my life, I could not take my eyes out of what was going on. In terms of special effect, it was top-notch as it was expected no question about it. People are praising this film for being very witty and having a lot of comedy in it, I have to say I am not a fan of comedy, but this film made me laugh more than any other comedy in a very long time. Having to see Hulk smashing Loki or Capitan America patronizing Iron-man, or Iron-Man fighting Thor, was something you could have dreamt of to see on the big screen when you were a kid. But having a chance to see it done and developed in such an effective and spectacular fashion was beyond my wildest expectations, and trust me I had very high hopes for this film. Well, sorry for not being very structured and coherent about the whole thing, I just wanted to share a little bit of joy and excitement that I have been provided with watching this amazing film. It's an epic masterpiece, and seeing it on the big screen is a one of those things you have to do before you die, that's for sure.","1/10"

"The Avengers","wavecat13","31 October 2019","I heard somewhere this was the first great Marvel flick, or this was the one to watch first, or something like that. Overall, it was entertaining but nothing special. The characters and story are pretty cliched. Some powerful object (a tesseract) falls into the hands of a malicious superhero (Loki, well played by Tom Hiddleston) and a crew comes together to try to get it back from him before he can pass it to the evil aliens who want to destroy Earth. They try to liven things up by creating some character and conflicts and the like, but for the most part it is a snooze. Downey's Iron Man is ironic and witty, Thor turns out to be the estranged brother of Loki, yeah yeah. These kinds of flicks are plug and play, get some star actors and plug them in, and so long as they look the part, things work out. It is fun to watch them flying around midtown Manhattan and smashing things up. The effects are the real stars.It is interesting to note that like our ancestors from previous centuries, the modern world wants to have its myths and its heroes - I guess old habits tend to stick around. But these myths mean very little and serve mostly to keep people's eyes glued to a screen.","8/10"
"The Avengers","maverick-352-622235","24 April 2012","The wait for this movie has been excruciatingly long, ever since we saw the preview that was attached to Captain America. Here's what I thought of the movie when I caught the premiere.You get the best of Joss Whedon and that is quite a lot:1. Black Widow is no longer just a piece of eye-candy. Did you seriously expect the creator of Buffy to just let his female characters stand around looking pretty? She kicks ass and how! (Yes, and it's about time!)2. For all the newbies out there that haven't watched some or all of the previous movies, the rest of the characters are thoroughly fleshed out. You get a long explanation about what they have been up to since their story last ended. So, it's possible that the first half may be a tad slow for the die-hard fans, but the second half more than makes up for it. Also, for what it's worth, isn't it better to know what the characters have been doing all this while, before they get down to some serious action?3. The post-credits scene. Oh My God! There is no point, whatsoever, in going to watch the movie if you don't wait for it. You simply HAVE to see it. 4. On a side-note, if you're relatively new to the Marvel universe, you must see The Superhero Squad Show (Yes, it's a cartoon, and no, it's not a very serious one either. But looking past all that, it's a serious refresher course in everything Marvel) before the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, as it really helps you understand the characters. I wouldn't have understood the importance of the post- credits scene without it. 5. The fight sequences (the gist of which we all saw over and over again at Comic-Con!) finally makes it look like we are watching a superhero movie. It's not one until some old-fashioned ka-pow!6. And yes, there are many scenes which are a fanboy's (or girl's) most awesome-est dream come alive!You also, however, get the worst of Whedon, which I admit, I pretty much dreaded. I won't say what it is, as it will spoil it for you, but it's really very obvious if you've seen anything of Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (my opinion may not, however, be accurate, as some might argue that what we've seen is actually, his best) Whatever the general consensus, there is no doubt that Whedon gives his best shot at leaving his mark in the Marvel 'verse (!) and his best is pretty darn good!If I simply HAVE to find flaws in the movie, the only one I can think of right now is that some important Avengers - Ant-Man, Wasp, Black Panther and Vision - are nowhere to be seen. Black Widow was the only token female in this all-testosterone group, so Wasp would have been a welcome addition, as the scales would not be so unbalanced.The Avengers works because underneath all the larger-than-life heroes with their huge egos, their actions and emotions are just human enough to be believable. Things do not just fall in place - everybody does not magically get along with each other and fight away to glory - they had to work hard to make it happen. And that, is this movie's biggest USP.All-in-all, go watch the movie, if not on the first day, then at least some other time for as long as it's on in the theaters. Your first glimpse of this movie just HAS to be on the big screen.","6/10"

"The Avengers","DubhDoo","17 June 2012","So here it is. After nearly fifty years, The Avengers have finally made the transition from page to screen, and best of all, it does not manage to disappoint. Much of this is down to Joss Whedon and the pitch-perfect casting.At first, the choice of Whedon as director surprised me somewhat. I really like Whedon, don't get me wrong, but with a background in television and his most notable cinematic efforts being the screenplay for the first 'Toy Story' and the unfortunately overlooked 'Serenity', he struck me as an odd choice. But make no mistake, that even with millions more dollars at hand, Whedon fortunately remains true to himself; keeping humour in sight, with plenty of instantly quotable quips and wisecracks throughout. He is confident and assured with these treasured characters, managing to juggle all these superheroes (and one super ego).We're all used to (most of ) the cast members by now; Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Chris Evans as Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Tom Hiddleston as Loki; but we also have some new players in the form of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as Hulk. What is most brilliant is that all the actors impress. I was eagerly anticipating seeing Evans as Rogers again, after falling in love with his solo effort, but it was in fact Ruffalo who struck me the most. His portrayal as the tortured Bruce Banner was nuanced, believable and very human, applying emotion to a difficult role. Hiddleston was true pleasure as the villainous Loki, giving a fantastic performance and wonderfully delivering many great lines.One quibble I had was Hawkeye's lack of screen-time, but that can be ignored as I suspect he will either get a spin-off or have a larger role in the sequel. This is the very opposite to say Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy; instead of being dark, realistic and multi-layered, this is the very synthesis of a big, bright summer movie, a blast from start to finish with humour and large action sequences. While Loki's army were a bit too Transformers-esque for my liking, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film, and exited the cinema with a satisfied smile on my face. Overall, an excellent blockbuster which deserves the praise it's getting. All I want is for Whedon to the sequel.","10/10"

"The Avengers","achyutaghosh","27 April 2012","The elders say that two is company, anything more is just a crowd. Avengers shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore, and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas! With an ensemble star cast, a fast, witty script, thrilling action sequences, and masterful direction, it is the perfect superhero movie, one which will charm not only the nerdy fans, but also the uninitiated.The Avengers project began over 6 years back, when Marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen, but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first. Each of them were characterized by action, humor and a certain degree of insaneness. The movies generated big bucks at the box office, but i always felt Marvel was holding back something- whether the grandness of plot, or the scale of action. This is what it was saving for, no holding back for the $220 million mother of all actioners, Avengers- 6 superheroes, one mental Norse God, a full scale alien invasion- this one has got it all.The story picks up plot strands from the previous movies- Loki steals the Tesserect, a cube like artifact which is a source of great power, which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade Earth. Post credit scenes in the older Marvel movies show that Nick Fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day- where the Earth will be ""hilariously out gunned"" and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team. To form an unbeatable squad, each superhero gets something to the table- Hulk brings the muscle, Captain America brings strategy, Ironman brings style and technology, Thor brings emotion along with Godlike fury, Hawkeye brings steely sincerity and Black Widow brings smoking-hot sexiness. But before they can take on Loki and his minions, they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team. Much of the film's uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes. The climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last year's Transformers- dark of the Moon, but is infinitely more enjoyable, each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team, each sequence bettering the previous one. The movie's biggest strength is its star cast- Robert Downey as Ironman, continues from where he left off in Ironman 2- ""billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist""- he calls himself, as he lends sarcastic humor to an ""oh so serious"" group. Chris Evans as Captain America might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity. Chris Hemsworth as Thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil, while Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson as Hawkeye and Black Widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the A-team. However the scene stealers were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Hiddleston's Loki. Ruffalo is probably the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, and while Edward Norton and Eric Bana played the role with intensity, Ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humor. Trust me, with or without pants, the Hulk will keep you in splits, but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the Hulk delivers the coup de grace to Loki. Loki's expression immediately after- priceless :) Speaking of whom, the star of the movie IS Loki- a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain (think Joker in the dark Knight or Doc Ock in Spiderman 2)- and in Avengers, Hiddleston plays Loki in a manner that man to man, he stands head and shoulders above the heroes. This Loki, like most super villains has a sinister, single point agenda- to rule the world, and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him, in of all places, Germany- not-so-long-ago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world. When Loki is captured and held in a glass cell, he gives a little bit of the Hannibal Lecter treatment to Scarlett.You do a far better job if you love what you do, and director Joss Whedon is a certified geek, having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series. The biggest input that Joss Whedon brings, is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it- ""hold on"", he seems to say, ""the solution is just round the corner""- it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously, unlike the DC Comic adaptations. Avengers is a celebrity jamboree of sorts, and yet Whedon manages to give each star his place, each character, his due Avengers weighs in at 146 minutes, but to his credit, Whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout, whenever things begin to sag, jokes, punchlines, and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong. To sum up, Avengers is a superlative effort. Mixing fantasy, science fiction, imagination, colorfully dressed he-men, this is the film Marvel fans have been waiting for ages- they took their time, but they delivered on all counts. This is a no holds barred, effects driven, mass appeal blockbuster par excellence, absurdly entertaining- these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in Asgard for geeks such as me, and will sure extend its magic to the non fans. There are so many characters, yet it never felt too many, production values are solid, the script engaging, with loads and loads of nonstop action. There are minor flaws, but this is THE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER OF THE YEAR. Geeking out has never been so much fun.","9/10"
"The Avengers","ssvfolder-1","14 June 2019","How is that this movie is so good even after masterpieces of phase three? I re-watched it two times in a row (which makes it a total of 6) and still loved every moment of it. If I have to guess it's the amazing chemistry between the actors and a great writing (unlike awful Game of Thrones,season 8), which makes it tick. There are no grade A actors in it , aside perhaps Robert Downy Jr. and Sam L Jackson, yet in this one, every one is a star. Both Evans and Hemsworth embrace their role to perfection and aren't just a pretty face. They are captain America and Thor respectively, and I cant' imagine anyone else in that role. A typical acting of Mark Ruffalo, actually works perfectly and one might say that he did his difficult role of Hulk even better than Ed Norton, whom I personally consider to be one of the best, though notoriously known difficult to work with, actors. Scarlet Johanson Gave a superb performance and for me this is one of her best movies ever. Not to forget everyone else, who gave an outstanding performance. This movie is not without its flaws, yet the sheer enjoyment and inspiration it provides, makes up for it. I will give it a 10/10 rating, as this is a movie that started an Avengers craze for me, so all the other movies, even the bad ones, fall into their place in this epic movie series.","3/10"
"The Avengers","davek28","16 October 2012","I don't usually comment on a film for which I'm completely neutral, but this film deserves a neutral comment as it's such a waste of time and money. It exhibits the typical American obsession with violence and little or no character development. After fast-forwarding through all the crash bang wallop scenes and still keeping track of the plot, I still didn't care what happened to anyone, including the planet.Scarlet Johansson is completely miscast as the Black Widow. She should be tall and willowy. Mark Ruffalo is perfectly cast as the Hulk as it suits his style of acting, which is usually dumb.I really am a fan of Joss Whedon and own the entire Buffy collection, but I counted two - maybe three - snappy lines of dialogue in this. Very disappointing.I was going to give it 5 out of 10 but decided it deserved 6 towards the end - barely. Just too corny for words and silly in the extreme.","9/10"
"The Avengers","jrwilson7","27 April 2012","Everybody take note! The superhero film genre has just been ramped up a gear or two, in fact, someone has rammed the throttle into overdrive and that someone is Joss Whedon. For those of you who don't know who this man is, he's been around a while, but not as famous as other directors. First and foremost, he is a writer. We have him to thank for films like Toy Story, Titan A.E., Atlantis and Alien Resurrection. He is also the writing and directing genius behind TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Dollhouse and the short lived Firefy (among others) and he is no stranger to directing big action movies. He helmed the Firefly spin off movie, Serenity. But, this is Whedon's first big feature film, it's also his first blockbuster and there is a lot riding on the success of this film.The Avengers is a long time coming. There have been numerous directors attached to it, a number of scripts, and of course, six other films preceding it (I am including the original Hulk). Making it work has been no easy task. Each character has their own successful film franchise (Thor 2 and Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 are due out in the next two years) with plots, subplots and narratives that have loosely been tied together with short end-of-credits scenes involving Nick Fury and the Avengers Initiative.In the first issue of the comic , the team are assembled to fight Thor's brother Loki who has used his power of illusion to persuade the Hulk onto a part of destruction. Whedon has used these elements as his inspiration to create a strong script and storyline that successfully pulls together some of cinemas biggest personalities (and egos) and not only develops their characters further but broadens their appeal.The story is over the top, but not enough that you find yourself scoffing. The reality is that you need to suspend disbelief when dealing with characters from other worlds, aliens and magic! And considering the source material lends itself to be over the top anyway, the beauty in Whedon's script is that it never once takes itself seriously. (SPOILER) Even when S.H.E.I.L.D.S super-sized aircraft carrier turns into a flying invisible fortress, Nick Fury states, ""Let's dance"" as reflectors cover the ships surface much like a mirror-ball, rendering it completely invisible to the naked eye! Over the top? Hell Yes! The first act sees the assembly of the Avengers. The Cap and Bruce Banner are asked to find Loki and the Tesseract he has stolen from Shield. Later Thor and Iron Man join the team with Hawkeye and Black Widow. What works well is that when the four superheroes and superegos come together, each thinks they will save the day, but as their egos compete against one another for attention, the typical alpha-male muchoness comes to the fore, causing disunity and damage ‚Äì a lot of damage!It is not until part the way through the second act that the team pulls together for the greater good, which is to save humanity from total destruction at the hand of Loki and his alien army.The script is what makes this film and is proof that studios should trust ""fan boys"" with comic book adaptions. Whedon has used his extensive knowledge and passion to write a story that is appealing to all audiences while combining what we love from the original films. There are plenty of references to the ""prequels"" and the character traits each has developed and bring with them and for the fans, easter egg references to the comics to satiate their appetite. It is film is funny. Very funny. The Hulk almost steals the show (spoiler) when he throws Loki around like a ragdoll during his ""I am a God"" speech, but each character gets a few choice lines that will surely become part of our vernacular. At times I thought I was in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, considering the scale and grandeur of the film's final act ‚Äì the near destruction of New York. Although there are hallmarks to DOTM, Avengers is nothing like it, in fact, Whedon proves he is the better director by piecing together huge battle sequences, action, explosions, while ensuring that each character has plenty of screen time that not only makes sense, but doesn't get lost in the enormity and scale of it all.The production flawlessly merges CGI and live action together, but the 3D conversion leaves little to be desired. Considering the success of Tron Legacy, I am surprised Disney (who owns Marvel) didn't pull out all the stops and have it filmed in 3D.I have long appreciated Whedon's film making abilities and here he channels the work he made famous in Serenity, those fast zoom shots of ships exploding are used here, but not overdone. He also shoots action from interesting and random angles often panning through the back of destroyed cars and broken windows and styling shots that replicate comic book frames, which many fans will appreciate, but most will miss.The Avengers proves that comic book adaptions can work in the right hands and that screenwriters and directors need to have some understanding of what they are working with.This is the BEST comic book ‚Äì SUPERHERO ‚Äì film I have seen and is the mark by which all future films will be judged by.","3/10"

"The Avengers","marcm-8","22 July 2012","Guess I expected more but shouldn't from a comic book company. I did think that much of the acting was above par and quite good in many instances. However, the poor relationship to obeying or at least extending the laws of physics was just inexcusable. I'll try to precisely explain my sentiments: 1) what's the logic in having an aircraft carrier fly? A runway on a ship that's supposedly capable of flying? If it's possible to make a ship like that fly, then wouldn't it also be possible to have other flying craft that don't need a runway? Get a scientist to review your scripts before hand!2) The scant one-liners from Robert Downey, Jr's character were annoying at best. Guess he's an ADD/ADHD character trying to appeal to multitude of ADD/ADHD fans?3) All the hand waving over and around computer screens reminded me of the bad attempt at impressing the viewer that occurred in ""Minority Report"" Make the hand waving meaningful and minimal. If those screens were really needed, then Dr. Banner/Hulk would have gotten some use/knowledge or gained something from all his hand waving over supposedly touch-sensitive screens. Yet, both he and Mr. Downey (and others) seems obsessed with waving their hands around - for what? I did enjoy Samuel Jackson's character when he responded to the lame navigator's excuse ""the navigation system is reinitializing..."" and he says is the ""Sun up, then put it on your left"" That was the most genuine moment in the whole film.I expected the superior plot and complexity of ""Thor"" but was sadly disappointed with an rehash of ""Independence"" style special effects and a lame story of alien invaders. All this mediocrity probably didn't impact the title's earnings. I just won't be so enthused about catching a sequel. Maybe worth a Netflix or video store rental but not a theater ticket!","3/10"
"The Avengers","swiftnick47","26 April 2012","Everything just worked perfectly for The Avengers. My geek heart jumped several times during the movie. So many cool and memorable action scenes, great comic timing, It is just epic in every way. The overall story is simple (evil guy wants to dominate earth), but it doesn't matter because it still carries depth due to the previous movies which are tied together seamlessly with this one. The chemistry between the actors are perfect, and skeptics don't worry, Caps suit is not bad looking at all and there is a perfectly fine explanation for why it does not look as high tech shiny as the rest of The Avengers, but for that one, you need to watch the movie. Experiences like this is why cinema is still the best place to watch epic action movies, and The Avengers is nothing but EPIC!","4/10"

It's just damn fun. And without any agendas pushed down our throat all the better for it!!!All the characters are great here, the evil Loki, grand Thor, proper Captain America, and even hawkeye, hulk and black widow are better than I remembered.

"Avengers: Infinity War","RJBrez","24 January 2021","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end. Enjoy!","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","0U","23 February 2020","This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists.

Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.","10/10"

Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","uzair-36867","8 February 2021","This film is an achievement unto itself. Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","andreascaloni","16 February 2021","Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster.

Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.Rating: 9.6.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Abdulxoxo","5 February 2021","Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.
Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.","8/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","Puroo","21 April 2021","It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.","10/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","Filmdokter","25 October 2021","#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.","8/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Jesper2801","26 April 2018","I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","shawneofthedead","25 April 2018","Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero m√™l√©e that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Platypuschow","4 May 2018","Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","cartermain","20 January 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours.

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheLittleSongbird","2 May 2018","Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","garethvk","24 April 2018","Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.

"Avengers: Infinity War","jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","12 June 2018","Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.","8/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","eva3si0n","8 January 2021","The first Marvel film I really liked. Surprisingly in the film there are many spectacular scenes, which are well held and the main transition between them is made seamless, which does not make you miss.

After re-watching Infinity War multiple times it still gets me because it's sad the ending really is just another cinematic masterpiece which Marvel always pull off and the fight scenes are amazing.

"Avengers: Infinity War","ACollegeStudent","17 December 2021","Rating: 9.0This went where no other mainstream superhero movie went and killed everyone, allowing Thanos to win. The biggest flaw I can think of with this is that there are other ways to achieve Thanos's goal without killing everyone, and there were some plot grievances like Corvus Glaive somehow sneaking all the way to Shuri in the battle unnoticed, and them not just digging under Wakanda's shield to begin with (they did later in the battle). Also, destroying an infinity stone should cause the universe to collapse in some way as explained in Endgame about taking stones from universes, so I'm not sure why none of the main cast raised this issue when destroying the mind stone was ratified into their gameplan (they might have not known better, though). Otherwise, great pacing, a great soundtrack, crisp visuals, seamless comedy, a compelling and humanized villain, and a haunting ending.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Dello_","6 September 2021","Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.","10/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","pjgs200","12 May 2018","I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10.","7/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Horst_In_Translation","4 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once.I think that movies, especially superhero films, often stand and fall with their villain and here we have Thanos played by Josh Brolin as the main antagonist and he is just utterly great and memorable. Maybe you could say that his (self-perceived godly) ambition to erase half the planet is a bit too mathematical, but everything else about him is outstanding and I have virtually no doubt that he will end up as one of the most memorable villains of the movie year 2018. Even in his weaker story lines, like the part with his ""daughter"" that does not feel entirely convincing early on, he shines and elevates the material to a level where it really saves this entire part of the movie. So yes huge thumbs-up for Thanos. And another thumbs-up for virtually everybody else. Except Starlord unfortunately because honestly his grief may have been huge, but the how he basically destroyed the Avengers' effort that had them close to victory was just ridiculous, so to some extent you can blame him for billions of people dying eventually. Or are they really? I believe there will be a new Avengers movie in 2019 by the same team of writers and directors, so the ending may not be as finite as it seemed to be. You can almost call it a duology. Is all hope really lost? We have to wait a year and see. Honestly I doubt it because there will be a Black Panther 2 for sure at some point, so I guess they will find a way to get things right again for the good guys. It will also be interesting to see if they bring back those who died earlier too, not just those that vanished at the very end.Anyway, this film we have here is one that will make a huge impact come awards season 2018/2019 in all technical categories, especially Visual Effects where it is maybe a lock for an Oscar nomination with a great chance to take home the win. Another thing I would like to say about this film is that it is also a triumph in terms of the comedy, which is not always a success in Marvel works. But here there are some really hilarious scenes and as many bad things as I said about Chris Pratt's character earlier, his banter with Thor is hilarious. And there is a lot more of course. Drax is also amazing in that one scene where he stands there doing nothing. You will recognize many other pretty funny moments when you see them. So what is it that made this film so amazing. I would say it is the script this time. It is bold, daring and not scared of anything while never becoming too absurd or unrealistic (and yes that is possible for superhero films *cough* Deadpool *cough* glad we did not see him in here). But the outcome here is the exact opposite of too many cooks spoiling the broth, both character- and writer-wise. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this one and good thing is you really don't need to have seen any other Avengers or Marvel movie to appreciate the quality we were given with this one. I am truly very curious about the sequel and cannot wait to check it out. This third Avengers movie is my favorite 2018 release at the point of April. And it has a huge chance to stay in the top5, probably top3 until the end of the year. It never dragged, which is always a success for this running time and it gets better by the minute the longer it goes. And the way things turn out eventually reminded me a bit of the last Wolverine film ""Logan"". Happy endings are no longer essential. Realism is what it is all about. Highly highly recommended.","8/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","MrDHWong","25 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","numenorsniper-66396","25 November 2021","I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","r96sk","23 January 2021","This is exactly the sorta thing I want from an Avengers film! Full blown, no punches pulled action. In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!Despite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.Like 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.Speaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.There are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.Needless to say, I can't wait to see 'Avengers: Endgame'!","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","vengeance20","8 May 2018","Seriously when are these editors going to get their crap together & cut it! Hm? You don't need to drag a film on & on for what seems like an eternity! Cut the crap! Cut it! Get to the point already!!As usual, story-line was confusing, too wrapped up with own issues other than saving peoples lives, which is what these films have missed the point of over time, not to mention bad editing, & poorly executed narrative. They weren't speaking English as I had no idea what they were talking about half the time or should I say most of the time! Maybe if they cut the cra[ & made the film snappy it probably would've made more sense & instead of dragging the climax out in such a choppy changing like manner (what climax, I'll get to that later) anyway, as well as repetitive, the climaxes ending was all over the place! Bad guys gets ""killed"", comes back again, gets killed, comes back, more chopping & changing, then a slow dragged out scene, then back to the climax! The end outstayed its welcome, & well as soon as it got to the 2hr mark, you knew they need to wrap it up, but it took another 40mins to do that! Damn!And the ending... don't make me laugh!! The ending could've happened much much sooner! So much so they dragged out a climax for this? I mean the ending was an insult alone, without the other reason being that it took them nearly an hour till they gave us this pile of horse crap! Oh my god!!Overall crap! DON'T watch! 2/10","2/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","593PMP","19 June 2018","I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","lisafordeay","6 May 2018","OK I loved the sequel Age Of Ultron as it focused more on the Avengers themselves but I will get into the negatives later.Avengers Infinity War is the prequel to the 2015 film and tells the story of the Avengers who are no longer working together and must try and defeat a giant half monster/ human called Thanos (Josh Brolin)who wants the stones known as the infinity stones. Each one makes Thano more powerful and it's up to the team to somewhat get back together and join the guardians of the galaxy(Chris Pratt, Zoe Salvada,Bradley Cooper). Will they stop Thano?The special effects are very good along with the cinematography. However the film itself is 50/50 for me. The downside of this film was that there was too much going on and I was so dissapointed with the hulk played by Mark Ruffalo as you never see him as the hulk at all this time. Jermery Renner who played Hawkeye was absent in this and the film was so hard to follow e.g what happened to Thor's eye. I felt like it was skipping or whatever.Overall do yourselves a favour and watch the 2015 version instead or try and watch all the Marvel films to get used to the story.Also has Tom Holland,Robert Downey Jr,Gwyneth Paltrow,Don Cheadle,Chadwick Boseman,Karen Gillian and even a cameo by Stan Lee.","5/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","blparker-31738","27 April 2018","All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","TheBigSick","4 May 2018","SPOILER: The plot is simple that the supervillian succeeds, but Russo brothers waste too much time on piling up the superheroes. The film is just too long, and you keep looking at the watch to see when it will end. There are too many characters, and if you did not view the previous Marvel films, you would hardly get any sense of who they are. It is an OK film for Marvel fans, but chaos for a general audience.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Prismark10","3 May 2018","When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.","6/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","saraccan","11 May 2018","If i can somehow oversee the fact that this is just another glorified cgi fueled version of wwe, its an okay action movie.It's still very much soulless, incredibly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie matters in any way because there can be infinite amounts of prequels and/or sequels and also, certain people can control time in any way they desire. I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters.Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of ""wait, where are we?"" or ""wait, why are they fighting again?"". This one felt more compact to me. GOOD JOB!That said i still don't care about anything that happened or will happen in these superhero movies. I did pay for a ticket and therefore contributed to the financing of future films though, so you're welcome.","2/10"

The Hulk grapples with Thanos and is overpowered to the point where he is afraid to come out through Banner? Are you serious? Where is CA? He lost his razor AND his shield? Are you serious? Most of the things I expect from the Avengers were absent in this film. There was very little working together to defeat a Foe; and way too much about the Bad Guy -- Thanos. Like, why do I care? Thanos is the Bad Guy, so defeat him and move on! Then the Ending --- utterly pathetic!","6/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","RNMorton","9 May 2018","Two other titles came to mind as I watched this. ""The sum is much less than the parts"", and/or ""Way too much on the plate"". As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.","6/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","georgewilliamnoble","3 May 2018","Sometimes in this life there are things beyond criticism, the Mona Liza for example or Turners rain steam and speed or Chaplin in The Kid. Masterpieces all, no debate right?
Then there are products is one soap powder really better than this other, or a $1000 perfume can it really be better say than one at a mere $10, beauty they say is in the eye of the beholder! So they say. Then there is this new mega movie Avengers Infinity War, now i would take issue with anyone that this is actually a movie at all, it is a consumer product the must see/ have accessory for the moment, Pre-sold, Pre-packaged to a ready made audience desperate to spend their money, it is just another fashionable element in today's throw away age. Telephones i believe are sold this way, at least this is how i see the commercial world of now. Now, i know my views are in total opposition to the frankly ridiculous high score's on this web site, and please don't think i am not grateful, my local multiplex needs big profit films to survive and hopefully prosper so the likes of me can see proper films that are real cinematic experiences but make next to no money, usually that's the fate of most superior films these day's! 
Can i be positive in any way about this Marvel, well i saw it in 4DX & 3D, the chair swam and jolted, there were lights, flashes, and sprays or did i imagine the last one, oh yes, the sound was loud, very very loud. and Oh yes do not forget, it is extremely long, very very long, like a bad flight across the Atlantic but without the benefits of a helpful service attendant's tray. Did i enjoy it? in any way, well no, just too much of a good thing, i like sugar in my tea, but 32 spoons is to much! This i will call it for ease, a film, it just had too much of everything. Now, i can just imagine steam boiling over from most readers that i am clearly to old and out of touch, but i argue not so, the trailer for Deadpool 2 was so funny and inventive that i am eagerly awaiting this release. As for all these many many super hero's to numerous to remember and to numerous to mention, i do have a question for superhero's obviously adoring public the question is, are the comic books any better?","4/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","brianjohnson-20043","8 May 2018","I like the stand alone Marvel Movies more, but it almost feels like an obligation to see all of them if you want to see the ones you like, or else, you'll have no idea what's going on when the ones you like continue. I'm prefacing with that so readers understand that I'm not just a hater.First off, I want to address the villain. My opinions I've heard/read asserted Thanos is a strength to this film. I found that to be the opposite. I found his motivation more convincing than the Justice League villains, who were so bad, I can't even really remember their motivation, and a bit less stupid than Ultron who was the AI thing that might have seemed like a real issue in the 80s or early 90s. But today it seems clear that the misuse of technology to our demise is going to be gradual rather than sudden. The vulture from Spider Man Homecoming, or the villain from Black Panther were much more compelling In my Opinion. Thanos felt like a cartoonish version of the villain Samuel Jackson played in the first Kingsmen movie. Except that Thanos didn't work like how the similar villain in Kingsmen worked. They're both trying to save everything by killing off a sizable chunk of people before people kill their planet or planets. The difference is that Thanos wants to randomly and painlessly kill half of everyone everywhere, and Valentine wants to save a few chosen wealthy friends. Overpopulation and idiocy is a real issue on earth. But in the Marvel Universe, it's a planet to planet issue, and it seems stupid to just kill off half of everyone on some planets which might not have any actual problems. And this issue is never even questioned by any of the characters. They just try to play the card that Thanos should try to save people, not kill them. Not a bad point. But it didn't seem like any of the Avengers seemed even remotely interesting in addressing Thanos' concerns. Not even Gamora. Plus, if someone gets two or three of these infinity stones, let alone all of them, can't they use that person yield that power to do good rather than evil? It just didn't settle very well with me. Loki was a much better villain because he's like the Joker. Destruction and chaos is his high. That's a real thing in people that an audience should be able to understand.The strength of this movie is the humor. I laughed repeatedly and was certainly entertained in that regard. It also, no surprise, looked really good and had great music. I was surprised how well the Guardians characters fit in with the other Marvel characters. But to me a feature length movie, even a short one, can't be good if the story isn't compelling. And this movie is long. If the villain's story was halfway decent it would have stood a good shot, but just getting characters together that one likes and making a spectacle, won't make up for giant flaws in the story. I didn't expect everything to be concluded, because these movie all set up more to come. But with an ending like this film has, it should have been advertised as the 1st part of 2 movies from the start. I really don't get how the next Ant-Man movie is going to work after what happened here in Inifinity Wars. Unless it takes place prior to the events of Infinity Wars, I don't see it working. But if that's the case, why not have Ant Man 2 come out first? I'm not a comic book reader. I open them up, look at the picture and think:""I'm supposed to take these silly-looking overdramatic characters and pictures seriously? Do other people see how goofy these images are? What am I, 10? But I've heard from friends who like the comics that much of the events of this film unfolded as they did to stay loyal to the events in the comics. My response to this is that every form of entertainment's first goal should be to work within its own form. To me Infinity Wars' narrative doesn't work for a feature movie. I was upset with how it ended. And I know I wasn't the only one in the theater upset. And I find it disgraceful that, at the moment, this movie has 8.9 stars out of 10. Black Panther doesn't have 8 and it's actually good. What's wrong with people? This movie is currently ranked ahead of movies like 12 Angry Men, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, It's a Wonder life, American History X, The Prestige or Every Single Pixar Movie. What is wrong with people?","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","hawkins_saints_rock","25 April 2018","Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable. The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them. My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it. Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves. 9.8/10","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","eden-rabatsch","25 April 2018","Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.","3/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","nodlimax","28 April 2018","This movie has various problems and the first major one is the lack of focus. We keep jumping around to various places and I can't even keep where all of them were.One moment, we are on earth, the next on Knowhere, the next on some other planet to which I can't even remember the name. And it's not just the places, it's the characters too. There isn't one lead or even 5 lead characters we can somewhat focus on. They try to focus on everybody which means nobody is the actual lead character. There was another movie that was initially praised but in the end was heavily critizised for lacking focus on a real main character - that was Star Wars The Phantom Menace. I see the same problem in this regard here with the story.Due to the lack of focus the movie also has pacing issues and therefore to me felt boring. And then this goes on for 150 minutes. And the biggest problem at the end of the movie is that there is no payoff.......ok stop, I have to correct myself there. The payoff (here comes the spoiler) is, that the bad guy wins. Everything the heroes tried to do failed and you know what I was actually kinda rooting for Thanos, because I couldn't care enough about any of the other characters. He became the protagonist for me, which makes me feel terrible as well, because he kills half the population in the universe.In the end I was just happy that the movie was over. However the writers put themselfes in a corner. Thanos is pretty much god at this point and objectively speaking there is no way anyone could defeat him at this point except if they go for something like ""his glove lost the power after he used it"" which is cheap. That will then result in the heroes trying to get back the time stone and then turning back time or something similar stupid.I will not see the next one in cinema. At this point I am pretty much done with superhero movies. I guess I can thank Disney now for first pushing me away from Star Wars and now Marvel.The effects and sound were decent though.","6/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","deastman_uk","28 April 2018","How long has it been since the Dark Knight? The DC film that defined how an epic comic book fantasy could wrap a world around a hero and a villain.Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.","1/10"

The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence.

"Avengers: Infinity War","Lursa","6 May 2018","SPOILER ALERT!!
I am a Marvel Chick. I totally dig the whole Marvel Verse and wave my 'fangirl flag' proudly. I was looking forward to this movie so much...then something happened. I went to see it today. I did not read any of the reviews before I went. I never do. I always view a film without input from folk that usually don't know what I like. So there I was, popcorn and coke in hand. Two rows back from the screen ('cause I'm into total immersion, okay) in my reclining seat. Ten minutes in and I know we're in trouble. It's not the fact that two of my favorite characters didn't survive the opening credits. This is Infinity War, right? People are gonna die. It's just seemed so pointless. Loki dies but Thor survives? How is that fair? Hemdall dies saving Hulk of all people?? Not that I'm hatin' on Hulk...but come on, Hemdall! You have sworn an oath to the 'Thone of Asgard' and you don't save EITHER of the princes? Really?? I know Hulk is refusing to 'come out' after Thanos kicks his butt that no one ever has before but still...The movie goes rapidly downhill from here. Thanos and his twisted cult of psychopaths got on my nerves early and they danced all over them until the end of the film. We bounce all over the world (and off it) to keep Thanos away from the Infinity stones. Who decided that two of the most important stones be 'hidden' on earth? Not a good idea. Our Merry Band of Marvel Heroes needs to take a page out of the Star Trek verse. 'The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few or the one.' This could have saved SO many lives. Loki gives Thanos the Tesseract to save Thor. Thanos tried to kill them all anyway. Actually succeeds in killing both Loki, Hemdall and all of the Asgardians. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, the daughter he loves. (Thanos has a really weird idea of what love entails...but whatever) He does this so he can gain access to the Soul Stone. Dr. Strange gives Thanos the Time Stone to save Tony Stark. (Tony Stark? Wasn't his expiration date up like a couple years ago?? ) This gives Thanos the power to turn back time whenever he wants. Which he does after Scarlett Witch kills Vision (her lover) to destroy the Mind Stone. He just turns back time. Rips the stone out of Vision's head and heads off to wipe out life as we know it. So Scarlett Witch went through all that gut wrenching heartache for nothing.This could have been a good movie. Maybe even a great one but it's not. It's a mishmash of the worst parts of just about every Marvel movie over the past 10 years. There are a few notable omissions. Most of the gang is on deck but they're so ineffective. They rehash the same differences they had in their other movies showing little or no growth or development aside from the superficial 'romantic' themes. I get that Pepper and Tony are an item. We knew this already. I get that Black Widow and Bruce are an item. We knew this two movies ago. Same with Gamora and Peter, Scarlett Witch and Vision. and on and on and on. This is supposed to make their loss more poignant but it doesn't. The fight sequence in Wakanda and on Thanos home planet were so predictable. Such a waste of excellent CGI and actors.The only surprise in the movie is who survives. Thor, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers survive. I know this is to set up the next part of the Infinity War set that is scheduled to hit theaters later this year. The Russo boys need to step up their game. This disappointment does not bode well for the new film. Guys. sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Just FYI. You just know that someone is going to get hold of the time stone and turn back time so we can blah, blah, blah. Been there, done that. I really wanted to love this movie. I really, really did. But I left the theater feeling used and not in a good way. I felt like Marvel turned up the manipulation meter to eleven. Because, you know it's eleven which is one more than ten, right?I rated the movie a '4' because I wanted it to be good. It just wasn't.","2/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","gcarpiceci","2 May 2018","Sometimes when you cook a dish for your guests, you think that you'll make it more tasteful if you keep adding ingredients over ingredients; so, you have made this nice pizza, you have put your tomato sauce, your mozzarella cheese, maybe some ham, then you think why not some mushrooms, and well peppers will be just perfect on top it, and don't forget olives and cappers, hey we have some sausage in the fridge just slam it on top of it....etc. Most likely your guests will spend the night wrestling with your heavy-loaded pizza, trying to digest it.
Well, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars.
Note that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc...
So I'll go now, I have some work to do tonight to try and digest this nuclear pizza....","1/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheSeaLion","1 May 2018","While all of the heroes from across the Marvel cinematic universe united in a joint effort to stop Thanos, so too did all of the problems you can think of unite in a joint effort to bring down ""Infinity War.""It should be noted that I am not the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the most part, I find the movies to be passable while there are a few I have really liked, such as ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and some I have despised, such as ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers."" ""Infinity War"" could have fallen anywhere on the spectrum for me, and unfortunately, it fell at the way-down low side as the second worst movie in the entire franchise.The opening scene of the movie is the perfect setup for what is wrong with ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attacking an Asgardian ship with all of the main characters from ""Thor: Ragnarok"" on it. Thanos has killed everyone aboard, except for the few characters necessary to help keep the plot moving. Heimdall (Idris Elba) is left wounded so that he can be killed off by Thanos on screen after using his powers to send Hulk (Bruce Banner) to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers. It is supposed to be an emotional death scene, but the laziness of the writing and the showcasing of character stupidity for the purpose of plot progression is all too evident. Why didn't Thanos just kill Heimdall during the attack on the ship like he did with everyone else on board? It's simple: the plot would not be able to continue if he had done that.Character stupidity is at an all time high in ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" and it is not just restricted to Thanos. There is a lack of communication between characters for no reason other than for the movie to happen, and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) goes so far as to screw everything up in what is easily the worst written scene in the entire movie.The stupidity of the characters can all be attributed to an awfully written script. So much of the dialogue in the movie is the Marvel quips, but a lot of it comes in the form of characters throwing personal jabs at one another to the point of wondering why these heroes can't set aside their differences and not be annoying for even five minutes in order to stop a villain who wants to wipe out half of the universe's population.Yep, that's right. Thanos' goal is to wipe out half of the population of the entire universe. One complaint that people have had with Marvel is how safe their characters all feel. So, Thanos killing off half the population would seem like it was putting their characters in danger, right? Wrong. All of the characters who are killed by Thanos are the characters who had already overstayed their welcome in the franchise or do not feel permanent because, let's be honest, they are needed for future installments to the Marvel universe. It is ironic that the movie that seemingly takes the most risks is the movie that played things the safest.Even if these deaths did feel like a risk, it would not really matter. With so many characters to focus on, the movie has almost no time for character arcs (which is fine) and instead must show its characters through their speech and actions. However, so many of these characters act so annoying or stupid that you are just wishing for them to be killed off, and then the characters who are killed at the end by Thanos destroying half the population lacks any emotional weight because after nearly three hours of unbearable characters and dialogue, it is just a relief that the movie is almost over.The two things that ""Infinity War"" did well was not making the story feel jumbled and clustered with all of the characters, and they did do a good job with the characters of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany), but that is it. When it comes to everything else, the movie falls prey to a term film critic Roger Ebert used, which is 'idiot plot.'Idiot plot means that the only way for the plot to happen is for the characters to act like idiots, which I already went into a little bit to explain how even the smartest of characters have to act like morons in this movie for the plot to progress, but the entire plot of the movie is an idiot plot as well. Thanos' plan to wipe out half of the population only makes sense to the point of his backstory. In execution, it is a plan that falls apart and becomes dumber the more you think about it. This might be, though, because the movie tries to paint Thanos and his plan off as having depth to it, but this sort of plan would only make sense and work for a generic super hero villain who just wants to destroy the world because he is evil. So, with a villain with faux-depth and an evil plan that would only work for a generic super villain character, the overall plot of the movie is a dumb villain scheme that has awful juxtaposition to it.""Infinity War,"" to put it simply, is just awful. Nothing more, nothing less. And for a movie this big that had a decade of hype and buildup and planning, that is just sad.","6/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","imaxxing","3 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. 
That being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. 
Infinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.
 
So, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.Great CGI.No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.Too many characters.The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. 
For the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.It bordered on a comedy.For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. 
While some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.Geared towards a younger audience. As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents. It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. 
Most of us have outgrown the cliches. Poor ending.Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling. A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film.Overall 6.4/10","8/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","AGood","4 May 2018","This film was literally 2 and a half hours of non stop roller coaster action. This may sound like the perfect movie. But just think of this for a moment.The film was literally;Villian comes on the scene, whichever avengers is around flies or runs at them. Gets bounced back. Flies again, gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back.Then an escape happens, as the villian always gets what he come for as even his minions are way too powerful for every single avenger in the film. Cue literally 2mins of wisecracking and jokes. Next scene cuts eslewhere, villian comes on the scene, avenger flies or runs at them, gets bounced back, then 2 more mins of wisecracking and jokes..... for 2 and a half hours.The diaglogue is minimal in the extreme. Possibly only 200 or so words get said in total throughout the whole 2 and a half hour movie. Almost all of it is just filler wisecracking jokes.Watching this movie honestly felt like watching someone else play a video game, with the 2min cut scenes kept in.I don't know if I am getting old, or if it was just this film but I did not enjoy this. I loved black panther that I seen a month ago. But also hated Justice Leage so am not sure. I get the feeling kids will love this and think it the most epic thing they have ever seen. But parents will be bored. A movie needs to be more than just this.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","mitrapourmand","14 May 2018","We all know that these movies are blockbusters , we know that we should not expect much , when someone sits through one of these he /she should not expect citizen Kane , or the seventh seal , these movies are almost always mindless action scenes and big bangs and boom ( throw in a few punch line and some lame one liners and voila you have have your self an action movie ) but , at the same time these movies must be compared with other movies of the same genre , even the same universe to see pros and cons and for this i like to review it based on two of my favorite MCU movies. Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings .","2/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","dcortner-19918","10 January 2024","The best Marvel movie to date IMO. Fantastic all-around. The pacing was spot on, and I was very concerned about it going in. I thought I'd be feeling bored or dragging around the 2hr mark. But when Thanos reached Wakanda, I knew things were ending soon and I actually remember thinking I didn't want it to end.The cast were all stellar in their roles. Love Cap's new look. Really enjoyed seeing RDJ back on-screen as Iron Man as well. Tom Holland really surprised me with how emotional that Spider-Man death scene was. The ""I don't want to go"" got to me.I thought we'd get some exposition or the Avengers reuniting in some capacity first, but I'm glad we opened with a Thanos attack. It helped establish the pace and set the tone. The movie kept that tone throughout. Thanos is a badass, but I also really enjoyed seeing his backstory and character. In his own twisted way, he definitely did care for Garmora. The relief on his face at the end was a really strong moment. He completed his goal, in his eyes he's done the universe a great justice and now he can just relax.I do hope that at least Loki & Gamora stay dead. I understand those that vanished are going to come back but I think bringing those 2 back would be a bit extreme.I thought for sure Tony Stark or Steve Rodgers were going to bite the bullet in this one. But it just makes me that much more intrigued to see where things go from here.Also, I have to shoutout the score. The music in this film was incredible. I'm not familiar with Alan Silvestri but he did an amazing job. The score enhanced every single scene, and helped immerse me into this world. Fantastic work.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","fcabanski","20 October 2018","The writing was on the wall with an early fight between Thanos and Hulk. OK, Thanos is all powerful, but he beats Hulk with a few punches and knees. At least make the fight big.The writing got worse when the Guardians of the SJW Galaxy took the screen - cardboard characters wisecracking their way through vacant scenes.In fact, that's most of the movie. Most of the men act like 12 year old boys, arguing at the drop of a hat. That's supposed to be Stark's gimmick, but most of the heroes (males) act that way. There's no difference between Stark, Peter Parker or even Dr. Strange or even his Buddhist buddy.Most of the dialogue is banter. Mostly the so called actors pose their way through scenes. The fight scenes are so CGI and camera movement heavy that it's impossible to tell what's happening.The movie made a lot of money - a lot of people love the Emperor's new suit.","9/10"

The level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.This movie is not perfect. Jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and Peter Quills occurence with Thanos at Titan is not well thought out.

"Avengers: Infinity War","SnoopyStyle","11 May 2018","The Avengers face their most powerful opponent yet in Thanos. Thanos is collecting the six Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet to execute his evil plan. The heroes of the MCU struggle to stop him.It is amazing that this works as well as it does. This could be best described as The Empire Strikes Back portion of the MCU so far. The heroes get their butts kicked from one end of the universe to the other. It ends with a mass disintegration which is honestly even sadder and much darker than TESB. TESB ends bittersweet but this is just dark. Although anybody with a brain would see that the snap will be reversed in some way. There are many deaths that cannot happen which does diminishes the shock value of the ending. They can't kill off Spider-Man because the MCU doesn't even own him. Sony would never let it happen. They also can't kill off Black Panther due to his future movie and more importantly, his new popularity. Obviously, some characters will not make it but I think the vast majority will rise from the dead. The constant death reversals in the MCU saps away the shock value and that's probably this movie's main drawback. If they picked different characters to disintegrate, I might have doubts about reversing it.The advantage of the MCU is that these characters are so familiar that none of them needs introduction. In fact, this one starts from the end of Thor: Ragnarok and is no worst off by it. The relationships are well established. It's great fun to have them run into other heroes they've never met. Thor joining the Guardians generates a whole lot of hilarity. Drax is especially funny. Quill's insecurities is fun. There is an interesting pairing of Stark and Dr. Strange with Spider-Man as a fun sidekick. Relationships continue to be the strength of this franchise. The heroes are so well defined that the movie can spend its time with the villain. One of this franchise's weakness has always been the lackluster villains but Thanos is allowed to have his character development. His view points and his love for his daughter Gamora give him real depth. In many ways, this is Thanos' movie and it is more compelling due to the development.I do have some other minor issues. The giant Dinklage may be oddly cute at first but it's just odd. That section doesn't have the same action as Wakanda. Thor holding open the iris is not much of an action scene. I'd rather have that section finish quicker without flipping back and forth there. I would push that section back into the middle. The plan for Vision's stone seems like a low percentage play and his reasoning for sacrificing himself seems much more poetic. There has to be a way to do a ""needs of the many"" scene earlier and end in the same place anyways. Overall, this is well-constructed, well-conceived, and well-made. Despite the darkness, it still has its fun. The plot never stalls. The villains are great. The heroes are never in doubt. The franchise continues to be in good hands.","1/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","phoenixinvictus","6 August 2018","I can almost guess how the sequel is going to go... they are going to use some ridiculous time travel trick to undo all of Thanos damage. This two and a half hour movie was nothing more than a ten minute cameo for each actor to fight some alien.
The HUGE plot hole in this movie is Thanos ""plan"" and Ant-Man's mysterious absence in this movie. Let's see how absurd the plot hole of this movie is... Thanos' master plan is to wipe out half the population of the Universe because according to him there aren't enough resources for us all. Have you seen the size of the Universe??? The resources are almost endless! The Universe is a BIG place people! How can anyone not point that out to him? With his magic gauntlet complete he can just ""magic"" all the resources he wants with the snap of his fingers. Duh! But that is not all... Ant-Man possesses the technology to END WORLD HUNGER!!! All he needs to do is supersize ""a steak"" to the size of a ""truck"" and presto you can feed an entire city for weeks. Right there is the weapon to end Thanos' dumb logic.
Almost right in the beginning of the movie Thanos kills off the Asgardians on the ship, except for the main characters because... well just because we'll dump logic out of window and not bother the audience. Thanos then kills Loki-for REAL this time. Let me please have a moment to laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA! Even if Loki is really dead this time I cannot feel anything but amusement at this ridiculous death for he has died so many times that I have lost count! Why should I feel sorry for a guy who wanted humans to worship him as a living god? Wasn't this the guy who literally placed his father in an old folks home to rot away? Wasn't he the one responsible for starting a war of genocide? Wasn't he the one who was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people and caused the near destruction of New York City? Wasn't he the one who caused the invasion of New York City by aliens?
Let's face facts! Nearly every Marvel character has died and been brought back to life that it actually is getting boring!
Heimdall who is wounded uses the last of his powers to transport Hulk\Bruce Banner to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers instead of-I don't know- beaming the tesseract away from Thanos. How about sending it to the edge of the Universe? It's not like he has a locating beacon to find these things.
Gamora wants to stay away from Thanos because she knows something that he wants and makes Star Lord promise her he will kill her (yeah right). Gamora then does the very thing she said she wouldn't do and runs directly to Thanos to engages him in battle where we all know that she will lose.
Aliens attack New York again. What an unlucky city. Doctor Strange is abducted and Wong doesn't seem to care that his friend is in danger and returns home... Really Wong, I'm so disappointed with you! Why doesn't he open up a portal to rescue his BFF? I know that Doctor Strange wouldn't have abandoned him... of course there is the fact that Wong's ten minutes were up and the studio couldn't afford him. Okay Wong I forgive you. Doctor Strange doesn't use his magic gem to turn back time and ""bargain"" with Thanos. Why doesn't he do it? With the help of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spiderman and Star Lord they hatch up a ""plan"" to remove the magic gauntlet off Thanos rather than just cut off the guy's arm off! Star Lord being the screw up that he is screws up the entire plan. Doctor Strange simply gives up the time gem because it's the only way to prolong this agonizing movie for another hour! Why didn't I just stop watching this movie?
Captain America who is a fugitive is suddenly pardoned because he is just so darn good looking and awesome in his costume. Vision says that he won't trade a life for a life but there were so many lives lost during the battle to remove the stone from his head. Wakanda is invaded and the Hulk refuses to come out of the closet... So why was he saved and not someone else? Does anyone care? Why didn't Wong and his friends appear in the final battle and lock the evil alien army into the ""mirror dimension""? I'm just saying... Everyone dies and we all know that they aren't going to stay that way. These movies get worse and worse each year.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","robert-85923","11 May 2018","I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular.However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly. At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before.

"Avengers: Infinity War","antialias11","13 May 2018","*** Warning, mild spoilers ahead *** Ok, what sticks out about this movie? Nothing much. 
The acting is lackluster. No character has a character arc - understandable because none of them are given any significant screen time. The whole movie is basically one endless 3-hour brawl (with some battle scenes blatantly ripped from Star Wars/Lord of the Rings). Some of the brawls are so over-the top that they are ludicrous (even by comicbook standards). Example: When you break a moon into pieces and hurl all of them at someone on the planet below within one second then the impacting pieces should not just make a puff of dust when they land. The motivation of the villain makes no sense (after achieving his goal the universe will just be back to the earlier situation soon enough). Given that it's hard to emote with a villain in the first place having a full CGI villain makes it even less likely. Some of Gamoras mood swings in the matter where we're supposed to emote with him or her make even less sense.Speaking of CGI: It's on a level we've come to expect with some weird exceptions. E.g. in one instance we see Bruce Banner's head in the open cockpit of the Hulkbuster armor while he's standing around in the background - and it looks like someone just copied it in with MS-Paint. Seriously. Not even Photoshop quality but MS-Paint.The humor is relegated to one-liners and most don't land. The serious one-liners are predictable and pithy. 
The music score is effective if somewhat over-the-top pathos-heavy (but that's not unusual for US films, so it' one of those things we've come to expect to have to endure)The overwhelming feeling is that this movie was ""designed by comittee"". The boardroom idea seems to have been: ""Take the things that people enjoyed in other movies and make them non-stop"". 
Problem is: It doesn't work that way. Gems in movies are that because they are rare. Taking the time to lead up to them makes the payoff all that sweeter.After coming back I rewatched the first Avengers movie just to see if my memory deceived me. But no: It is a way, way, WAY superior film in every respect.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Jared_Andrews","5 May 2018","Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection. There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges. Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all. I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts. Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does.The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve.So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea. For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless.Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected. The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians. The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. 
Spiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony ""Mr. Stark"" and Tony calls Peter ""kid."" There's a certain father-son/mentor-prot√©g√© sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever.Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music.Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints.1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him ""Vizz"" is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention.
2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it.
3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie.Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did.

"Avengers: Infinity War","gavinp9","25 April 2018","SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much. The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista). The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Leofwine_draca","29 December 2019","So, here we have it: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the Marvel climax to a string of approximately twenty prior movies and considered by many to be the crowning achievement of the genre thus far. And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!","3/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","MxS7HGS","28 January 2024","Infinity War is a favorite among superhero fans. It tells the story of how the Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, confront Thanos, an Eternal, who is determined to gather all six infinity stones and wipe out half of the universe's population. The fate of the universe rests on their shoulders.It begins with a high stakes opening sequence on a ship, where Thanos and his children are introduced with well-written dialogue and a powerful score by Alan Silvestri. The Hulk's confrontation with Thanos showcases the sheer might of the Eternal, establishing him as a formidable adversary for the Avengers.Despite a large cast of characters, it balances them well without feeling overstuffed. It tells a compelling story in two and a half hours, maintaining consistently fast pacing. It features notable performances from actors like Josh Brolin, who plays Thanos with great intensity and Robert Downey Jr., who delivers some of the best-acted emotion in the entire MCU, adding depth to his character.However, some parts of the movie are criticized for feeling contrived or lacking in visual appeal. For example, the moment when Starlord punches Thanos feels forced, and the CGI and aging effects on certain suits are questionable.Despite these flaws, Infinity War is a monumental achievement in the MCU's early phases and stands as a convincing assertion that these films are indeed a form of cinema.","5/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","realmuthaf","6 May 2018","Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good.The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway.There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone ""for balance"" with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah.Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around.I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable. This, however, just continues the downward trend of movies like Guardians 2 and Thor 3.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Shadowboy_25cm","23 November 2021","""Avengers: Infinity War"" culminates the 10 years build-up of the MCU to this first part finale:The villain is very powerful, complex and interesting to watch, although his final art design is not that impressive as other impressive versions of Thanos.There is a lot of super-hero drama, a lot of apocalyptic atmosphere, a lot of smart subplots and impressive locations, there is a lot of surprise.The movie is very watchable and constructed somehow around best-of-scenes, very fast-paced, jumping from one important fight and conflict to another leaving behind some logic. The action and the SFX are impressive, I as a viewer have nearly none time to chill out,
it's a tour de force till the final battle. Very courageous by the makers to finish this movie as a Part 1-movie of a 2-part-finale (just like the new ""Dune"" movie by Denis Villeneuve in 2021).It's a good MCU movie (it's better than the second part ""Avengers: Endgame"") that relies on the former MCU movies to keep it as a fast-paced, gripping story till the end.Highly recommended.","8/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","maruugaa","18 May 2018","I'm not a fan of Marvel or DC or basically anything that Disney creates. Unfortunately, my friend wanted to see it and I figured:
1) There's a chance it could be good, considering there were other movies I thought were going to be bad, such as(Blockers, The Purge, Keanu, and even Wonder Woman) that turned out to be good, so I shouldn't pass this off right away just because it's Disney
2) I figured it couldn't be worse than Red Sparrow.Anyway, I was wrong to both of those. This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence.The only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade.The entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life.With the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class. Also, as someone who was forced to go to Catholic Church as a kid, if you've ever gone to the Good Friday or Palm Sunday mass where they all read that dialogue in monotonous voices that's so insufferable you're in pain? That's how I felt in this movie. I would've rather been a child at Good Friday mass again, because at least then there was prospect of a Cream Egg for sitting through that drawl.","9/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","PedanticEditor","2 June 2018","This movie is shockingly bad, especially compared with the other avengers films, and is the absolute worst Marvel movie ever made. Almost as bad as the Batman vs. Superman movie was for the DC universe. Fair warning, this review is all spoilers - not that it really matters since you shouldn't see the film anyway.I saw the film today and I can't help but conclude that the writers of this film were just lazy. For shame! I get that Infinity War is supposed to be the first part of a two-parter, so pretty much all the good guys had to die. But there are ways of making good guys lose without having them act like lobotomy patients throughout the whole story and literally die from stupidity every step of the way (oh, except for Spiderman who is inexplicably the only intelligent character in the story). In what ways were the good guys unbelievably dumb every step of the way, you ask? I'll tell you. And then I'll tell you what some better written alternatives could have been. This is just from memory, so there are probably more instances of bad writing that I've forgotten.1. Loki gives up a stone to save Thor, even though it may be possible to resurrect him later and Loki knows half the universe will die as an eventual result.2. Loki goes after the more-powerful-than-gods Thanos a moment later with a knife. An effing knife!3. The first thing Dr. Strange does is as Ironman for help. Whaa?4. Dr. Strange gets tangled up in weeds and faints, then to be carried off like a swooned and helpless fairytale maiden.5. Gamora attacks Thanos first, by herself, even though she knows she alone holds the key to a stone.6. Gamora gives up the final stone to relieve her sister from momentary torture, knowing that half of all life in the universe will die as a result.7. Wakanda opens its forcefield, and the super-duper powerful lady stops guarding the last stone in order to fight.8. Star Lord prevents the other good guys from removing the infinity stone holder from Thanos by deliberately saving Thanos from the mind control lady.9. Ironman didn't punch Star Lord's lights out when he saw that he was getting ready to do something moronic.10. Neither did Dr. Strange.11. Thor stabs the Thanos through the chest with a super-axe (which was obviously stupid in the first place, but even then he has time to pull it back out and chop off the baddy's head), and instead the baddy says ""You should have gone for the head"" and sucks himself into a portal to escape.12. Last, and least important but still annoying, the Hulk is effectively impotent for no good reason.Here are 3 Possible solutions off the top of my head that would have been less poorly written:1. Dr. Strange is distracted by something even more important for the entire movie, so that the other heroes can die tragically, and in the second movie he stops being too busy and just rolls back time and undoes Thanos' acquisition of the stones - also causing the heroes to not die.2. Same thing, except Dr. Strange or his compatriot could have opened up and closed one of their portal thingies to snip off Thanos' arm with the stones on it.3. Thor could have died trying to make the super-axe, or he could have cut off Thanos' head and someone else evil could quickly put on the stone-holding glove thing instead. Either way would have been an improvement.","3/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","rowpotdroid","29 April 2018","Suffering hype fatigue, over a year of industry talk about this movie in pre release. It takes away from viewing the movie. In the end it's just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age. The first avengers was original. But now what Hollywood movie makers due best, take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs. Sorry about raining on your Hollywood comic book Heroes block borer. But the only hero I can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels. They've become boring and predictable recycles. I spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie. Seems Hollywood is addicted to CGI for making movies that shouldn't be made. If they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up, no story, plot or actors acting just things blowing up.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","bob the moo","27 August 2018","I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.","2/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","bradykitchen-33648","15 March 2022","This film is phenomenal. I have no other way of putting it, they do a amazing job especially with how big this film is. The Russo brothers do a crazy good job with managing this huge cast. Every character is given some sort of purpose and their time to shine and it makes for through the roof entertainment but also a well written movie.This film has a really big advantage over other MCU films, all of the characters except for one have been developed. It allows the movie to focus far more on the plot and making a quality story and less so on showing who these characters are. This movie is very fast paced, which creates what is the most entertaining MCU film.The one character that was developed was Thanos played by Josh Brolin. He is the best MCU villain because he was developed. Almost all of the MCU films have one issue and that is the villain. Most MCU villains are not given enough development to be considered a good villain. Thanos is the polar opposite. This film does an amazing job of explaining his character and explaining his motive. There are a few times where you actually ponder whether he is right and that shows how well written Thanos is.The action in this film is insanely well managed. You get to see each character have their action moment and makes for a really entertaining watch. The comedy was also very good and I feel they managed it a lot better than other MCU instalments. I find a lot of MCU projects use comedy at inappropriate times whereas this film did not.In terms of gripes there were a lot of plot holes, which is hard to fault them on because of how much they already have to deal with but plot holes are there and they need to be mentioned.Overall this film is amazing. The Russos do an insane job with managing this giant cast while providing the best MCU villain to date.9.5/10.","10/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheNabOwnzz","2 August 2018","Since i am not a little boy that has an absurd kind of fondness for Marvel comics & thus its movies, i am able to judge them objectively without being prejudiced by a couple of adults flying around in capes. And with this knowledge, it is quite obvious that Infinity War is indeed objectively a terrible movie.As stated before i am admittedly not a Marvel fan, and i did not care to watch any of its predecessors before this one. It ofcourse should never be a requirement to watch about 18 films in order to comprehend this one better, but to be honest you really don't miss anything during Infinity War's simplistic narrative if you have missed all its previous films, except for maybe knowing the characters in it. But judging from what i have seen none of them are even slightly relatable even when having watched previous films. So even if you have watched previous films, a connection with these characters is impossible since they are so terrible written and often times poorly acted.First off, i cannot fathom enough how terrible the screenplay is. A couple of characters try to be funny and come up with lines of dialogue a 8 year old could have though of, such as: 'Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards' or 'Why is Gamora', or the discussion about Thor's new haircut. The plain stupidity in its dialogue and writing is basically an insult to the audience's intelligence, and thus it is a very dumb and low IQ motion picture due to this. The acting is mostly terrible, except by perhaps Josh Brolin ( Which is saying a lot, since he was a pure CGI character ). Especially Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt & Tom Holland all hand in absolutely atrocious and horrendous performances. All of them try to be funny and joke around in serious times, but it is never funny, instead its terrible pretentious attempt at creating wisecracks results in loads of cringeworthy scenes that will make the audience embarrassed to witness. Although in the three actors's defence, the abysmal script didn't help their performances either, and they are only partly to blame.The only interesting character in the film is Thanos, and while it does help a little bit that he has the most screen time of all characters by far, he still seems to be a victim of the clich√© fest that is Infinity War since his reasons for wanting to take over the world are hardly original ( Sacrifice the few to save the many kind of motivations, which we have all seen before ), and can probably be found in the 'Standard Hollywood villain rules guide book' anywhere. None of the 'Good guys' are relatable because their dialogue is so ridiculous and since the only intelligent person in the film seems to be Thanos, as everybody else seems to be lacking in self awareness and self consciousness on every level ( Especially all the times people who know what Thanos is capable of keep attacking him like they think they have a chance, what a joke that is ).There is once again a lot of sub par plastic cinematography with many artificial backdrops, especially in Wakanda. None of it seems particularly natural, and thus the film also has this visually artificial kind of feel that further decreases your immersion ( Although the characters already decreased this pretty far down with their terrible dialogue ). There is no depth or real sub text in the film except perhaps Thanos showing little Gomora his knife balancing which symbolizes his view of a world in balance, but that is pretty much all the cleverness in it. It also has a lot of melodramatic scenes ( Especially with Vision and that redhead woman whose name i forget ) between characters that you cannot relate with, and the only thing that i wanted to see happen was Thanos killing them all, as he was the only individual with even a slightly bit of depth or character, thus making only him, the villain, relatable. Ofcourse as is standard in modern films Infinity War is also very politically correct in that it uses a lot of women warriors fighting like men against eachother in order to negate gender differences like there are none, which further enhances the notion that this is ultimately an irrelevant film.Admittedly the only strength this film might have comes from Thanos's character, and everything else seems irrelevant due to terrible acting & writing. In the end, despite that a lot of characters meet their demise, it still feels as though nothing is really at stake because all the characters are frequently making unfunny jokes & dumb decisions, which in turn leads to the question: 'Why should we care?'","8/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","PedroReviews","30 January 2024","Avengers: Infinity War, the culmination of Marvel Studios' decade-long superhero saga, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that defies expectations and delivers an exhilarating and emotionally resonant experience. The film masterfully weaves together a multitude of storylines, bringing together an ensemble of beloved Marvel heroes to confront their most formidable foe yet: Thanos, the ruthless cosmic warlord seeking to restore balance to the universe by wiping out half of all living beings.At the heart of Avengers: Infinity War lies a complex and compelling narrative that explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the delicate balance of fate. The film challenges conventional superhero tropes, questioning the very nature of heroism and the cost of saving the world. Thanos, portrayed with chilling intensity by Josh Brolin, emerges as a formidable villain driven by a twisted sense of righteousness, adding a layer of moral ambiguity to the story.The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing the impressive power and skill of each Avenger. From the intense clash between the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos's Black Order on the planet Titan to the epic showdown in Wakanda, the film delivers a visually stunning and visceral spectacle that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, Avengers: Infinity War excels in its character development, giving each Avenger ample screen time to shine. We witness the growth and evolution of beloved characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, while also introducing new heroes who make their mark, including the brilliant Doctor Strange and the enigmatic Scarlet Witch.The film's emotional impact is profound, as we witness the bonds of friendship and camaraderie forged among the Avengers tested to their limits. The loss of beloved characters is handled with sensitivity and depth, adding a layer of tragedy and realism that makes the stakes feel incredibly high.Avengers: Infinity War's most defining moment, the one that will forever be etched in the minds of MCU fans, is the ending that leaves half of all life in the universe decimated. This shocking and heartbreaking twist serves as a devastating conclusion to the film, leaving the audience reeling with questions and anticipation for the future of the MCU.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","AlsExGal","26 August 2018","Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan? The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (""Stop Thanos""), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","radursm","3 May 2018","Not everything that glitters is gold! I'd say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars.
Returning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.
The last ""Avengers"" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.
Yes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine.But the ""Avengers"" franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back.
""Infinity War"" is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It's a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.
I quote a friend: What's the fool, the one who wrote the screenplay or the one who laughed at the jokes of the ""Guardians of Galaxy""?","1/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","Tessa11","9 May 2018","Unfortunately, computer-generated mayhem is much more important than character development. One-liners is not good writing. There was such hope with the Dr. Strange movie and nice writing....but this ""Avengers"" film does nothing to add to any of the previous characters' story lines...especially Dr. Strange. It's a jumble, with explosions/death/violence...with little use or reasoning behind it's constant grinding noise. All the tears shed by actors, had no heart behind it. It's sad when money drives a movie rather than writing. Just because something owns Lucas Industrial Light and Magic, doesn't mean it has to be on screen at all times. I thought SE was supposed to be light-seasoning...not complete coverage.The offering lacks in so many ways. Sad...had high hopes.","3/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","npfares","6 July 2018","I know a lot of you trolls out there are not going to like this review but whatever. 1. To big of a cast. Had too little screen time to be an effective character (all characters) and fit in the plotline effectively. 2. This ties in to not enough screen time, lack of emotional connection to the characters. I simply didn't care that half of the characters died by the end of the movie. Because we all know that most if not all characters are going to return anyway in future movies, it's a financial decision on Marvel's behalf. We all know that these characters are cash cows for Marvel studios so why care that they died when we all know they are going to come back anyway.... 3. Plotline, it had potential but due to time limits done by the studio and editing team it wasn't fully developed (Yes I understand half of you are going to say 'but I want my movie to be an hour and half and mindless fun'. and to rebut that, you can look this up here on imdb, 90%+ of movies that have made the most money and have the highest ratings are at least 2 and half hours long, most being over 3 hours so don't claim to represent the majority). 4. I would have liked this movie a lot more if they would have split it up into 2 movies, which would have been warranted with the material they were using in the movie. In the end, this movie was the 'might have been' movie. Too many 13 year olds went to see this movie who have never went to see movies before this.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","mt-95256","28 April 2018","TL;DRA phenomenal achievement - 10 years of films leading up to this has been worth itSimple story allowing so much to be packed inInfinity Stones are more than just dull McGuffinsA wildly different story and structure to most superhero filmsStructure more like a Game of Thrones episode - this works to its benefitThe ending is bold and brave - a real strength of the film as a wholeAll characters are fantastic - their interaction is the greatest joy of the movieNo one character hogs the film - everyone gets their fair share of screen-timeThanos is the greatest Marvel villain so farAbsolutely hilarious and very quotableSublime, varied and non-stop action that never feels like too muchSets up Avengers 4 very wellThe greatest Marvel film yet--------------------------------------------------------------Wow. Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a clich√©, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...","10/10"

My girlfriend, who normally likes any superhero movie that's action-packed, even though this movie stunk. Many boring scenes of talking....all about nonsense. Because when every single character can do absolutely anything....when every character has powers that are limitless....like for instance, let's go to outer-space, let's teleport, let's shoot a rope that curves 20 times and wraps around our opponent....when anyone can do anything....the result is total boredom after a short while.

"Avengers: Infinity War","SamALMan","9 May 2018","I am not a comic fan.. I never read printed materials on infinity war and now after watching this movie I feel if I have the chance to read it, I will.Anyway.. the movie started where one of the most recent Marvel studio movies ended, Thanos is on quest to collect all the infinity stones to proceed with his plan and while doing so he faces opposition attempts by the avengers and others.You will definitely feel shaken by the first scene in this movie and the shock won't wear out by that scene.. Thanos is determined to collect all the infinity stones even the one that is unknown whereabouts to Marvel movies fans to fulfill his aim.. the aim that made his quest to collect infinity stones understood and analyzed. It hold a real nice philosophical thought that really worth all the time to analyze. The visuals were amazing in this movie, specially for Thanos and the new characters. You can read emotions better on the main ""computer constructed"" character, they are very close to the emotions that you may be able to read from human real face. It is a fast based movie with few ""quiet"" scenes and short scenes with slight laughs here and there to lighten the mood. The characters who appear in this movie have varied screen time but it is noticeable even when some characters get longer screen time, they do not overshadow the efforts of other characters that have lesser screen time. The movie is definitely aiming to please group of audience that appreciate certain types of jokes and references. ********** SPOILER Begin**************
There were no introduction to Thano's snap.. by looking back at Thano's reasons to kill people, I never find it connected to the moment where he snapped his fingers.. he snapped as a impulse or reaction to an avenger attack.. his reasons where corrupted by emotions!.. but definitely showing that Thanos would do anything to have this power in his collection. 
********** SPOILER end**************Marvel studios started a huge project with multiple layers and stages that will make it impossible to wrap it as a perfect project.. you will definitely see slips here and there specially when the other Marvel studios productions seemed connected to this movie. At the end I would say that this movie is more suitable to young audience (to me 40 years and younger). Comics started as a ""relief"" and ended to be an ""art"".. This movie is one of the good examples of a nice modern comic movie.","9/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","brsmarc","23 May 2018","WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI went to see AIW in the hopes of washing away the taste of mediocrity of Black Panther. Having seen pretty much most the other Avengers franchise and predominantly liking them I thought BP was a deviation from the norm but, I now see with AIW's this might be the new normal.This color by numbers film is probably what the average fanboy would hope for: formulaic plot, a who's who of super characters, an odd and apparently solipsistic villain, a barrage of special effects, machines of destruction and a few melodramatic emotionless bonding moments.The entire two hours and twenty odd minutes ends up being nothing more than a long, boring commercial for the sequel (which will also likely dupe the same crowd of lemmings) into forking over $10, $15, $20? for a ticket. The ""deeper"" interpretations will probably dwell on the conflicted nature of Thanos and his complex subtextual commentary of the state of diminishing resources in their world (hint, they mean our world) and the Orwellian double speak where, when he and his henchmen/women go on their intergalactic killing sprees they pronounce (without irony) that they are not murdering, they are liberating. This is the language of dictators, despots and mass murderers (Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler). His insatiable goal to collect the infinity stones for his special glove/gauntlet will give him ultimate power. How serious is this villain about gaining ultimate power? Well he actually trades away his soul (technically its not his) for the ""soul infinity stone"". Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.In this rendition, our friends from prior Marvel movies seem to be not marvelous at all. This is the foundation for every 8 yr old boys ""fighting argument"" (eg: Who would win if Aquaman fought Spiderman? Or ""who's stronger Hulk, Superman or Batman?) fun and engaging sure, if you're an eight year old boy.But what makes this movie such a mess is exactly the notion of more is better. You could put all your favorite foods together on a plate and one look would make you say, ""Yuck, this is disgusting""But its the weight of expectations, need to generate huge box office, and this kind of ""ultimate hero fantasy"" that makes you feel like ""lets simplify"".","4/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","walentys","3 July 2019","The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for ""comedy"" is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a ""lighter"" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for ""comedy"" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film.Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing ""modern Marvel movies"" as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula.The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place?Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were ""just there"". No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into ""one united Avengers"" character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos.The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it.Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.","1/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","hotjanuary","13 May 2018","Infinity War is a good super hero movie. But I thought Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther were better.Marvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies.
1) if a battle between the Hulk and Thor in Ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat I'm pretty sure Hulk vs Thanos in a spaceship would last one punch.2) Star-lord is just a dude, he does not catch and hold Spider-man.3) If Tony Stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in Iron Man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in Waconda? I'm sure War Machine would have access to activate them.4) If Scarlet Witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near Wakonda why do 2 dudes in Scotland give her a hard time?5) Steve Rogers isn't invulnerable. When swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth he's apparently unharmed after Thor's hammer clears the baddies away. They had time to rip Steve up but didn't?Don't take the easy way out when writing the story. A lot of it was good but some of it was not. Writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief.
1) When an elaborate plan pins Thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he can't DESTROY THE UNIVERSE nobody would stop to talk to Thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe. At the very least you shut up and HELP REMOVE THE GAUNTLET so Thanos can't destroy the UNIVERSE!2) Gamora really thinks Thanos doesn't love her? All that time she was talking about Thanos not loving anyone made no sense. I kept thinking, Gamora, you're being really stupid, everybody knows what's going to happen... maybe you should try running or anything?3) When Thor arrives at Wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump/smash. Banner even feels he has time to stop, open his helmet to say ""You guys are so screwed now!"". But when all the heroes go to protect Vision from Thanos.... Thor arrives AFTER Thanos gets the last stone?I know I'm picking. It's because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and I'd rather not have anymore X-men The Last Stand or Fantastic Four (2015).","2/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","glofau","2 May 2018","A movie should stand on its own two feet as an entertainment experience. You shouldn't have to watch 18 other movies first in order to enjoy a film. Unfortunately, to enjoy Avengers: Infinity War, you really have to have seen all the other MCU films or this film doesn't really make any sense. Hell, they rarely even introduce characters by name, let alone give you any clue as to who these people are. It really takes shalllowness to a whole new level of yawn-inducing ennui.It's not like I haven't seen any other Marvel superhero movies; I've seen several. When I was a kid, I read the comic books. And I still had no clue who most of the characters in this movie were! And I certainly didn't give two hoots whether they lived or died.The film is a spectacular, eye-popping kaleidoscope of sumptuous costumes, special effects, and MONEY spent lavishly on just about everything. The salaries for the all-star cast alone must have sucked up a huge portion of the film's budget. But who cares? If you weren't already invested in the characters, you aren't going to become invested in this sea of nameless wisecrackers spewing rather clever (but pointless) dialogue endlessly.I couldn't make it to the end, I walked out about halfway through. I hear the end is the best part but I couldn't summon enough interest to care. They lost me with the meaningless major death early in the picture. Snore! I don't go to a film to see favorite characters bite the dust! Especially since they'll just have to resurrect people so they can make their various contracted sequels in their own franchises. This film is an expensive waste of time unless you're a rabid fan.It's all about the story, man! Without a good story and some time spent up front getting you invested in the main characters, a movie is nothing. Black Panther was terrific because it had a terrific script but this film sucked rocks because its script was a shallow, mediocre snooze despite the witty repartee.

However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","4/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","chukkacabra","20 January 2024","Thanos has to be the greatest villain in the MCU one of television's most widely known. His infamosity isn't just his power (Dormammu and Hela are more powerful) but that other than Kilmonger, he's the only other MCU antagonist with understandable motives that audiences can truly believe in.I understand MCU movies aren't realistic documentaries, but there is no way Thanos should have been the winner in the movie. Thor and Hulk may not have beaten him, but they should have done more damage. On Thanos' home planet, even though he had multiple infinity stones, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Star Lord, Drax, and Mantis should have taken Thanos down with their collective strengths.And the ending. Oh my. The most emotional, breathtaking cliffhanger in the history of television. So much so, that Endgame grossed over a billion dollars on opening weekend.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","ssatvaya-16480","19 June 2021","AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...
Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb .....,
Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".","10/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","joshkej-84077","30 April 2018","I'm not a huge fan of the superhero genre, but I'm able to appreciate these movies and have a good time when I watch them, however I can't say the same for Infinity War. Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic clich√© formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and clich√© There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","slightlymad22","29 December 2019","I just rewatched Avengers: Infinity WarThe nailed it. Against all the odds of juggling THAT MANY balls in the air, they pulled it off and it just gets better every time. It is imperfect, but it's still great.Josh Brolin is great as Thanos, he is a great villain!! Too many Marvel movies have weak villains. Not here. He is a great character, it is pretty much his movie. Continuing how great he was in Thor: Ragnarok, Chris Hemsworth steals the movie as Thor!! No mean feat in a movie with this many awesome characters. Robert Downey Jr is as awesome as always (when isn't he??) as is Tom Holland, he made me cry, it not going to lie. Mark Ruffallo has more to do than normal as Bruce Banner.Chris Evans and Benedict Cumberbatch are more supporting here as is Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany (even though I was crushed with there final scene) Sadly, Scarlett Johansson is wasted here!! She does not really have much to do.As usual in a Marvel movie, the action is great and it nails it's humour too!! One of Marvel's best for me.","10/10"

He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones. One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it.Really worth watching it , if u non Marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch , really enjoy it .

"Avengers: Infinity War","judemcrobbie","20 March 2021","I have basically nothing but praise for Avengers: Infinity War. Considering the rest of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are very safe and don't take many risks or deviate from their generic formula, this does. These movies will go down in cinema history, for better or for worse, and I do truly believe this deserves to be there.
There are plenty of reasons this is the best MCU instalment and one of the better movies of the decade:
The primary reason is the villain, Thanos. He played spectacularly by Josh Brolin, who even in motion capture gets all the acting through. The MCU has had such weak villains throughout so to see Thanos done so well is a great change. I think the genius behind how Thanos is the best villain is because the way the movie cleverly poses the question ""Could he be right?"". This gives him not only a sense of moral righteousness to us but we can truly see the ""No one thinks they're the villain"" philosophy making him so compelling. The opening scene of the movie shows the mad titan effortlessly slaughtering families in his quest to destroy half the population of the universe. He seems completely unfazed by this like he's done it before countless times. There is a clever line of exposition in this after this, not only backing it up that he has (That we will see a flash back showing he's been doing it for at least 20 years) but also how he got the first stone. I like this decision to say rather than show this as it puts us in the action of the people we actually have emotional resonance with, The Asgardians. Throughout this scene we see the two previously strongest characters, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), get not only beat down by Thanos but humiliated. This is especially prevalent in the hulk as we don't see the fight between Thor and Thanos. We do get to see the fight between The Hulk and Thanos however. This is one of the best set pieces in the franchise as not only is it bombastic action but also shows character for both of them, but especially Thanos. Through a mere few counterattacks, Thanos decimates The Hulk. This shows the brains he has, not fighting like the animal The Hulk does, and showing he also has the strength to go toe to toe with the previous strongest avenger. The genius behind the decision to show the brains is that t circles back to when in the final fight he says ""You're not the only one cursed with knowledge"". In this scene we also see the smarts of Thanos, outsmarting the God of Mischief-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He ultimately kills both Loki and Heimdall (Idris Elba), the final remaining people from Thor's previous life before the first Thor and the avengers. I think the next time we see Thanos on screen is in the Knowhere scene. In this he uses his grip over the weapons he has gathered, showing their abilities and his ability over them by cutting through The Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff) with ease and going as far as to turn our beloved Mantis and Drax into Spaghetti and just blocks respectively. There is a lot more in this scene which I could talk about, Peter's arrogance and the Guardians dysfunctional family ultimately leading to their downfall to the hand of a competent villain, but I will elect to talk on the emotional climax of the scene, Peter Quill attempting to kill the love of his life in order to save humanity but getting the rugged pulled out from underneath him. This leaves Peter in a complete state of disarray as if he had killed he would have felt immense guilt for killing the one true love of his life, and if he hadn't then he may have just doomed the universe. No win situations like these are perfect for developing character as we get to see them in difficult situations. This drives Peter and the rest of The Guardians the rest of the movie. There is two more Thanos scenes I would like to would like to talk about: the first of which is the Nebula torture scene. This is a truly perfect scene compared to the many others. Marvel has a tendency to crack jokes unnecessarily, which I'll get into later, but this is just completely devoid of all that humour which is just perfect. The fact Gamora says ""I always hated that chair"" and Thanos deciding to bring himself to the lower level, not feeling the need to assert his dominance over her sets up the next scene perfectly, and then the other thing in this scene is the decision for the 'Mad Titan' no to torture Gamora and instead torturing Nebula, again this makes the next scene perfectly. Then the final scene of the Thanos chat is the Vormir/Soul Stone scene. This scene is just chilling. When Red Skull (Ross Marquand) pronounces that you must give a soul you love for the soul stone, the reactions from both Thanos and Gamora are just amazing. Thanos goes completely silent, null and void he thinks over what he must do. The tear shed shows the pain perfectly set up in the previously alluded scene, but understanding he must do what he must do. In his eyes it means crossing the fate over the universe over his daughter and the only person he ever truly loved. Gamora in this scene is fantastic as well. She originally believes that Thanos doesn't love anyone and therefore he will fail, going as far as to taunt him about it. At the beginning the taunts come thick and fast but they slow down with her voice realising there's only one thing he loves. The climax of Gamora trying to kill herself instead of having to give the stone to Thanos is what makes the scene so great, giving the moral compass of The Guardians and she carries that to her grave ultimately.
Another reason for this being this being the best instalment in the franchise is because of the writing and acting for/from every character:
Iron Man is the man who started all this and Robert Downey Jr. gives a trademark performance. He brings the narcissism and arrogance that comes with the character. He also shows the swagger but more he brings arguably the fourth personality trait of Iron Man's tenure. This iteration brings the most human Iron Man. He has always had obsessions but in this the obsession is with having a child. This is started as far back as Captain America: Civil War (2016) with the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland). In this Spider-Man was easily the youngest superhero, he was still in high school, so Tony Stark saw him as a child, which later became his child of sorts. This is emanated as the same you want to push your child but not to the point of harm, Tony brings Peter Parker into the fight to expand the help for Team Iron Man or whatever it's called, but at the first sign of real danger he tells him to leave. This is carried over to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) where we see Iron Man as the mentor, Uncle Ben figure of the MCU. To those who don't understand that, Uncle Ben in Spider-Man is the man who teaches Peter humility and ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Tony Stark has this trait in this as he teaches Peter not to thrill-seek and do it for the greater cause, what Tony Stark had to learn 9 years prior in the first instalment of the MCU, Iron Man (2008). I say all of this because he gets annoyed at Peter for getting on the spaceship as he is fully aware that it could be a one way trip. The line Peter says ""I can't be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man if there's no neighbourhood"" encapsulates the lessons taught to him in the previous instalments of his character in other MCU movies. Then to see Peter die in his arms has to be the killing blow, comparable to losing a child. Not only does Tony feel this, but because of all the time spent developing their relationship in other movies and this one, we the audience also feel this like the dagger Tony Stark has just been stabbed with, both physically and emotionally. The back and forth between Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Iron Man is brilliant, it evokes the feeling when two of the worlds greatest but heads, like Messi and Ronaldo or Lebron and Curry. The ""I speak for myself"" from Doctor Strange is completely unnecessary and he just affirms Tony Stark's point but it shows however on the same tea, they are very much at each other's throats. This is even more apparent when in the spaceship Tony and Peter save Doctor Strange by blowing a hole and releasing the vacuum. Doctor Strange doesn't thank the pair but proceeds to make an indirect threat to them, saying he will not hesitate to not save them in aid to keep the Time stone. Also another 'alpha' character in Peter Quill joins them on Titan. This throws another problem as he has no willingness to listen to anyone but himself.
Thor is clearly fighting out of vengeance towards Thanos. Though not all by the hand of Thanos, in the last 3 features of Thor he has lost his father-Odin (Anthony Hopkins), his mother-Frigga (Rene Russo), his brother-Loki, and his four of his best friends in Heimdall and the warriors three (Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano). This man has seen everyone die around him so the guilt he must feel is through the roof. This is said by Mantis when trying to empathise with him. He is very much motivated in this by vengeance, it is because of this he is so powerful as he has ""Nothing left to lose"". This gives Thor the reckless abandon needle to take on Thanos alone or take the weight of a star to form his weapon. The will to take the weight, heat and energy of a star shows how much he was connected to Mjolnir. In very much way the the Tardis feels like a person in Doctor Who (1963-Present), Mjolnir had a sense around it that it was more than just a weapon, not just how Thor and it interacted but it's perfect timing and the noise it makes feeling like a language. Speaking of people Thor has lost, Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was destroyed early by Hela (Cate Blanchett). There isn't enough words doc for me to get it all in","4/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","daendil","6 May 2018","Warning: spoilers.There is not much one anticipates from a superhero movie. Spectacle (with lots of CGI), iconic characters, some basic story arc, and saving the world in the end.
Infinity War didn't deliver. And I hate to utter that. I hate to command movies to stay within they genre... But if they don't, there must be reason. There must be good reason. The makers stripped this movie of the most important superhero-flick-features and what remains, just falls apart.First of all, there are way too many characters (could this have been the reason behind the ""end result""?). And then the story arc: it's a downward spiral. The heroes try to stop the villain(s) at multiple locations only to fail one time after another, letting the villain march through with his plan and collect each and every one of the stones. And finally the world is not saved. The end. Cast. Oh, wow. Thank you.Now for the spectacle: that was ok - though most of the fight scenes were too shaky and chaotic for me. I would have preferred less and more detailed scenes, but I don't complain. It a little bit felt like a Japanese anime though, where one combatant pulls a big ass weapon only to have their opponent pull an even bigger ass weapon, and on and on, until one time an entire moon (!) was dropped onto our heroes...For the positives: we did have some good laughs, and the main villain is well detailed (for a superhero movie). Also, Peter Dinklage!Lastly I hate to be blackmailed to watch next episode like this. So no, I will not watch the next one, at least not in the movie theater.","6/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","BA_Harrison","28 April 2018","A mean, ugly purple dude scours the universe for the pretty gems that fit into his snazzy metal gauntlet, intent on using the power of the stones for his own nefarious needs. It is up to a team of brave superheroes to try and stop him.I've fallen way behind on my MCU, and am probably not the best person to comment on this latest instalment; or maybe, just maybe, my objectivity makes me more suited than most avid fanboys.For the best part of two hours I was reasonably entertained by what unfolded, despite not knowing the backstory to several of the characters. The plot was pretty easy to pick up, the action scenes were visually impressive, and there was never a lull in pace. It was slick, big-budget popcorn fodder designed to appeal to the masses, but which hardly qualified as revolutionary or indeed, all that memorable. Eventually, I could feel tedium creeping in. And then the last act changed everything...The final√©, in which half the population of the entire universe ceases to exist, makes Avengers: Infinity War a movie that lingers in the mind long after it has ended. Spiderman, gone. Dr. Strange, gone. Black Panther, gone. Groot, gone. And many more besides. Well-established characters vanish in the blink of an eye, and I have to admit feeling a lump in my throat at their casual dismissal. It's a bold move, for sure, and one that will guarantee discussion from all that stay the distance (which reminds me, be sure to remain seated for the now obligatory after credits scene).6/10 for the first two hours or so, but that ending... I'll be generous and add a couple of extra points for Marvel having the balls to go ahead with it.***EDIT*** Having pondered the fate of so many superheroes, I now expect Marvel to bring most of them back to life in the next film via Dr. Strange's powers of time manipulation-not such a ballsy move after all. My rating might be reduced to 7/10 if this is the case.***","10/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","plasticanimalz","15 July 2018","I wasn't going to bother with a review but then I read the first review by blparker that said everyone giving this a bad score were trolls who didn't see the film, then went on to praise it like it was Citizen Kane. I found that rather humorous. My suggestion is to see this in the theatre as the VFX are the only thing it has going for it and won't translate on the small screen. I had no idea this was a 2 hr and 40 min film until I bought the ticket and I seriously contemplated walking into another film because I just did not expect much from this film. When the film started it poorly leapt straight into a scene as if we were in the middle of the movie rather than the beginning. It didn't make a lot of sense other than a set up for on of the long-standing characters to die. Once we moved past this terrible scene it got a little better, which kept me in my seat 'cause the first 10 mins of the film made me want to leave the movie as I was afraid the rest of the film would be like this. It doesn't get much better but at the very least it manages to be entertaining.There is a plot, though, there is very little to it. If you know anything of the Infinity comic, which also was not that great, you know that a lot of characters die. The difference is they killed characters in the comic I cared about and the movies they don't even bother to have those characters, so, whatever. Secret Wars was a much better comic and tells how Spider-Man got his black suit, but it had actual story, so, I guess they didn't want to use a better comic. Infinity truly is one big dude fight. But not even that exciting of action. I thought the Black Panther action was better. I'd read that a bunch of guys don't like Rey from Star Wars because she's a Mary Sue, which I learned means a woman with ultimate, unstoppable powers. Funny, I've never heard a name for guys but they bothered to come up with one for women. Basically, every dude in this film is a Mary Sue. If Thor has the power to resist a star how is it he can't get out of a couple steel girders a wizard wraps around him? How is Captain America always so invincible? He was always kind of a lame character but now he's all-powerful in this universe. Why is Spider-Man suddenly Iron Man? What is the point of Vision, for someone so powerful he doesn't seem to do much other than whine.I did think Dr. Strange was cooler than his own movie in this film. Tony Stark, always likable. Thor was very enjoyable, and I loved his scenes with the Star Jammers. Peter Parker's humor was funny and I liked him better in this film than Homecoming. The best scenes for me were the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Pretty much everything they do is good. The best comedic line was from the bald Black Panther woman, which, unfortunately they didn't show that much of her. In fact, this was a 2 hr 40 min movie with only 2-3 minutes of screen time for the few female characters they've bothered to add to the film Marvel Universe, who are mostly only in the films to make the guys not look gay. The Scarlett Witch seemed to be one of the most powerful characters yet her few scenes were only dedicated to talking about how much she loves Vision and fawning all over this boring robot guy who doesn't seem to have emotion. Yep, a real attractor for women. Black Widow has been lame from the start. A Shield Agent with no powers whom they've given laser guns to, on the team with a bunch of super powered dudes and a god. Lame. There's a long assortment of Marvel super power females they could have added to Avengers but they literally just added someone to look hot. It really annoyed me how underused all the female characters were in this film. Black Panther's sister was the star of the Black Panther film and she has no purpose in the Avenger film other than to cut out Vision's stone. She's basically an extra.I've never kept much up on Thanos 'cause he's a relatively boring character who wasn't very often used in the Marvel universe for the 10 years I read Marvel comics. I think he was more of a Silver Surfer or Rom villain...which, did anyone actually read those? I thought the idea that balance is used as bad and evil was a bad message. What is he now, an eco-terrorist? He didn't seem so much crazy as a Green Peace dude with too much power. Thanos chose people at random so he wasn't a racist, a bigot, or anything else, he was by the films portrayal an environmentalist. Humans thin out animals when they ravage the terrain. How is it different? I go to films to be entertained, not have these poorly plotted out existentialism by stoners moments. In the past 6 months, Infinity War, Jurassic World, and The Last Jedi all had these nihilist themes or moments where they are trying to express some weak, childish form of morality but it is actually anti-heoric, selfish, immoral, or just lame.I, in some way applaud the writers for making the film mildly entertaining despite the amount of characters they were working with. That is a challenge. But, overall there wasn't much story going on or actual emotion so I really didn't care when they killed off a good chunk of the heroes. All I could think was, ""Oh, his contract is up, so they're killing him off. They didn't use her anyway, so, of course she's dead. Oh, well, he's a new actor every 2 or 3 movies, so, no surprise."" Didn't care. The entire film was fairly unmemorable and my life could have continued just fine without seeing it.","9/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","jtindahouse","2 May 2018","There are some films that simply can not be reviewed without going into spoilers. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' is one of them, so fair warning. I watch roughly 150 films each year and yet this is the first MCU movie I have seen. Not a single one of them up until now appealed to me. What finally got me along to see this one? Well the fact that it is currently sitting in the top 10 of the IMDb Top 250 had a little to do with it. I had to see what all the fuss was about. There are some truly tremendous and groundbreaking films in that list and the top 10 in particular holds some of the greatest films ever made. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' has no business being there.There are a lot of characters in this movie to keep up with and it is frankly exhausting at times. Admittedly, the film actually does a pretty god job of balancing everyone and giving them sufficient screen time and a purpose for being in the movie. There are so many characters though and so many story arcs that it can become a little frustrating waiting for the good ones to role around again. What I've learnt is that there are some incredibly strong characters in this universe ('Iron Man' was the stand-out for me) and some phenomenally weak characters too ('Captain America' probably being the weakest from what I could ascertain). The strongest thing the movie has going for it is the character of 'Thanos'. A genuinely intimidating, menacing and threatening villain is always the key to any superhero movie being good. Josh Brolin plays him brilliantly (as he always does) and this film owes a lot to that character alone.Now let's get into those spoilers by talking about the ending. Basically 'Thanos' wins and with the click of his fingers kills half the universe. We then see roughly half of the superheroes crumble into nothing and ""die"" (supposedly). I suspect this has a lot to do with the film having such a high IMDb rating. It turns out people love an ending where the bad guys win. That makes me happy, because it doesn't happen anywhere near enough in Hollywood today. My problem with the ending though is this. If you really think those characters are dead, never to be seen again, then you are sorely mistaken. So in that sense it is incredibly cheap. I hate movies (universes) where a character dying doesn't actually mean they're dead (DC is just as guilty of this sadly). As if this isn't obvious enough to 90% of people, the film actually reminds of you of this fact not 5 minutes prior when a character is killed only for 'Thanus' to go back a few moments in time and thus bring him back to life.Enjoy this film for what it is. It's a great looking flick, with some excellent action sequences, funny one-liners and a menacing villain with a clear and simple plot that is easy to follow. It's done well no one could deny that, but don't try and claim that is something truly great and worthy of the IMDb top 10 because that is simply not the case.","8/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","yaszi-83296","10 November 2021","This is the movie! A decade of build up for this, and it was really good! The movie is just 2. Hours and 30. Minutes of pure action, people that were fans, were not fans or think they are fans watched this movie around the whole world, their are groups of characters that fight for the same thing and as the movie goes on, more and more characters group together until there is only pretty much 1 big group of heroes. This movie is unique because the heroes aren't the protagonist, it's kinda the amazing villain Thanos, he is emotionally driven and his story is great, he is kinda a hero, he thinks wiping out half the universe is necessary to safe the universe from problems caused by overpopulation, he knows it is crazy and solving a problem means trying not to hurt anyone but he believes he has to do it! He is constantly getting hammered by the heroes and you kinda feel bad for him, there is no villain. This is why he is a great villain, he is not trying to be a menace out to blow the world, he is trying to do his part and save it.Another thing I love is that anyone can watch it, anyone can enjoy it even do they don't care about marvel, the MCU works in a way that someone only has to watch some movies to understand that there is a connection with these stones, and someone going after all of them is a big deal! The movie is it's own think and is pure fun superhero action, it is great and truly has a infinite amount of fun.The movie is a must watch and is the big event in a way, it is kinda the first part and the second being Avengers Endgame, both movies are their one story at the same time as being a part of this now over a decade long franchise. This is basically perfect and even do it might not be for everyone, this is just amazing!","2/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","nogodnomasters","5 May 2018","This is an easy film to spoil, so I will keep it brief. Thanos (Josh Brolin) gathers a group of bad guys with the quest of obtaining all the infinity stones. His goal is to save the universe by killing off half of its life with the snap of a finger...and enjoy the sunset. The film combines all the Marvel characters available to do a film to fight the villains and Stan Lee to play a bus driver. The feature assumes you have seen all the other films as there is zero introduction of character, and hopes you have forgotten a few minor details that conflict with the current film. The film is generally darker than previous films, but still has the humor. I wished Star Lord had discovered a new tape whereby he could defeat Thanos. Not thrilled with the plot or ending. The production works with 3 subplots for much of the feature. The ending...well we know what happens next with a go back in time and let's hose this series up like they did X-Men.","9/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","bunsen2019","2 May 2018","SPOILER: The plot follows Thanos around on his quest to collect 5 stones, achieve control of all dimensions and eliminate half of humanity in an attempt to save planets from population induced ecosystem destruction/annihilation. Each stone quest involves 10 minutes or so of the same CGI fighting. Why 5 stones? Why not, they've got time to fill. Lots and lots of time. Many of the characters are likeable esp the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Hulk and Tony Stark BUT, there are just too many groups involved with too much repetition. The plot is mildly interesting daring to touch on overpopulation crisis. Thanos makes a good point. Though in true Hollywood style, he goes about it the wrong way. He should have sterilized half the planet, not dissolve them.","8/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Top_Dawg_Critic","30 April 2018","A film that exhilarates and cheats you at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes. Sure, non-stop action with all your favorite heroes and foes, yet an overly fast paced plot leaves only the outstanding SFX to remember when you feel cheated by the ending, and knowing you have to wait another year to close-out the mystery. So until then, you have to jump to your own conclusions. Not a fan of these type of plots. Still, exciting and well directed and acted. A generous 9/10 from me.","5/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","l-r-patrick","2 May 2018","Firstly, special effects were really good, cast was also very good! I grew up reading these comics and Thanos along with Doctor Doom were my two favorite bad guys!
Thanos is very good in this film, it's just the writers obviously don't know the comics very, or just think they are better than the likes of Stan Lee and Jim Starlin who
was the person that created Thanos. Thanos kills to please Lady Death, he does not kill just because he thinks there's to many people, what a stupid idea that was.
I mean if he is worried about there not being enough resources for the population, once he has the infinity gauntlet, he can solve that by creating enough resources for
everyone! It would have been so simple to have Thanos worshipping Lady Death, her just silently watching, and him, as in the comics trying to gain her attention by 
killing to please her, but that was to complicated for the writers to put in, as audiences would not know who she was, lol. Self explained by Thanos, easily done, 
we've not seen the dwarf before, but he magically appeared, I mean, that was another waste of a whole sequence, Thor trying to get a hammer made (Beta Ray Bills 
hammer btw), I mean WTF, just have his proper hammer rejuvinate and hold the power, oh yeah, these writers wanted to change that part of the story as well.
These writers need to know, Stan, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko etc etc wrote and created these characters and they should stick to the original elements that made them
what they are today. They think they can come along and rewrite these stories in their vision, just like JJ Abrahams with Star Wars and Star Trek, they think they are
better than the original creators which they are not by any means!For me it's getting to the point where I don't really care if I see these films anymore, they just let me down every time, where these writers don't do the proper research
and just create it in their own way. The comic fans made the comics a success, without us over the years, there would be no films, so maybe you should try to please the
fans before the random cinema goers?Bits that really annoy me, no Lady Death or any celestial power beings of any kind, Red skull appears on the planet galaxies away to Thanos about the sould gem, great writing
there, true to the comics, NOT! Boy that sucked, I thought, why is this not at least Mephisto here or Lady Death, Red Skull, it's so bad I want to cry.
The Hulk was not really in the film, just the first few minutes, they just wanted to give the actor face time, so just had him jumping around in the Hulk buster outfit, yawn!This film is an insult to The Infinity Gauntlet Comics, go and read Thanos Quest, then The Infinity Gauntlet 1-6 and wait for this on normal TV.Totally ruined one of my favorite story lines, these writers need to get over themselves and not write it as if they think it's their creation, it's not!Best bit in the film for me, was Stan Lee's cameo!5/10 but should have been an easy 10.","6/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","MAYESY-44","1 September 2020","Absolutely brilliant from the MCU once you put everything together. It was initially painful having to wait a year after the end of infinity war but the film was brilliant. All the characters and different elements to the film. I could go on and on but 10/10 says enough.","3/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","milleniumlogan","3 May 2018","This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans. The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. 
Star-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy. Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot. Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene. Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense. Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie. Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth. Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU.","3/10"

The ending is particularly offensive, because it violates the prime rule of narrative-- providing the viewer with a sense of closure. At the end (almost) everybody dies and then. . .The End.

But these never-ending franchise add-ons are pretty boring unless you're 12 or a CGI junkie. There's very little evidence of a story behind all of the mind-boggling action, over acted drama, and special effects.

"Avengers: Infinity War","searchingfortao","27 April 2018","I've watched every MCU movie at least twice. I love them all, even Iron Man 2, but this was terribly disappointing. This whole thing gave me the impression that the writers watched a lot of Game of Thrones and thought: ""I know what people like, let's kill a bunch of heroes!"" Even if the fight scenes devolved to the absurd, it didn't matter, we had good guys dying, so this would be a win.Now obviously it's a comic book movie, so it's a safe bet that most if not all of the heros they killed will somehow miraculously be resurrected, but that's not the point. I just paid ¬£12 to watch characters I fell in love with get murdered for 2 hours only to have it wrap up with half of everyone dying. Now I get to wait an entire year to find out how they're going to fix it.If I wanted to get punched in the stomach, I'm sure I could find someone to do it for less than ¬£12 and 2 hours of my time.","4/10"

If you'd done your job, there could have been legitimate reasons for failure, not just you writing ""even though their lives are at stake and they are seconds away from getting off Thanos's glove, let's have Chris's Pratt say 'No! I will not hold on one second and beat on him after you get the glove off, I will do it now!' because darn it, it's too tough to expect us to come up with a good reason they fail."" How about having some of Thanos's followers show up and prevent it? There are so many other problems with the last third, I swear it was written completely separate from the rest.

"Avengers: Infinity War","tfminfl","13 January 2019","303. Avengers: Infinity War. Heres what I get... There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Droid army Vs the Naboo... only now it was Thermos' computer viruses Vs Wakanda... you're sayin that wasn't intentional? Filmbufftim on FB.","8/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","TheMovieDoctorful","14 November 2018","No matter what people think about me or my opinions, I wanted to like this film more than anyone. I love superheroes, I love Marvel and as much as I criticize the MCU for being safe and formulaic, there are several Marvel Cinematic Universe films that I've loved (The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the first 2 Captain America movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther to name the big ones). And I love that this movie enthralled and captivated many of my friends, a good number of them calling this one of their favorite movies of all time. However, the truth of the matter is that Avengers: Infinity War disappointed me. It deeply let me down. It's not an absolute failure and I certainly wouldn't call it irredeemable, but I can't say I find it to be a good film either.In terms of positives, the first one to come to mind would obviously be the jolly, purple giant himself, Thanos. He's undoubtedly one of the most interesting and developed villains in the MCU to date and he's acted phenomenally by Josh Brolin. I commend the creative team for keeping Thanos utterly despicable and villainous while still making him a compelling enough lead for us to be invested in his dark mirror of the Hero's Journey. It's fascinating to see an arc like this, full of sacrifice, struggle and personal loss concluding in an ultimate triumph, be translated to a villain without losing any of the qualities that keep him monstrous. He is a fully rounded, fully realized, human character; just not one who's a good person.As someone who hated Tom Holland's Spider-Man in both Civil War and Homecoming, I actually liked his performance and characterization here. The high stakes consequences of the story allow Holland to go to emotional places he simply wasn't allowed to before and his relationship with Tony Stark carries much more emotional weight, relatability and humanity to it than either of his previous two films. Maybe there's hope for this Spider-Man after all.Most (Keyword; most) of the content regarding the Guardians of the Galaxy is done wonderfully. Dave Bautista's Drax and Pom Klementieff's Mantis act wonderfully off of all the Avengers they get to interact with and it's nice to see that MCU teamup movies have moved and matured beyond thinking that every teamup movie needs all the team members to hate each other and fight over nonsense for 2 acts. Chris Pratt's performance as Starlord is truly heartbreaking and I commend the team behind Infinity War to have the guts to painfully strip away everything this character ever loved. For all my problems with the film, Starlord's emotional breakdown at Thanos after learning of Gamora's death is actually a major highlight of the movie for me. It's a deeply human and relatable moment that Pratt acts with such intensity and power.I also found myself really invested in the love story of Vision and Wanda. Elizabeth Olsen and Kevin Bettany have beautiful chemistry and their calm, soft moments before the storm bring a real gentleness and quiet beauty to the film. Scarlet Witch being forced to kill the only man she ever loved to save half the universe was by far the most emotionally powered moment of the movie and it's such a shame these two got so little screentime.That's the biggest problem of the film for me. Characters getting little screentime. Infinity War is deeply overstuffed, it has characters by the dozens and no idea what to do with a good half of them. Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Black Panther, the Hulk; all of these characters (As well as the side characters they're associated with) could be completely removed from the film and nothing would change. And yet, I'm supposed to feel the epic weight of their massive battle with the army of Thanos despite their importance to the story being minimal at best and non-existent at worst?The ending felt cheap to me rather than dramatic and emotional. The only deaths to really affect me were Vision and Spider-Man. The rest (Minus Gamora, whose death is too awkwardly edited and weirdly toned down from a violence standpoint to affect me until Starlord's reaction, and Loki, who has been seemingly killed and brought back to life so many times that I hardly buy he's finally dead) die with little to no reaction from their friends and comrades when that's exactly what we needed. We don't get to see Rogers react to losing both of his closest friends or the rest of the Guardians all dying together. It's all such blatant sequel baiting, especially with many of the characters (Including Loki) already having future MCU films or TV shows announced. Gee, I guess they're all just going to center on piles of sand, huh? This kind of sequel baiting conclusion is hardly ""new"" or ""bold"" or ""inventive."" In fact, it's pretty much what the MCU already did with Captain America: Civil War.Speaking of, as much as people want to give Guardians Vol. 2 crap for not balancing the comedy and drama well, where were your criticisms here? Towards a movie that starts making pop culture reference jokes almost immediately after Gamora's death, hardly even giving us a moment of mourning or reflection? A movie that hardly ever gives us a moment for pause for Thor to mourn Loki? I'm sure there was ambition in here somewhere, but in the end, everything got overpowered by the Marvel formula and tone for me.No, Infinity War isn't terrible, but I simply think it bit off more than it could chew. However, everything is set up for Part II to blow me away. I'm still holding out hope for this stage of the MCU to end in a high note for me.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","hp-33729","6 August 2018","I'm not really a Marvel fan, but I did enjoy some of their movies and like some of their characters. Apparently this movie is a culmination of all the previous storylines in the Marvel universe, so this time they made sure to _really_ go over the top with it to please the fans. All your favorite characters are there doing their own thing to fight against the main villain in an end game that feels like it's 7 hours long. With so many characters and so many parallel storylines I found it hard to focus or care about anything and just tuned out, like when you're watching a very long battle in a Transformers movie that has no consequences whatsoever and the movie loses you and you start to ask yourself why you're not doing anything useful with your life instead of watching that nonsense.It's probably just me as I'm not really interested in this universe in general and the main villain is kind of disappointing in my opinion, but be warned, if you're not a die hard fan either, you will probably be bored to death just like me.","4/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","s3276169","30 July 2018","The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel. This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh. The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks ""all the same"". On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer. That said this film is what it is. I've seen it all before and I'd be hard pressed to want to see it all again. 5/10 from me.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","haydenluz","13 August 2020","Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!","9/10"

Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","bora_mustafa","28 April 2018","I was really excited to watch this third Avengers movie, being that they were going all in with both the Avengers and the Guardian characters but ultimately the movie is just one big mess of a movie. The movie is more of a Thanos story which is fine as we need to know as much about this Titan, however the rest just didn't measure up.I understand getting some 30 characters together in one movie was always going to be a stretch, but I really didn't enjoy the movie. I won't delve into the plot as many reviewers have done so, I will just say that some of the action sequences were pretty good especially from Iron Man and Dr Strange, but ultimately the ending really agitated me and yes, we all know there will be another movie soon to complete this story but it just felt like a setup movie.Not as epic as everyone is making it out to be. I still rather watch the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier and even Ragnarok over this any day.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","hello-181-893413","30 April 2018","Maybe I'm just getting massive franchise fatigue but I found the moving totally borIng. The story is linear, the stakes don't seem real by foreshadowIng the fact that they can change the past, and there's a LOT of backstory they fill in to get you up to speed on all 500 marvel super hero's from their various franchises that it's hard to feel emotionally engage. The power balance between characters strength and weaknesses seemed flawed. One character would be in peril from X weapon in one scene but then beat a more powerful weapon Y in another scene. Movies attain suspension of disbelief by setting and following rules. These rules seemed sloppily applied but all in all it wasn't as bad as Venom...","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","preppy-3","27 April 2018","The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy combine forces to battle Thanos (Josh Brolin). It seems he has a glove that needs five stones to give him power to control the galaxy. He has three on the and will do ANYTHING to get the last two.It's too long and has no ending but I still loved it! The CGI Is flawless, the action scenes are fast and furious and the story whizzes along. The movie does assume you've seen every Marvel comic book film to get the characters so be warned. The acting is great and the movie manages to juggle multiple characters and plots and still make sense. Can't wait for part 2! :)","5/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","FabledGentleman","25 April 2018","MAJOR SPOILERS!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!My headline is the easy way to describe this movie. It is grand, majestic and spectacular. Just like Thanos towering everyone else with his physique this movie also stands above everything else, at least most of it. Because wow, this movie is really something to behold. Marvel went all in with everything here, the cgi is phenomenal, the acting is great, the story is well told, the pacing is near perfect. I have seen this movie twice in IMAX 3D and once in 4DX now, and i have never seen a movie with better image quality than this one, never.Ever since the MCU started with Iron Man i have seen every film released, most of them are good, some are outright great, a few are mediocre and very few are bad. But for the most part it has been a hell of a ride, and I've eagerly been awaiting this movie for quite some time, we all knew that it would come down to this, but were you prepared for what would be the outcome? Not many were, though many of us knew several avengers and other major characters would die in this film, i did not expect it to be this many.This movie truly didn't waste any time getting down to business, as before ten minutes had passed, Heimdall and Loki are killed, and we see the Titan kick the crap out of Hulk, this set the tone for the entire movie right of the bat, and was IMO a smart move, now we knew for sure what a badass Thanos is, and this was before he got all the stones.What the Russo brothers have done here is to overdo themselves. Winter Soldier and Civil War are two of the best MCU movies to date, and you got to wonder how Marvel found these guys, and knew what they were capable of, because Infinity War just lifted the bar even higher. This movie is sort of Michael Bay's wet dream, this is what he wants to achieve, but never can because he has no idea how to tell a story or handle emotions. This movie is a 2 hour and 30 minute spectacle, which has action scene after action scene lined up, and it never feels too much, somehow they managed to balance it, and that is a feat not many directors can pull off.But also the music is masterfully composed, and fit every scene perfectly. And the costumes and props design are state of the art, everything looks and feels so right in this film, all the people involved has done an outstanding job.And i really have to give it to Josh Brolin. Thanos is easily the best villain i have seen in quite some time. He is a complex villain, that is so well portrayed i almost start rooting for him, and that is saying something come to think how many years i have grown to love the avengers and the guardians. This is also big thanks to the amazing cgi that just brings so much life into the character. I can understand his motivations, i can side with his thoughts, i both agree and i disagree at same time. Such a great character, easily the best MCU villain so far, and i had Loki as my favorite before him.At the end when Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Scarlett Witch, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Black Panther, Mantis, Bucky Barnes and many others are killed because he gets all the stones, i both felt a sense of pride for Thanos completing his mission, he truly is a determined badass. But at the same time i felt great sadness that so many of the characters that i loved, are dead.But MCU has killed characters before, which has been brought back to life, so i guess that will be the case here as well, as the next movie most likely will deal with time travel and fight Thanos in the future and the past. Dr.Strange gave up the time stone because of the 14.000.605 outcomes that he saw, only one lead to victory for the avengers, and giving up the stone was the beginning of the victory path. So even though this movie ended on a cliffhanger, it left enough hints that will be talked about for a whole year, and it will build the biggest hype in the history of cinema. So at the end of the day, this movie just delivers on so many levels, and it will make way for the rise of many new characters to enter the MCU, and finally take down Thanos and undo some of the damage he has done.It's quite amazing that this movie actually managed to live up to the hype, that should not even be possible when you think about it, but it did. The movie is absolutely amazing.I can't wait for Avengers 4.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","brunovanael","21 January 2019","Jurassic Park, The Sixth Sense, Alien, Harry Potter and The Hangover are great movies. Putting all characters, realities and styles of these movies into one would probably result in a hidious thing, and that's what's wrong with this Avenger movie. There's too much of everything. More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.","2/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","tommy5677","29 September 2018","That's what you enter the theater with. Especially when you're going to see a Marvel movie. In this case not a single one was met. By the middle of the movie I found myself asking, where is it going and when is it going to get there.Three quarters in I found myself realizing it needed to be over. Every scene became a drag because that's what they did. On and on, one after another, with no endpoint. It was like the writer had a vision and then went blind.A simple plot that was easy to follow but it never seemed to develop. And you would think that in 2 1/2 hours you might get to know your characters a little. There was so much constant action and CGI, there was little or no time for that.If you enjoy being on the edge of your seat the entire time, this movie will do it for you because the action is never ending. A shining example of overdone CGI, lots of violence, and not enough time to tell if anyone can actually act.All of this nonsense to be left in the end with an incredible sense of loss. When I go to a superhero movie I want the superhero to win. In this case, The Avengers are nothing but a bunch of losers. And then there was the End Credits. They were giving credit to employees of the studios, like the CEO of Disney. WTF! This went on ad nauseum just like the movie itself. Don't waste your time waiting for the scene at the end, you'd be better off leaving the theater before the credits start to roll. 
In my opinion, this movie is an abysmal failure. Don't waste your 13 bucks on such trash.","2/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","warren-87235","20 September 2018","Having missed this at the cinema, my other half and I finally got round to buying and watching it (in 3D). Wow... what a mess. I'm glad we didn't pay to see this at the cinema. I'm quite honestly amazed at how many good reviews it's been getting. It's disturbingly close to 'Last Jedi' level bad (but not quite... that would still take some work). There's no real plot to speak of, things just seem to happen 'because', any sense of logic or consistency goes out the window (And that's in comparison to most of the other Marvel movies, which are hardly that great in the logic stakes in the first place!), power levels constantly change to fit a particular scene, rather than match what has been established for characters previously, etc., etc..... To top it all off, after all the build up, Thanos turns out to be one of the least interesting Marvel villains, with face-palm-inducing 'woke' motivation. The only good thing I'll say, is that it manages what most Marvel movies usually manage: the character interaction and banter is fun for the most part, and amusing. Oh, and most of the effects are good (except for Banner pointlessly in the Hulk-buster).I understand and applaud the desire to try an 'Empire Strikes Back', but there are a few big differences (A story, for one). Empire works so well because our heroes get their posteriors kicked. They struggle tooth and nail to survive, and even when they do get a chance to fight they are soundly defeated. Infinity War falls flat, because the villain and his forces never feel particularly strong, and our heroes get repeated opportunities to defeat Thanos and simply don't take them because it would end the film early.To be honest, despite its very obvious flaws (and a certain top lip deserving second billing), I actually found Justice League more enjoyable. I genuinely began falling asleep at the end of Inifinity War and closed my eyes, just listening till the end, I was so bored. Such a shame and a wasted opportunity after the build up of so many movies.","10/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","mikocot","11 May 2018","I am not a comics specialist and unlike most of the others I have no emotional connection to any of the hereos... so I might be biased.I have never expected much of a story line or intrigue from a movie solely based on the heroes presence, but being recommended as a revolutionary and number one of the series I hoped for at least a bit of cheap humor and great pictures.Yet, in the movie I've laughed twice, first time when Thor called raccoon a rabbit, and second time... when he did it again. The ending is surprising, especially for an American movie, but besides this the movie neither offers scenography comparable with Star Wars or Avatar nor any unique special effects.There is no consistency in action, power distribution or whatsoever. One minute the same character can die from a fist hit, the other he survives an explosion of the whole planet. Once he travels the space barefoot, the other he dies from being sucked from the ship. The colorful light goes back and forth but the evil character doesnt use any of his powers most of the time just to prolong the boring fights.Watching this movie is just distubring and frustrating.","10/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","tyrantlizardthad","19 August 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film so powerful and good that instead of being crushed by the weight of its expectations, it lifted them up and launched them out into space. Packed with epic, intense action, fantastic character work, and a powerful ending, it doesn't get much better then this. It's especially remarkable when you remember just how much buildup there was to this film and how massive the expectations were, you would think it would be almost impossible to meet, but Infinity War does it so well it makes it look easy.The story is exhilarating, it moves at a brisk pace which really makes you feel the immense stakes and how urgent the situation is. Every single character is handled extremely well and are all in character. The film makes sure to pay attention to what spot they're in in their character journey since the last film each respective character was in and continues their development. It maintains continuity and brings every character together in a way that's organic and serves the story perfectly. Tony Stark finally gets to fight the thing he has been tormented by and preparing for years to fight, Steve Rogers and most of the other Avengers are fugitives of the law and thus are more rugged, Bruce Banner is still dealing with his conflict with the Hulk (continuing what was established Thor: Ragnarok), Thor is dealing with the grief of losing everything, manifesting in personal vengeance towards Thanos, and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the characterization of Thanos, one of the best villains in cinema since Darth Vader from Star Wars (which was the intent of the Russos, specifically saying that the wanted to make ""the next Darth Vader""). He is a ruthless, insane and narcissistic monster, but he still has honorable traits, respects his enemies, he has a very flawed perspective of how to save the universe but believes it whole-heartedly, and even a fatherly love towards Gamora. He's terrifying but also humanized, and it just works perfectly.The computer generated effects, especially those that brought Thanos to life, are perfect, as is the soundtrack. While MCU scores are typically regarded as forgettable, Alan Silvestri's score for Infinity War is anything but. The performances are impeccable as well, there's not a single unsatisfying or uneven performance. Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Benedict Bumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Zoe Salanda as Gamora in particular stick out to me and knock it out of the park.In conclusion, Infinity War is the best MCU film and one of the best films to have come out in the past 10 years, and I don't think you could ask for more. Infinity War (along with its sequel, Avengers: Endgame) isn't just a movie, it's an experience.","5/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","pal05052003","29 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War manages to fix and upgrade superhero movies on many levels. First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.","3/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","jeller94","31 January 2024","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a triumph that flawlessly juggles the weight of its monumental narrative with moments of uproarious humor, delivering an exhilarating rollercoaster that earns a solid 9/10.From the outset, the film grabs your attention with a boldness rarely seen in superhero cinema. The stakes are sky-high, with the formidable Thanos looming as a threat of cosmic proportions. The Russo brothers showcase their directorial prowess, skillfully managing the massive ensemble cast and multiple storylines to create a cohesive and engaging narrative.What sets ""Infinity War"" apart is its audacious decision to give equal weight to its villain, Thanos. Josh Brolin's nuanced performance injects the Mad Titan with a formidable presence, and the exploration of his motivations adds layers to the character beyond the typical antagonist tropes. This bold approach elevates the film, creating a genuine emotional investment in the fate of the universe.The movie's big spectacle moments are nothing short of awe-inspiring. The visual effects are a testament to the technological prowess of the MCU, delivering jaw-dropping sequences that make full use of the cinematic canvas. The action is relentless, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats as heroes from across the galaxy unite in a battle of cosmic proportions.Marvel Studios strikes a perfect balance between gravitas and hilarity, infusing the film with the trademark humor that has become a hallmark of the MCU. The banter between characters adds a welcome levity to the intense situations, showcasing the camaraderie and chemistry built over years of interconnected storytelling.The plot's boldness is evident in its willingness to subvert expectations and take risks. The film doesn't shy away from exploring darker themes, resulting in emotionally charged moments that resonate long after the credits roll. The conclusion is both shocking and satisfying, leaving audiences eagerly anticipating the next chapter.In summary, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" stands tall as a testament to the MCU's ability to deliver a cinematic event of unparalleled magnitude. This epic superhero ensemble is a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike, showcasing the unparalleled storytelling and blockbuster entertainment that has become synonymous with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","pink_floydilia","10 February 2019","So to preface this review, let me start by saying I'm a massive Marvel fan. I've lived, breathed, written and read Marvel since I was eight years old.
The Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie. And to the masses, it was good. So hats off to them for making a crowd pleasing movie. But to the others who like some sense and substance when they pay good money to see a movie, try harder.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Mr-Fusion","29 April 2018","High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, ""Infinity War"" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color. But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result. If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly. I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction. And that's about it.6/10","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","comolgab","12 January 2019","Superheros are super because they do amazing things compared to the rest of us in this world. Here however, everyone does amazing things, always, for too long. It becomes boring. There is no normal world in the background to provide the contrast, it is one (long) fantasy tale. They're all ""super"" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still ""clunky"" and ""solid"". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character. Of course the movie is visually striking, but again, from the first scene to the last: I got used to the visuals after about 20 minutes, the rest felt to me like repetition.","3/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","olgavalentovaov","30 April 2018","This movie has certainly made history. A film that has so much going on and still manages to be boring just has to be some sort of a record. I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there).
Also, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot.
And to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay. We don't need another character up in here, we really don't. And especially not Carl Manvers.
Not worth the cash, not worth the hype, not worth another word.","7/10"

Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some ""plot holes"" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers","1/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","bogdanrc","27 April 2018","Awesome visuals and CGI, but this is not 1990s. Terminator 2 was awesome back then. Now CGI just does not impress anymore. That's Michael Bay territory, and this movie sure looks like that - awesome CGI and dumb plot.Character and plot wise, I just want to say that I am sick of heroes and villains having their abilities appear or vanish from one scene to another just to justify the plot. Not to talk about stupid character decisions that completely change the plot...It takes away from the soul of the story which becomes simple, forced and artificial.SPOILER:Just one example for abilities (but the movie is full of it): in one scene Thanos beats the pulp out of Hulk, but in the rest of the movie all the other heroes receive punches from him like it's nothing.And one example of stupidity: Quill becomes responsible for the grim ending by saving Thanos in the last second, as Thanos was on the verge of being stripped of its powers.I expected more...","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","tzarr0","14 July 2018","Well ... the only movies i really enjoyed from this Marvel Universe ... are GotG 1,2 and Thor - Dark World and Ragnarok ... especially because are not Earth based, and explore other cultures and civilizations. This one butchered both ... storylines and character groups, with a really childish story follow-up and characters' motivations, an overpowered uni-dimensional antagonist with a relentless and simplistic goal (i guess this is specific to comic-books ... but i hoped the franchise had outgrown those ... and will try a little more depth), way too many action scenes with a known outcome ... no twist, no upset ... nothing to look remotely interesting and to remember about the plot.

"Avengers: Infinity War","oliverdimitri","26 April 2018","Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.","3/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","JayDeeezy","10 October 2021","This film knocked it out of the park and will go down in history. Seeing our heroes crossover was done very organically and led to a fun and thrilling path. The story was unpredictable, had an unexpected main character and the ending was perfect.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","nicar127","13 May 2018","Kill kill kill. Death. That's what this movie is about. To their credit, the actors in this film were all great, despite each being given minimal screen time, with near zero character development. There are just too many characters and angles, each with the same ultimatum: KILL. (They are all trying to kill the villain Thanos, of course, but it's still Kill Kill Kill!)I never felt any passion for any of them until Gamora was thrown to her death by her POS step dad Thanos. When we see movies we want to feel the passion of the characters we are watching. None existed until this moment. My favorite character in this film is Peter Quill. Way to go Chris Pratt. He brought depth and passion, sorrow and love, to his role. He is the stand out in this film. I cried when he cried. I was pissed off when he was pissed off. Peter Quill / Star Lord was the sole representative of human emotion in this film. And he did it well.On the technical note, Thanos just looks like a cartoon character.
(No offense, Josh Brolin, you were GREAT as Thanos!!)
CGI always looks fake. I watched the entire movie imagining the ""green screen"" behind all of them. In a few years, actors won't be needed at all.Iron Man could have just gotten a huge eraser to erase Thanos The Cartoon.

"Avengers: Infinity War","dezsokekovacs","28 April 2018","If you like to watch for 2.5 hours how your heroes get beaten and even killed then this movie is for you, otherwise it will not entertain you. 
At the beginning Thanos has only one Infinity Stone but at the end he has all the stones and therefore he snap his fingers, half of the population dies (Avengers included) and ... THE END!
This means that there are 5 fights for the 5 stones and Thanos wins all the fights by beating and/or killing the Avengers.All MCU movies structures are the same. They are split in 2 parts: in the first half the heroes get beaten and the villain wins all, but when all hope is gone it start the second half when the heroes recover from their wounds and they win (almost every time) with a big ""idiotic"" bam.
The Avengers: Infinity War is the first half. I think it will be entertaining to watch it when the Avengers 4 will come out (just like The fellowship of the ring + The two tower). It's very likely that in Avengers 4 they will use the time stone to reverse the time to resurrect the dead Avengers. Or maybe another stone (honestly I don't really know what they can do) but the resurrection is for sure.Bottom line: this movie is watchable if you see it only once. But to watch several times how your heroes get killed means that you need therapy.PS: When Dr. Strange looked into the future to find a positive solution, he found only ONE from millions of possibilities and they didn't used it. Why? Or they used it but Strange didn't saw in the future that Peter Quill is coming?","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","sergew","18 May 2018","I'm tired of the comic based movie genre which further signals the death of original scripts and content. Don't get me wrong, originality alone does not make a good story. This movie continues to try squeeze water from a rock and I leave wanting so much more. The movie was much too long and especially the fight scenes. As in the old Wendy's commercial, ""Where is the beef?"", or in my case a good story and characters I care about.","2/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","adeckofcards","25 July 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.
In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.
It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.
'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","1/10"

The plot is as simple, formulaic and stupid as it can get. There is a huge amount of holes, henny. The chemistry between actors (hence acting) is non-existent. All that we get - is a portion of idiotic choices just to excuse the upcoming ""ACTION"". Ye, baby, gimme more... These sweet fireworks and a talking piece of purple CGI is all I need.

"Avengers: Infinity War","ocr-94520","10 May 2018","It totally wasn't how i expected it to be. It's just a silly film with only action. Many cringy dialogues and dumb moments ruined the film. I felt really bad when yondu died in GOTG 2 but in this film never felt anything for anyone. So many died but i don't know why this film was in a rush and that's why their death didn't made me feel bad for them. They should have increased the runtime of the film. One of the worst thing is characters were not balanced. Captain america hardly had any dialogue. Hulk was shown only for 30 seconds in the entire film. There were many ways to stop thanos but hey he should look badass so let's make heroes dumb. Cgi was okay but in many places it looked cartoon-ish. In one scene it looked like Mark ruffalo's face is pasted on hulk buster. The film is full of plot holes.","3/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Shakor77","18 July 2018","To a certain degree most super hero movies are pointless as they are mainly about beings with super powers and in flamboyant costumes duking it out at each other. And, seeing as I grew up reading super-hero comics, that is just fine.However, without getting into any spoilers, this movie could have ended the first minute as the end-result would have been the same as watching the whole thing for 2+ hours. So I guess you could say that this game was a setup for the next Avengers movie, which seems to have become the norm these days.But disregarding that, there are a number of other weak points in this movie such as:Hulk was a massive disappointment and made his weakest contribution so far of any Avengers movie. And it was never explained why.Vision was another disappointment as apparently the Black Widow, who has no super powers, could hold her own against someone who was mopping the floor with Vision.Some young girl in Wakanda, who I never heard of in the comics, is apparently more intelligent than both Bruce Banner and Tony Stark as she came up with a solution, in about 5 minutes after been presented with the problem, that those other two hyper-intelligent people could not come up with. I suppose that is because of feminism?Loki made a very uncharacteristic choice which quickly made him irrelevant in this movie. Why then even have him in the movie to begin with?Dr Strange, who was pretty good in the movie, didn't seem to stand much of a chance against a Thanos henchman but apparently could go toe to toe with Thanos himself?Thor was easily swept aside by Thanos, in the beginning, yet by the end seemed to be the only one who could actually defeat Thanos, just because he had a weapon. Yet in Thor: Ragnarok Odin suggested that Thor, was more powerful than Odin and did not need any weapons as he said: Are you Thor: son of Hammers? I could go on and on but this is basically a very nice action movie with some great performances from actors such as Josh Brolin as Thanos. But don't think too deeply about it as it is just an action movie and not much more.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","aj_gr8","2 May 2018","I mean I don't get it why this movie came in the top 250 movies in IMDb. I am not saying that this is a bad movie but the best super hero movie ever? People have just have just made up their minds that it's avengers so it must be a very good movie. The pervious avengers movie were better than this one. In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","three_dead_crows","5 May 2018","In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. 
 
The day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel. After watching this movie I feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure Peter Quill is, just like they did with Danny Rand in the defenders.","1/10"

So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","DaytonaBob","17 January 2019","The movie was mostly a lot of CGI and a lot more fighting. ALL neat to watch. BUT the idiocy of believing there are a handful of little stones that control the ENTIRE UNIVERSE? All the neat outer space scenes and strange alien landscapes all of that.BUT to say he would be able to control the ENTIRE Universe?I am sorry but that is beyond ridiculous.I am huge Marvel fan and can actually say I have been reading Marvel since FF#4. And at one time had almost every single issue of the comics they put out until the mid 70s. They were great fun.This movie on the other hand is silly. One person with a handful of stones controls the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.Do the writers at Marvel et al have any clue as to the size of the universe and that is just what we have been able to see? The bazillions and gazillions of GALAXIES, the number of planets would be a ONE followed by millions of zeros. The amount of beings, and all sorts of life forms would be a One followed by a number of zeros so large it is unfathomable.I would have bought say, the galaxy. But this stupidity of the entire universe was just that.Seriously lame. Silly and beyond any sense of rational thought. YES it is comics and just a movie but the primary belief in how to enjoy a movie is the SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Sorry, NO. And on top of that it all centered around a small planet in one of the arms of the Milky Way closer to the edge of the end of the arm than otherwise. Really? HOW did we get so lucky in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.We are supposed to believe the Thanos character would have the ability to wipe out half of that? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAI love Marvel but this should have been an insult to anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together. Oh well I hope we don't get a conclusion that reminds me of an old Saturday Morning serial of Jungle Jim where at the end of the episode where we had to come back next Saturday to that theater to find out how he got out of the predicament of being caught in a HOLE half way done and below him were lions ready to tear him apart and above him were natives ready to rip him apart and cook him.So how did he get out of it? Well Next Saturday's episode started with the voice over stating: ""After Jungle Jim got out of his last trap he headed towards the nearest village"" Seriously that is how they did it.So are we going to get either this was an alternate universe?
A dream that when one of them gets out of the shower his wife says I had the strangest dream?
Or .....? ""Thanos you bad boy, Where have you been? Your father and I have been looking all over dozens of universes. Now you put things right or you are going to get such a paddling when we get back to home!""Thanos: ""Aw gee mom you never let me have any fun""This will be the only interesting part is what silliness they use to restore the universe to its natural order minus some nutjob like Thanos.Gods above and below that was an awful movie but it was cool to see all the Superheroes in one movie.. So glad I could watch it at home and fast forward through all the fighting.BUT ya gotta hand it to the fanboys who have posted it was the greatest cinematic effort in the history of the world. And the one guy who said anyone who says differently then IMDB should immediately pull the review and probably publicly flog the person who wrote it.","8/10"

Even if you haven't seen the movie, you've likely heard of and know what film is being referenced when someone says, ""the snap.""Ensemble pieces really hinge on the chemistry between the cast, and everyone here played so well with each other's characters, it was a real treat to watch.

"Avengers: Infinity War","myema77","17 May 2018","Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates.
Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find?
You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered:
Slick action and stunning visuals.
The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here. Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond.With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie.
The story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing.
(The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner)
The supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe.
 On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn.
Thano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing! Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life.As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this. Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie?
Opinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie.Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme.2 stars, one for Tom Holland and the other for Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Lewis_Heather787","28 April 2018","What did I just watch???? To be honest I don't think I can process everything and I'm not such if that is a bad thing or a good thing. To get it out there straight away I'm not a die hard fan of these films actually if anything I've losing more and more interest in the MCU as its gone on. I'm not quite sure why, just a lot of them are not for me but I can see why general audience love them, they are vey appealing. Positives.The Russo brothers were given an almost impossible task and that was to bring together a huge amount of characters in one film and tell a cohesive story that works. For the most part I think they have achieved that, the directing of the film is faultless and is a real achievement considering the number of things that could go wrong with a film like this. Personally though I would put it behind ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"" for the Russo's , those films have less problems than this one.The cast for the most part is good, I cant mention them all because there are so many however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly and I'm really shocked to be saying this, the best character in the film for me is Doctor Strange. Now I personally didn't like the character in he is own film, but thats another story, in this film he is the heart and plays an important role. Acting from Cumberbatch is obviously going to be great, but I was blown away by how good he really was. There is a fantastic fight scene between him and Thanos on his own, wow. The other standout is Thor, Hemsworth again knocks it out of the park and has really cool scenes towards the end of the film which are worth the wait. The others are all really good as well for the most part, but those two definitely stood above the rest. NegativesThis is where this review gets a unhelpful mark because it goes against the consensus of this film. For me there are four main negatives film the film, ok bare with me. Firstly its the same old same old problem I personally have with the MCU and that is the dreaded humour. Extremely cringeworthy at times and once again far to much of it especially with the Guardians, which also really don't like. I know Im in the minority on this, and I have no problem in people thinking this is the best part of the film its just not for me. 
The humour of the film links to the next negative and that is the tone of the film, which to say the least is all over the place. One second we have cringeworthy jokes and the next second its all trying to be serious. I think the Russo's really struggled with this element of the film because the humour and jokes undermine the seriousness. Do one or the other??
The third negative is the end which is a complete joke right? The end was looking at first glance to be a fantastic emotional punch and shocking end to some characters. However instead they decide to ""kill"" off characters that we pretty much know for the most part will be back for the next Avengers film next year. Marvel have already announced sequels and other solo films for characters like Black Panther, Spiderman and maybe even Doctor Strange. So their deaths are meaningless and carry no weight, brings up the question what is the point in the whole film really when we know a reasonable amount of it is going to be reversed in the next film.(I could be wrong)
The final small negative is the length of the film which is far too long, the film does definitely drag in some parts.Overall the film is probably just about good enough for 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, when the film is good it is very enjoyable and good to watch however I have my reservations. They are mainly my own fault and I'm definitely in the minority when it comes to them. However I'm wondering whether even the most die hard fan is not a little disappointed with this film like hasn't this been 10 years in the making. Finally if you like these types of films you will absolutely love it however if your not to bothered like me then you might not enjoy it as much.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Vartiainen","21 June 2018","Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something.So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring.The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more.Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending... We will be talking about that ending for decades to come.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","CubsandCulture","12 December 2018","Everything about this movie was portrayed as bigger and more. Bigger Action! More heroes! The problem with that eventually more becomes less and the story collapses under its own weight. That happens here but not as much as I expected. The final film is coherent so there's that. It is also largely fun. There's that too. However, there is still too many sequence of the same stuff (get the stone!) and a lot of the film is very unwilling to play with the world it has set-up. Of note Dr. Strange and Thanos (post reality stone especially) are far too punchy. You can change the fabric of reality. Why do you insist on just punching people?A film like this lives, or this case disappoints on its villain. Thanos is OK as a villain. He is played well by Brolin. How he is written leaves much to be desired. His radical environmentalism simply doesn't connect with anything that is actually happening in the world today. It makes the film feel insular and escapist in the wrong way. Moreover, the logic of the character requires him to be either a eugenicist or a ""eat the rich"" radical; the screenplay does neither. The writers try to split the different by applying the big moment randomly. (but somehow random means 1/2 of each significant couple among the heroes). It simply doesn't work. It is not chilling. It is not human. It is silly.The deaths (""deaths"") are overdone. I simply do not believe Disney is going kill off a bunch of Golden Geese. It simply doesn't have any emotional weight because too many characters that have sequels in the works ""die."" The ending only gets a hearty chuckle from me.This film is fun. It moves and most of the action is good. But it is shallow, hollow and expects us to forget how capitalism works.","10/10"

Characters blowing up and running around at the same time. Is it possible I have become overstimulated by this type of adolescent entertainment?

"Avengers: Infinity War","geislekm","15 March 2020","For some reason, the Oscar voters will never vote for a CGI actor because ""it's computer generated'"". That's BS. The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is.
Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie.

"Avengers: Infinity War","jandrfilms","9 December 2021","Anything that has to do with the Avengers, Marvel comics in general, I'm there with bells and whistles on. Love these types of movies, like I said, I'm a comic book geek.The scenes were outstanding, Thanos fighting all of the Avengers and then some who wasn't Avengers joined in to beat this evil foe. I just hated in how it ended the death of Tony Stark (aka Iron Man). Now for me, I wasn't much of a Robert Downey Jr. Up until his role as Iron Man, loved the way he brought some intelligence to the role of Tony Stark as well as humor to. I just hated that they had to kill him off.Maybe Dr. Strange can go back to that moment and change the coarse of history and still keep the ending the same, by allowing Tony Stark to live but still killing off Thanos...hmm, interesting concept, HEY MARVEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?","8/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","10 June 2018","I know I'm extremely late to the party, but I waited for a time to sync up and see it with a friend (we both have too many obligations in the education realm), plus I had to see Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok beforehand.Now before I leave any impressions, know that my experience was dampened by students with a moronic goal of sabotage by deciding to blurt out anything about the film they knew that I wouldn't want to know. I mean... what can I do to them in retaliation? Fail them? Strike them down with the hammer of Thor? Nothing, they're untouchable and they know it. It's sad, and I thought I've taught them to be better than that. Unfortunately, that select few is out there and always will be. I've waited nearly thirty years of my life for a film of this impactful magnitude to come out in its respectful genre, and individuals half of my age decide to play the card of indecency upon me and essentially impede on the level of my viewing experience.All that being said... it was a very good film, even better than I liked it (the problem was the spoilers). In fact, if I were to list negatives for this film, it would really just be all in one lump-sum bullet point regarding the lack of grounded material: a lot of space related stuff, nanotechnology (and I really don't like the Iron Spider compared to regular ol' Spider-Man), whims of inexplicable magic sources, levels of seemingly unbeatable friends and foes where I don't understand the devastation of a punch or explosion onto the individual taking the blow, and the recurring MCU element of death not necessarily being a finality for characters' ends.Conversely, there were many things that I really appreciated about the film. The first thing I would like to mention was the balance of everything, starting with the balance of characters and their moments. I thought this was going to be a massive issue going into this film, where it would just be one endless action battle and people wouldn't be able to serve their parts correctly, or they would only serve aspects as a moment of convenience to further the plot. Instead, where everyone was at during any moment seemed very natural to the overall MCU progression of items, and interactions that were had (on top of some that have yet to occur, lying in wait for the fourth Avengers film) were nicely played out. Villain encounters even appeared late in the film, which is kind of nice so that the legend looms larger as the movie goes on instead of playing beats such as: ""We need three fights between hero and villain, so let's spread them out."" Even characters who are physically inferior weren't just suitably matched up with other characters of that nature, and instead they found a way to possibly hold their own or team up to make things equal enough so that the fights could be anywhere with anyone. None of this works just in script alone; this was done by the hands of great directing. The Russo Bros have found a way to serve this great kind of balance for two straight films, though in Civil War it really felt a little more like: ""Let's force the issue and get everyone on screen at once, even in a bit of a friendlier brawl."" Admittedly some characters miss the boat of even appearing in the film, but it was few and far between, and they are explained away where frankly it worked just fine.Another great form of balance was in the light versus dark emotional moments. I have been on Marvel for having too many lighthearted moments in their films, or really too much levity for the sake of entertaining the crowd on their first viewing of a film. They really pushed the envelope with Thor: Ragnarok, and honestly I was not appreciative of it. They needed to find a way to strike the right balance of when to say what and what surface level of comedy they need to inject during the characters given the moments, but most importantly every light moment needs to be balanced with a dark moment for emotions to hit the right heartstrings. Infinity War does exactly that. I wasn't eye-rolling when they injected humor, and only one or two comedic bits were out of place for the moment they were in. That is a fair price to pay for the overall structure. They had enough characters to find those moments with in the 160-minute running time, and for once they didn't have the villain(s) either be demoted to that same level of yuck-yucks nor did they subject them to another character's comedic relief as a way to actually victimize them.This is a great time to transition to this film's villain: Thanos. I have had my quips with MCU villains being rather underserved in scope compared to that of the larger picture at play, like where they may be more of a pawn so the rest of the chessboard could do its thing. Thanos, however, appears as the king of this universe's chessboard. He was the main character in this film, and probably had the most screen time. He was not just a villain seeking ultimate domination of everything for the sake of it, he has his own goals and purposes in an attempt to restore a harmonious balance (there is that world again) for all species. It was not only believable, but it was also sympathetic. He shows remorse for his (attempted) actions, he shows mercy to those who beg for it so long as they aid in furthering his cause, and he speaks with a level head in a way that if we haven't already had eighteen other MCU films liking our heroes so much that we would actually root for the bad guy here. Definitely the best served comic book villain in a decade, if not right alongside the Joker for 'overall' status. Granted, Heath Ledger has given us the performance of a lifetime, though that character is very one-dimensional (and really good at that dimension, no doubt). Thanos really surprised me that he was more than just a large purple alien wanting ""MOAR.""I want to give the directors credit for making an extremely long running time feel extremely short. I don't know if I'm sitting here saying that I'd like to watch a whole 'nother hour of the film, but they hit the right beats and paced it so evenly that they really made time fly by in a manner that other films really can't speak for in the same vein. For all the movies I own on Blu-ray, I sometimes stop short of watching something that runs this long because I tell myself: ""This is a long film man, you are going to be devoting a lot of time to this."" I don't think I'll be saying that about Infinity War. If I were to show this to a friend who hadn't seen it yet, I wouldn't be warning them about the duration of it nor would I fear they would be looking at their watch every fifteen minutes wondering when it would end. The more you get into the film, the more you lean forward on the edge of your seat. Yes, sometimes they do cut away from characters to get to others because they have to, but you never forget your place where others are at and you aren't dismayed at the next grouping's story line. It all worked so very, very well.I'll cap this off with one thing that wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be, and it was in the movie's action. There was nothing wrong with it, but outside of some last-act battles I wasn't ever really wowed by anything either. All visual effects were top-notch, though (ehem, Ragarok was not good here too). I do think I'm putting this on a relative scale though, because it's interesting that I say that looking back at the whole picture that I think the moments outside of the action were actually better than the action points themselves, not in terms of entertainment but just in overall value. That's a good thing too, so now you're not just sitting around waiting to be getting your money's worth again. This jumps back to how the film's length is not a concern. No action scene overstays its welcome either, or it has enough dynamic elements and cross-cutting that it fits properly (again, jumping back to Civil War, that airport scene was just way too contrived... this doesn't have that). Age of Ultron was much more of a popcorn flick for me that I really do enjoy, and The Avengers has all of its lasting appeal in the final third of the film when they all assemble together, so I think I can say this one is the most consistently put together.Overall, I would say that my experience was definitely a great one and it is likely hitting inside my Top 3 of all the MCU films (The Winter Soldier still wins). I'm not ready to officially rank it just yet and I still have a lot of questions about what I saw in this one, but again that's a good thing about this film's natural depth where I'll have to watch it more than once to understand and appreciate those items. I really think the thing that brings this movie down a notch was my experience because of spoilers beforehand, and I didn't want to believe many of them to be true but unfortunately many were. This is a movie that I even avoided watching trailers for. Any knowledge about an event I am already interested in does not help ramp up the hype by me learning more about it. Shame on them for doing that to my theatrical viewing, but thankfully this film did not only rely on its spoiler-bound moments to be as good as it was. It was very ambitious, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next because I really have no idea where they want to go from here.","9/10"

It also spent too much time focusing on the villain and his rationalizations for genocide.

"Avengers: Infinity War","viithtrump","26 May 2018","Marvel's biggest issue in my opinion is that there is just too much to take from comics, as it is a giant cluster mess. There is so many marvel characters now that some are just not that great and they shouldn't exist. Black panther is a yawn, and same with the second iron man (pure stupid, along with a 3rd in Banner? Are you kidding me right now?) and new younger spiderboy (even more dumb), which I feel shouldn't be in this series. Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful. I really think they are headed for clash with like Galactus and other bigger enemies and when Fox is bought out by Disney it will lead to the Xmen joining too, gets bigger and worse.

"Avengers: Infinity War","highmarksreviews","29 April 2018","""Avengers"": Infinity War"" is an epic unlike any other. It's a reminder of how far the MCU has come in 10 years and this movie capitalises on its bloated, but beloved cast to draw you in. Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.","1/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","Pjtaylor-96-138044","29 April 2018","'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","danjstanley","6 May 2018","I don't typically write reviews; however, someone needed to balance out the over the top love for this bad plotted film with way too many stars. For me, it all comes down to this question:
""Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?"" The answer is NO! 
I know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. 
Then, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.","4/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","AdrenalinDragon","26 April 2018","I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too.I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to 
focus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it. The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations.9.5/10","5/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","arthuradam","5 May 2018","If I am to get to the point, the movie was noisy audibly and visually. It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. 
There's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. 
Too much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other.
Wakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now.
Anyhow, there are some good parts in the movie, but it's rushed and just awful. I preferred Justice League as a movie; the pacing was a lot better.","5/10"

The story is very weak and there is zero character development. Maybe the characters were already fully developed over the previous 30+ movies and hence why so little attention given here.I'm just not invested in the series and so don't find the Avengers movies to be much of a pay off, but get why others do. Personally, I found it to be an exhausting, unrewarding experience.I still gave it 7/10 for its appeal to the fans, but possibly 5 or 6/10 for myself.Recommended for the fans, not anyone else","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Floated2","12 March 2019","Avengers: Infinity War has become a massive box office success and occasional worldwide phenomenon. Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous.Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man.

"Avengers: Infinity War","Film_star","27 April 2018","I have rated this 5 stars, predominantly because I think 9s and 10s should be provinces reserved for truly great movies. This is an entertaining one, which kept me interested for most of its overlong running time, but which won't leave me with much lingering sense of a tangible movie - it felt like a solid episode in a series I'm binge-watching, but I'll struggle to treasure many specifics of this movie from a line-up of Marvel titles.There are a ridiculous number of characters in this; the film is using that as its ""event"" selling point, but in truth it was the factor which made me most apprehensive before watching it. To the filmmakers' credit, the juggling of storylines and superheroes (and their endless sidekicks and sub-teams) was almost impressive - it never felt as though many were shoehorned too awkwardly into the forward trajectory of the overall narrative, though some characters - including leading players like Spider-Man and Black Widow - inevitably get shortchanged.The series' most rewatchable movies - for me Avengers, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Ragnarok and Black Panther - all have something compelling that feels unique to them. I'm not sure this has a unique selling point beyond a huge cast jostling for billing position on the poster, but whilst it plods along it's perfectly decent, and fans of the franchise will likely lap it up.At the time of writing, the film is ranked number 10 on the IMDb list of the Top 250 movies OF ALL TIME. I'm certain it will plummet once the general public start to supersede the fanboy rush, but this kind of kneejerk over-ranking in the context of cinematic history is a nonsense.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","austin0731","25 April 2018","Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody.Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment.Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable. But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.","1/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","namashi_1","29 April 2018","The sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 'Avengers: Infinity War', which assembles almost ALL of its Superheroes in one single film, is the biggest Marvel Blockbuster to date. Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story. 'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course!But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc.That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure!Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch! Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts.On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.","9/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","coreyjdenford","26 April 2018","This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free***** (5/5)IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock. Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron ""I'll do it myself"" and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin. How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage. Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them?Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait. VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.","1/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","frank_kneepkens","3 August 2018","Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that ""I don't understand"" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!","4/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","MiroslavKyuranov","25 April 2018","This is...I literally got no words after this movie.This is the most epic movie you'll ever seen. You will cry from pleasure, you will cry from epicness and you will definitely cry from heartbreaking scenes. Ten years of building, leading to this MASTERPIECE!I guess you want to know something about Thanos. Well, he is the ultimate villain, I mean he is menacing. Every speech that he got, gives you chills, his movements, his motivation, hands down the best villain!The interactions between the different fractions of heroes is magnificent. The first time you see Guardians and Thor, Iron Man and Guardians, Strange and Spidey it's just awesome! The chemistry between them is incredible.The story is told incredibly. The waiting for this movie, the hype, everything is worth it. Actions scenes especially some....are jaw dropping, you gonna shake your head and you will be not able to stay on your seat calm. The music combined with the scenes, like I said MASTERPIECE...this movie is out of this world.Russo Brothers just strike again! The visuals are so well done too. There is no way to catch every single detail on the first viewing, also the movie deserves multiple viewings again and again and again...and I'm not even joking.On purpose I do not want to give you absolute any spoilers. I want you to enjoy the movie by yourself. I believe any real fan will be happy with the result of ten years gradation and like me, will got no words.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","jhalcollege","3 June 2018","In linear algebra, a matrix is said to be rank deficient if one of its rows or columns can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows or columns. In layman's terms, this particular part adds nothing new to the overall picture, it just uses information that is already present.This happens to be the defining characteristic of Infinity War, there's nothing new here. What there is is a lot of action, a lot of CGI, and lots of bad jokes with a few okay ones tossed in the mix (exactly what Marvel has been doing for ten years).The film makes a half decent effort to distinguish arch-villian Thanos from the rest of the baddies, and its kind of succeeds on a minimal level. But in the end, he's just another world conquering fiend who's bigger and stronger than everyone else (Steppenwolf from Justice League?) who is set off to collect some arbitrary artifacts.Another issue is comes as a side effect of putting so many established characters in. Take Captain American for example, a character whose driven by morals, and whose films are relatively serious, and the Guardians of the Galaxy (about as serious as Looney Tunes). They've done fine on their own, but put them in the same scene and it just doesn't work. At this point, if you're not sick and tired of Avenger's Universe, then good for you. But for the rest of us, one thing's for sure, haters are definitely going to hate this one.(If you're not familiar with the IMDb rating formula, you should check it out. While Infinity War rests at an 8.8 at the time of this writing, it will drop reasonably over time as more casual viewers watch the film, and rate it the four or five it deserves.)","2/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","billking6666","29 September 2019","Disney really went all out on this and the sequel. Thanos was a character introduced AFTER my time reading marvel Comics. His character is what we in the gaming world would call OP (Over Powered). How does destroying 50% of all life in the universe bring balance? The whole blasted plot was based on that silly premise! I am pretty sure I need to blame some obscure writers at Marvel for this ridiculous plot and character. The entire movie makes a mockery of science and even science fiction. Spoiler: The idea that you could collect 6 stones (which were created during the Big bang) and then snap your fingers to wipe out 1/2 of all life EVERYWHERE in the known (and probably unknown as well) universe takes witchcraft, sorcery and the supernatural to levels beyond anything within reason. Now where do you go Disney? You gave us a worst case scenario and any future villains will be mild by comparison. As with Thor Ragnarok you destroyed a future where Marvel has skipped over many villians and leapfrogged to the top, leaving a barren wasteland for future enemies to ""marvel"" at.","1/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","Iykman","12 May 2018","This was crap to be honest. 
It had some good action but made no logical sense! A good movie must make good sense. First, Hulk is so toned down that Thanos didn't even employ any of the stones to beat him! In less than a minute he knocks Hulk out! ""We have a Hulk"" is so meaningless right now. Then Banner is forced into and kept in an iron man suit. Agrhhhh! Thanos is so hyped that he shouldn't be beaten even in part 5. How is it that Dr Strange never used the time stone? Then Iron Man and Spiderman (humans) are able to breathe freely on Titan?Also annoying, Vision is carried about like a baby, limp and powerless. You just wonder whether it's the same vision that was so powerful in Civil War and could walk through walls. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting the Avengers to win Thanos in this part since it's a 2-part movie but let's put it this way; the avengers were humiliated! Probably should have been called - Avengers: Thanos the powerful.Waste of 2+ hrs for me.","5/10"

"Avengers: Infinity War","classicsoncall","5 September 2018","Compared to the first two Avengers movies, I've rated this one a solid '9' against a pair of '7's' for the other two. The prequels felt more like getting the most out of all the destruction that the super-heroes could inflict on their cosmic adversaries. That formula's still at work here but it seemed a lot fresher with the team-up between The Guardians and The Avengers, while Thanos (Josh Brolin) brought a decidedly different dimension to his role as an intergalactic enforcer. Some might even call his mission honorable, in as much as he wants to save the universe with his philosophy that ""If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist"". Fresh on the heels of ""Thor:Ragnarok"", the Marvel and Disney folks do well here to keep the humor in place while dramatic events unfold throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth)/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) dynamic was especially played well, and it was a hoot to see Thor accept Rabbit's, er..., Rocket's (voiced by Bradley Cooper) claim as captain of the Guardians. Where the film loses a point for me has to do with the inconsistency with some of the principal characters. Depending on which prior movie you care to cite, Thor and Doctor Strange have been positioned as the most powerful entities in the Marvel universe. However here, they were dispatched rather handily in the early going by Thanos's minions. There's also the quite literal overkill that occurs near the end of the story with the disintegration of heroes like Black Panther, Doc Strange and Spidey, along with the entire Guardian team. You know they have to make a come back in the follow up sequel(s), so it seemed like an almost cheap attempt to elicit pathos from the audience. By my count, at least fourteen Marvel characters met their demise in the story if you include Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner in the after credits scene.Once again, and I can't help it, but kudos to Stan Lee, Marvel comic writer and originator of many of these characters, for his bus driver cameo near the beginning of the picture. His one line was particularly apropos: ""What's the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?""And oh yes, don't want to forget this little tidbit. There have been any number of movies with scenes set in New York City in which the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are in prominent view prior to the events of 9/11, but in this flick, there's a quick glimpse offered of the new One World Trade Center rising from the city skyline. I thought that was very cool, and even better that it wasn't in the path of the New York City dust up.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","skam_platform","4 September 2021","I love this film, it has the correct balance of all the ingredients. For the people saying this is better than Endgame, I suppose so, but I look at it as a Kill Bill type situation. They are parts one and two of the same film and as such should be viewed as a whole. Infinity war has so much bang for your buck that Endgame if compared it way flatter, but really they are Cause and effect, setup and resolution.Brilliant, vibrant, funny, highly entertaining and unpredictable stuff.","3/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","gradyharp","18 August 2018","Louder, Longer, Less plot - Groot has the best tool: an iPod..........
There is an audience (and a massive one willing to pay big bucks and stand in long lines ) who champion all of the Marvel Comics films. AVANGERS INFINITY WAR is no exception. At over two and a half hours even the huge cast of gifted actors - at their bet when being funny - explode, blow up things, zoom into outer space for a mission to find Thanos who goal is to rule the universe by obtaining all the funky jewels for his glove - all seem to wear thin from the plodding 'plot' and turn to dust. The true 'stars' of this huge effort are f course the CGI team - the special effects are truly spectacular, at least for the first hour. The characters don't get much time to develop but the actors assigned to the strange roles make the Avengers and their enemies entertaining. The 'plot'? 'As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.'Cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Vin Diesel, Benecio Del Toro, Chris Pratt, William Hurt, Josh Brolin, Gweneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper etc etc etc.

The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on.

It's still one of the best superhero movies ever made. Thanos had made brief appearances in literally three other Marvel movies and we finally got a film focusing on him. Even at the ending credits, it says that Thanos will return and not the Avengers! The plot's pretty standard with the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians Of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from collecting all the Infinity Gems making him the most powerful being in the Universe. The biggest part of this movie is the ending in which...they actually fail.Yep, Thanos gets everything he wants and immediately gains his goal of wanting to kill half the people in the entire Universe! There possibly hasn't been a movie with more deaths of named characters. This was in fact something that happened in the comics, but it seemed so crazy I had no idea it would actually happen here! It's a shame that we don't get to see all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy in the same place at the same time. I believe this is the longest Marvel movie ever made. It certainly didn't seem like it as the pacing was so great!They said this movie would be darker, but it seemed to have a lot of jokes at first. Then came the ending and even the ending credits seemed gloomy. We finally get to see Loki kick the bucket. It's great that we have the characters reference all of their losses.

Infinity War is filled with more super whiners than super heroes; unless you like your superheroes to whimper, demand to be sacrificed, argue, and to die. Not my idea of good times. Not lining up to see the sequel/conclusion. I'd rather read the comics, or watch it on cartoons. Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe.Try to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing. And it was cool to see so many Avengers represented. Had some cool scenes. Gave it a generous 6/10 but will never watch again.Hero up! and watch Super Hero Squad or for something less childish, Avengers Assemble Season 2, which also tells the story of Thanos.","2/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","bgsmall","19 May 2018","Caveats on this review are; I'm no especial fan of comic book storylines made into films, my primary reason for attending was to take my children for their entertainment (not mine).As you might expect from a comic book rendering; the central plot of revolves around Thanos (the 'baddie') intent on decimating humanity by ~50% of it's current number to 'restore balance' to an over-crowded universe that has dwinding supplies and no means to support the ever growing populus. Taking that and the film at face value - this is a bizzare and macarbe storyline that hurtles between fight scenes without any character development or sub-plot development whatsoever (O.K, that's a little unfair - but not much). That's maybe my own fault - as I've not seen the other (precedent) movies in this series. However, as entertainment value goes, it's a little poor and in retrospect I would not have taken my children to see it.Now, taking the central plot as something 'other' than just fantasy I have a couple of questions / statements:
1. Is the storyline in anyway faithful to what was written in the comic book storylines?
2. Who signed off on the budget of this movie? - I'm guessing it cost $$$$$$$ (that's seven, each representing a 10-fold increase in magnitude) at least.
3. Whoever (individual or committee) did sign off on this budget, then also implicitly (or maybe explicitly) approved the premise of the central plot.
4. Given that Hollywood has been used historically to influence audiences and therefore by extrapolation (largely developed world) populations via it's 'messages' (propaganda) is this warning or threat? 
5. I don't believe that a movie of such an incredible budget is signed off without having an ulterior motive (usually paving the way for later films and more money) - and unless I've missed something - they just trashed the franchise??Just because I'm paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get me.","10/10"
"Avengers: Infinity War","ivan-samuelson","4 December 2018","Don't get me wrong. I love the Marvel Universe. I even went back to watch the original Iron Man and forgot that in those days, Disney didn't have their mitts on it yet. It was a Paramount movie. My how times have changed.For me, the movie was all over the place, jumping from earth, to a distant planet, etc. Yes, the war extends across the galaxy, that much is understood, but too many cross stories, and the entire former Avengers team isn't even together. It does set up the 2nd half that comes out in 2019 which looks lie there will be a head-on face-to-face again with two of the Avengers that split apart, especially since, well, you know why.All in all, the CGI graphics were excellent. Very top notch. But, a movie can only look so great before it falls under it's own weight, and I'm sorry, but AIW does just that. Editing is sub-par, there are some good one-liners, but I had just watched Ant Man and the Wasp just before this at home and that was a great movie for me. Funny, hilarious and action packed. This, so-so. Disney is trying way too hard here. Need to get back to reality and ground this series back to how it started.I dare say that AIW is the Marvel Universe's ""The Last Jedi"". Pretty to look at, but empty everywhere else.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","RJBrez","24 January 2021","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end. Enjoy!","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","0U","23 February 2020","This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists.

"Avengers: Endgame","Alex_Lo","5 February 2021","A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","grztxks","14 March 2021","Infinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","uzair-36867","8 February 2021","This film is an achievement unto itself. Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","andreascaloni","16 February 2021","Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.Rating: 9.6.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Abdulxoxo","5 February 2021","Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.
Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.","8/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","Puroo","21 April 2021","It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.","10/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","Filmdokter","25 October 2021","#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.","8/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Jesper2801","26 April 2018","I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","shawneofthedead","25 April 2018","Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero m√™l√©e that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Platypuschow","4 May 2018","Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","cartermain","20 January 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of.

All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours.

"Avengers: Endgame","TheLittleSongbird","2 May 2018","Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","garethvk","24 April 2018","Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.

"Avengers: Endgame","jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","12 June 2018","Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.","8/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","eva3si0n","8 January 2021","The first Marvel film I really liked. Surprisingly in the film there are many spectacular scenes, which are well held and the main transition between them is made seamless, which does not make you miss. And the main thing that surprises the film - the ending, it really makes it clear that Marvel now plays big, since began to break up with the main heroes of the giving films.","8/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","miacoop","7 January 2021","With Thanos come into play you think that the avengers would be able to tackle this problem but no. After re-watching Infinity War multiple times it still gets me because it's sad the ending really is just another cinematic masterpiece which Marvel always pull off and the fight scenes are amazing. Marvel have some of the best actors and the best casts I'm not applaud them for that. No mad Steve was just sexy after mate and I loved it a lot.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","ACollegeStudent","17 December 2021","Rating: 9.0This went where no other mainstream superhero movie went and killed everyone, allowing Thanos to win. The biggest flaw I can think of with this is that there are other ways to achieve Thanos's goal without killing everyone, and there were some plot grievances like Corvus Glaive somehow sneaking all the way to Shuri in the battle unnoticed, and them not just digging under Wakanda's shield to begin with (they did later in the battle). Also, destroying an infinity stone should cause the universe to collapse in some way as explained in Endgame about taking stones from universes, so I'm not sure why none of the main cast raised this issue when destroying the mind stone was ratified into their gameplan (they might have not known better, though). Otherwise, great pacing, a great soundtrack, crisp visuals, seamless comedy, a compelling and humanized villain, and a haunting ending.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Dello_","6 September 2021","Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.","10/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","pranayjalvi","25 April 2018","The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","pjgs200","12 May 2018","I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10.","7/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Horst_In_Translation","4 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once.I think that movies, especially superhero films, often stand and fall with their villain and here we have Thanos played by Josh Brolin as the main antagonist and he is just utterly great and memorable. Maybe you could say that his (self-perceived godly) ambition to erase half the planet is a bit too mathematical, but everything else about him is outstanding and I have virtually no doubt that he will end up as one of the most memorable villains of the movie year 2018. Even in his weaker story lines, like the part with his ""daughter"" that does not feel entirely convincing early on, he shines and elevates the material to a level where it really saves this entire part of the movie. So yes huge thumbs-up for Thanos. And another thumbs-up for virtually everybody else. Except Starlord unfortunately because honestly his grief may have been huge, but the how he basically destroyed the Avengers' effort that had them close to victory was just ridiculous, so to some extent you can blame him for billions of people dying eventually. Or are they really? I believe there will be a new Avengers movie in 2019 by the same team of writers and directors, so the ending may not be as finite as it seemed to be. You can almost call it a duology. Is all hope really lost? We have to wait a year and see. Honestly I doubt it because there will be a Black Panther 2 for sure at some point, so I guess they will find a way to get things right again for the good guys. It will also be interesting to see if they bring back those who died earlier too, not just those that vanished at the very end.Anyway, this film we have here is one that will make a huge impact come awards season 2018/2019 in all technical categories, especially Visual Effects where it is maybe a lock for an Oscar nomination with a great chance to take home the win. Another thing I would like to say about this film is that it is also a triumph in terms of the comedy, which is not always a success in Marvel works. But here there are some really hilarious scenes and as many bad things as I said about Chris Pratt's character earlier, his banter with Thor is hilarious. And there is a lot more of course. Drax is also amazing in that one scene where he stands there doing nothing. You will recognize many other pretty funny moments when you see them. So what is it that made this film so amazing. I would say it is the script this time. It is bold, daring and not scared of anything while never becoming too absurd or unrealistic (and yes that is possible for superhero films *cough* Deadpool *cough* glad we did not see him in here). But the outcome here is the exact opposite of too many cooks spoiling the broth, both character- and writer-wise. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this one and good thing is you really don't need to have seen any other Avengers or Marvel movie to appreciate the quality we were given with this one. I am truly very curious about the sequel and cannot wait to check it out. This third Avengers movie is my favorite 2018 release at the point of April. And it has a huge chance to stay in the top5, probably top3 until the end of the year. It never dragged, which is always a success for this running time and it gets better by the minute the longer it goes. And the way things turn out eventually reminded me a bit of the last Wolverine film ""Logan"". Happy endings are no longer essential. Realism is what it is all about. Highly highly recommended.","8/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","MrDHWong","25 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","numenorsniper-66396","25 November 2021","I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","r96sk","23 January 2021","This is exactly the sorta thing I want from an Avengers film! Full blown, no punches pulled action. In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!Despite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.Like 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.Speaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.There are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.Needless to say, I can't wait to see 'Avengers: Endgame'!","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","vengeance20","8 May 2018","Seriously when are these editors going to get their crap together & cut it! Hm? You don't need to drag a film on & on for what seems like an eternity! Cut the crap! Cut it! Get to the point already!!As usual, story-line was confusing, too wrapped up with own issues other than saving peoples lives, which is what these films have missed the point of over time, not to mention bad editing, & poorly executed narrative. They weren't speaking English as I had no idea what they were talking about half the time or should I say most of the time! Maybe if they cut the cra[ & made the film snappy it probably would've made more sense & instead of dragging the climax out in such a choppy changing like manner (what climax, I'll get to that later) anyway, as well as repetitive, the climaxes ending was all over the place! Bad guys gets ""killed"", comes back again, gets killed, comes back, more chopping & changing, then a slow dragged out scene, then back to the climax! The end outstayed its welcome, & well as soon as it got to the 2hr mark, you knew they need to wrap it up, but it took another 40mins to do that! Damn!And the ending... don't make me laugh!! The ending could've happened much much sooner! So much so they dragged out a climax for this? I mean the ending was an insult alone, without the other reason being that it took them nearly an hour till they gave us this pile of horse crap! Oh my god!!Overall crap! DON'T watch! 2/10","2/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","593PMP","19 June 2018","I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","lisafordeay","6 May 2018","OK I loved the sequel Age Of Ultron as it focused more on the Avengers themselves but I will get into the negatives later.Avengers Infinity War is the prequel to the 2015 film and tells the story of the Avengers who are no longer working together and must try and defeat a giant half monster/ human called Thanos (Josh Brolin)who wants the stones known as the infinity stones. Each one makes Thano more powerful and it's up to the team to somewhat get back together and join the guardians of the galaxy(Chris Pratt, Zoe Salvada,Bradley Cooper). Will they stop Thano?The special effects are very good along with the cinematography. However the film itself is 50/50 for me. The downside of this film was that there was too much going on and I was so dissapointed with the hulk played by Mark Ruffalo as you never see him as the hulk at all this time. Jermery Renner who played Hawkeye was absent in this and the film was so hard to follow e.g what happened to Thor's eye. I felt like it was skipping or whatever.Overall do yourselves a favour and watch the 2015 version instead or try and watch all the Marvel films to get used to the story.Also has Tom Holland,Robert Downey Jr,Gwyneth Paltrow,Don Cheadle,Chadwick Boseman,Karen Gillian and even a cameo by Stan Lee.","5/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","blparker-31738","27 April 2018","All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","TheBigSick","4 May 2018","SPOILER: The plot is simple that the supervillian succeeds, but Russo brothers waste too much time on piling up the superheroes. The film is just too long, and you keep looking at the watch to see when it will end. There are too many characters, and if you did not view the previous Marvel films, you would hardly get any sense of who they are. It is an OK film for Marvel fans, but chaos for a general audience.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Prismark10","3 May 2018","When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.","6/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","saraccan","11 May 2018","If i can somehow oversee the fact that this is just another glorified cgi fueled version of wwe, its an okay action movie.It's still very much soulless, incredibly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie matters in any way because there can be infinite amounts of prequels and/or sequels and also, certain people can control time in any way they desire. I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters.Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of ""wait, where are we?"" or ""wait, why are they fighting again?"". This one felt more compact to me. GOOD JOB!That said i still don't care about anything that happened or will happen in these superhero movies. I did pay for a ticket and therefore contributed to the financing of future films though, so you're welcome.","2/10"

Most of the things I expect from the Avengers were absent in this film. There was very little working together to defeat a Foe; and way too much about the Bad Guy -- Thanos. Like, why do I care?

As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.","6/10"

Then there are products is one soap powder really better than this other, or a $1000 perfume can it really be better say than one at a mere $10, beauty they say is in the eye of the beholder! So they say. Then there is this new mega movie Avengers Infinity War, now i would take issue with anyone that this is actually a movie at all, it is a consumer product the must see/ have accessory for the moment, Pre-sold, Pre-packaged to a ready made audience desperate to spend their money, it is just another fashionable element in today's throw away age. Telephones i believe are sold this way, at least this is how i see the commercial world of now. Now, i know my views are in total opposition to the frankly ridiculous high score's on this web site, and please don't think i am not grateful, my local multiplex needs big profit films to survive and hopefully prosper so the likes of me can see proper films that are real cinematic experiences but make next to no money, usually that's the fate of most superior films these day's! 
Can i be positive in any way about this Marvel, well i saw it in 4DX & 3D, the chair swam and jolted, there were lights, flashes, and sprays or did i imagine the last one, oh yes, the sound was loud, very very loud. and Oh yes do not forget, it is extremely long, very very long, like a bad flight across the Atlantic but without the benefits of a helpful service attendant's tray. Did i enjoy it? in any way, well no, just too much of a good thing, i like sugar in my tea, but 32 spoons is to much! This i will call it for ease, a film, it just had too much of everything. Now, i can just imagine steam boiling over from most readers that i am clearly to old and out of touch, but i argue not so, the trailer for Deadpool 2 was so funny and inventive that i am eagerly awaiting this release. As for all these many many super hero's to numerous to remember and to numerous to mention, i do have a question for superhero's obviously adoring public the question is, are the comic books any better?","4/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","brianjohnson-20043","8 May 2018","I like the stand alone Marvel Movies more, but it almost feels like an obligation to see all of them if you want to see the ones you like, or else, you'll have no idea what's going on when the ones you like continue. I'm prefacing with that so readers understand that I'm not just a hater.First off, I want to address the villain. My opinions I've heard/read asserted Thanos is a strength to this film. I found that to be the opposite. I found his motivation more convincing than the Justice League villains, who were so bad, I can't even really remember their motivation, and a bit less stupid than Ultron who was the AI thing that might have seemed like a real issue in the 80s or early 90s. But today it seems clear that the misuse of technology to our demise is going to be gradual rather than sudden. The vulture from Spider Man Homecoming, or the villain from Black Panther were much more compelling In my Opinion. Thanos felt like a cartoonish version of the villain Samuel Jackson played in the first Kingsmen movie. Except that Thanos didn't work like how the similar villain in Kingsmen worked. They're both trying to save everything by killing off a sizable chunk of people before people kill their planet or planets. The difference is that Thanos wants to randomly and painlessly kill half of everyone everywhere, and Valentine wants to save a few chosen wealthy friends. Overpopulation and idiocy is a real issue on earth. But in the Marvel Universe, it's a planet to planet issue, and it seems stupid to just kill off half of everyone on some planets which might not have any actual problems. And this issue is never even questioned by any of the characters. They just try to play the card that Thanos should try to save people, not kill them. Not a bad point. But it didn't seem like any of the Avengers seemed even remotely interesting in addressing Thanos' concerns. Not even Gamora. Plus, if someone gets two or three of these infinity stones, let alone all of them, can't they use that person yield that power to do good rather than evil? It just didn't settle very well with me. Loki was a much better villain because he's like the Joker. Destruction and chaos is his high. That's a real thing in people that an audience should be able to understand.The strength of this movie is the humor. I laughed repeatedly and was certainly entertained in that regard. It also, no surprise, looked really good and had great music. I was surprised how well the Guardians characters fit in with the other Marvel characters. But to me a feature length movie, even a short one, can't be good if the story isn't compelling. And this movie is long. If the villain's story was halfway decent it would have stood a good shot, but just getting characters together that one likes and making a spectacle, won't make up for giant flaws in the story. I didn't expect everything to be concluded, because these movie all set up more to come. But with an ending like this film has, it should have been advertised as the 1st part of 2 movies from the start. I really don't get how the next Ant-Man movie is going to work after what happened here in Inifinity Wars. Unless it takes place prior to the events of Infinity Wars, I don't see it working. But if that's the case, why not have Ant Man 2 come out first? I'm not a comic book reader. I open them up, look at the picture and think:""I'm supposed to take these silly-looking overdramatic characters and pictures seriously? Do other people see how goofy these images are? What am I, 10? But I've heard from friends who like the comics that much of the events of this film unfolded as they did to stay loyal to the events in the comics. My response to this is that every form of entertainment's first goal should be to work within its own form. To me Infinity Wars' narrative doesn't work for a feature movie. I was upset with how it ended. And I know I wasn't the only one in the theater upset. And I find it disgraceful that, at the moment, this movie has 8.9 stars out of 10. Black Panther doesn't have 8 and it's actually good. What's wrong with people? This movie is currently ranked ahead of movies like 12 Angry Men, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, It's a Wonder life, American History X, The Prestige or Every Single Pixar Movie. What is wrong with people?","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","hawkins_saints_rock","25 April 2018","Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable. The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them. My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it. Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves. 9.8/10","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","eden-rabatsch","25 April 2018","Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.","3/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","nodlimax","28 April 2018","This movie has various problems and the first major one is the lack of focus. We keep jumping around to various places and I can't even keep where all of them were.One moment, we are on earth, the next on Knowhere, the next on some other planet to which I can't even remember the name. And it's not just the places, it's the characters too. There isn't one lead or even 5 lead characters we can somewhat focus on. They try to focus on everybody which means nobody is the actual lead character. There was another movie that was initially praised but in the end was heavily critizised for lacking focus on a real main character - that was Star Wars The Phantom Menace. I see the same problem in this regard here with the story.Due to the lack of focus the movie also has pacing issues and therefore to me felt boring. And then this goes on for 150 minutes. And the biggest problem at the end of the movie is that there is no payoff.......ok stop, I have to correct myself there. The payoff (here comes the spoiler) is, that the bad guy wins. Everything the heroes tried to do failed and you know what I was actually kinda rooting for Thanos, because I couldn't care enough about any of the other characters. He became the protagonist for me, which makes me feel terrible as well, because he kills half the population in the universe.In the end I was just happy that the movie was over. However the writers put themselfes in a corner. Thanos is pretty much god at this point and objectively speaking there is no way anyone could defeat him at this point except if they go for something like ""his glove lost the power after he used it"" which is cheap. That will then result in the heroes trying to get back the time stone and then turning back time or something similar stupid.I will not see the next one in cinema. At this point I am pretty much done with superhero movies. I guess I can thank Disney now for first pushing me away from Star Wars and now Marvel.The effects and sound were decent though.","6/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","deastman_uk","28 April 2018","How long has it been since the Dark Knight? The DC film that defined how an epic comic book fantasy could wrap a world around a hero and a villain.Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.","1/10"

Judging by the way it has been positively reviewed by some other IMDB members, I cannot help but wonder if we watched the same movie. I fell asleep repeatedly during the opening night screening in my city and I lost most interest in it after 90 minutes or so. (The run time was much too long.) While I've enjoyed quite a few of these Marvel big-screen productions in recent years, I didn't enjoy this one very much at all. Unless you're a comic book fan, I'd take a pass on this one.","4/10"

This is not even the best Marvel movie this year(Black Panther had better story & drama), definitely nowhere near 'best superhero movie ever'. The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence. For the record, I loved Avengers, loved Winter Soldier so it is not like I cannot enjoy a superhero flick. This one is not(unless you are a fanboy(girl).","7/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Lursa","6 May 2018","SPOILER ALERT!!
I am a Marvel Chick. I totally dig the whole Marvel Verse and wave my 'fangirl flag' proudly. I was looking forward to this movie so much...then something happened. I went to see it today. I did not read any of the reviews before I went. I never do. I always view a film without input from folk that usually don't know what I like. So there I was, popcorn and coke in hand. Two rows back from the screen ('cause I'm into total immersion, okay) in my reclining seat. Ten minutes in and I know we're in trouble. It's not the fact that two of my favorite characters didn't survive the opening credits. This is Infinity War, right? People are gonna die. It's just seemed so pointless. Loki dies but Thor survives? How is that fair? Hemdall dies saving Hulk of all people?? Not that I'm hatin' on Hulk...but come on, Hemdall! You have sworn an oath to the 'Thone of Asgard' and you don't save EITHER of the princes? Really?? I know Hulk is refusing to 'come out' after Thanos kicks his butt that no one ever has before but still...The movie goes rapidly downhill from here. Thanos and his twisted cult of psychopaths got on my nerves early and they danced all over them until the end of the film. We bounce all over the world (and off it) to keep Thanos away from the Infinity stones. Who decided that two of the most important stones be 'hidden' on earth? Not a good idea. Our Merry Band of Marvel Heroes needs to take a page out of the Star Trek verse. 'The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few or the one.' This could have saved SO many lives. Loki gives Thanos the Tesseract to save Thor. Thanos tried to kill them all anyway. Actually succeeds in killing both Loki, Hemdall and all of the Asgardians. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, the daughter he loves. (Thanos has a really weird idea of what love entails...but whatever) He does this so he can gain access to the Soul Stone. Dr. Strange gives Thanos the Time Stone to save Tony Stark. (Tony Stark? Wasn't his expiration date up like a couple years ago?? ) This gives Thanos the power to turn back time whenever he wants. Which he does after Scarlett Witch kills Vision (her lover) to destroy the Mind Stone. He just turns back time. Rips the stone out of Vision's head and heads off to wipe out life as we know it. So Scarlett Witch went through all that gut wrenching heartache for nothing.This could have been a good movie. Maybe even a great one but it's not. It's a mishmash of the worst parts of just about every Marvel movie over the past 10 years. There are a few notable omissions. Most of the gang is on deck but they're so ineffective. They rehash the same differences they had in their other movies showing little or no growth or development aside from the superficial 'romantic' themes. I get that Pepper and Tony are an item. We knew this already. I get that Black Widow and Bruce are an item. We knew this two movies ago. Same with Gamora and Peter, Scarlett Witch and Vision. and on and on and on. This is supposed to make their loss more poignant but it doesn't. The fight sequence in Wakanda and on Thanos home planet were so predictable. Such a waste of excellent CGI and actors.The only surprise in the movie is who survives. Thor, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers survive. I know this is to set up the next part of the Infinity War set that is scheduled to hit theaters later this year. The Russo boys need to step up their game. This disappointment does not bode well for the new film. Guys. sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Just FYI. You just know that someone is going to get hold of the time stone and turn back time so we can blah, blah, blah. Been there, done that. I really wanted to love this movie. I really, really did. But I left the theater feeling used and not in a good way. I felt like Marvel turned up the manipulation meter to eleven. Because, you know it's eleven which is one more than ten, right?I rated the movie a '4' because I wanted it to be good. It just wasn't.","2/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","gcarpiceci","2 May 2018","Sometimes when you cook a dish for your guests, you think that you'll make it more tasteful if you keep adding ingredients over ingredients; so, you have made this nice pizza, you have put your tomato sauce, your mozzarella cheese, maybe some ham, then you think why not some mushrooms, and well peppers will be just perfect on top it, and don't forget olives and cappers, hey we have some sausage in the fridge just slam it on top of it....etc. Most likely your guests will spend the night wrestling with your heavy-loaded pizza, trying to digest it.
Well, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars.
Note that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc...

"Avengers: Endgame","TheSeaLion","1 May 2018","While all of the heroes from across the Marvel cinematic universe united in a joint effort to stop Thanos, so too did all of the problems you can think of unite in a joint effort to bring down ""Infinity War.""It should be noted that I am not the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the most part, I find the movies to be passable while there are a few I have really liked, such as ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and some I have despised, such as ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers."" ""Infinity War"" could have fallen anywhere on the spectrum for me, and unfortunately, it fell at the way-down low side as the second worst movie in the entire franchise.The opening scene of the movie is the perfect setup for what is wrong with ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attacking an Asgardian ship with all of the main characters from ""Thor: Ragnarok"" on it. Thanos has killed everyone aboard, except for the few characters necessary to help keep the plot moving. Heimdall (Idris Elba) is left wounded so that he can be killed off by Thanos on screen after using his powers to send Hulk (Bruce Banner) to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers. It is supposed to be an emotional death scene, but the laziness of the writing and the showcasing of character stupidity for the purpose of plot progression is all too evident. Why didn't Thanos just kill Heimdall during the attack on the ship like he did with everyone else on board? It's simple: the plot would not be able to continue if he had done that.Character stupidity is at an all time high in ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" and it is not just restricted to Thanos. There is a lack of communication between characters for no reason other than for the movie to happen, and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) goes so far as to screw everything up in what is easily the worst written scene in the entire movie.The stupidity of the characters can all be attributed to an awfully written script. So much of the dialogue in the movie is the Marvel quips, but a lot of it comes in the form of characters throwing personal jabs at one another to the point of wondering why these heroes can't set aside their differences and not be annoying for even five minutes in order to stop a villain who wants to wipe out half of the universe's population.Yep, that's right. Thanos' goal is to wipe out half of the population of the entire universe. One complaint that people have had with Marvel is how safe their characters all feel. So, Thanos killing off half the population would seem like it was putting their characters in danger, right? Wrong. All of the characters who are killed by Thanos are the characters who had already overstayed their welcome in the franchise or do not feel permanent because, let's be honest, they are needed for future installments to the Marvel universe. It is ironic that the movie that seemingly takes the most risks is the movie that played things the safest.Even if these deaths did feel like a risk, it would not really matter. With so many characters to focus on, the movie has almost no time for character arcs (which is fine) and instead must show its characters through their speech and actions. However, so many of these characters act so annoying or stupid that you are just wishing for them to be killed off, and then the characters who are killed at the end by Thanos destroying half the population lacks any emotional weight because after nearly three hours of unbearable characters and dialogue, it is just a relief that the movie is almost over.The two things that ""Infinity War"" did well was not making the story feel jumbled and clustered with all of the characters, and they did do a good job with the characters of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany), but that is it. When it comes to everything else, the movie falls prey to a term film critic Roger Ebert used, which is 'idiot plot.'Idiot plot means that the only way for the plot to happen is for the characters to act like idiots, which I already went into a little bit to explain how even the smartest of characters have to act like morons in this movie for the plot to progress, but the entire plot of the movie is an idiot plot as well. Thanos' plan to wipe out half of the population only makes sense to the point of his backstory. In execution, it is a plan that falls apart and becomes dumber the more you think about it. This might be, though, because the movie tries to paint Thanos and his plan off as having depth to it, but this sort of plan would only make sense and work for a generic super hero villain who just wants to destroy the world because he is evil. So, with a villain with faux-depth and an evil plan that would only work for a generic super villain character, the overall plot of the movie is a dumb villain scheme that has awful juxtaposition to it.""Infinity War,"" to put it simply, is just awful. Nothing more, nothing less. And for a movie this big that had a decade of hype and buildup and planning, that is just sad.","6/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","imaxxing","3 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. 
That being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. 
Infinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.
 
So, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.Great CGI.No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.Too many characters.The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. 
For the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.It bordered on a comedy.For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. 
While some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.Geared towards a younger audience. As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents. It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. 
Most of us have outgrown the cliches. Poor ending.Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling. A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film.Overall 6.4/10","8/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","AGood","4 May 2018","This film was literally 2 and a half hours of non stop roller coaster action. This may sound like the perfect movie. But just think of this for a moment.The film was literally;Villian comes on the scene, whichever avengers is around flies or runs at them. Gets bounced back. Flies again, gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back.Then an escape happens, as the villian always gets what he come for as even his minions are way too powerful for every single avenger in the film. Cue literally 2mins of wisecracking and jokes. Next scene cuts eslewhere, villian comes on the scene, avenger flies or runs at them, gets bounced back, then 2 more mins of wisecracking and jokes..... for 2 and a half hours.The diaglogue is minimal in the extreme. Possibly only 200 or so words get said in total throughout the whole 2 and a half hour movie. Almost all of it is just filler wisecracking jokes.Watching this movie honestly felt like watching someone else play a video game, with the 2min cut scenes kept in.I don't know if I am getting old, or if it was just this film but I did not enjoy this. I loved black panther that I seen a month ago. But also hated Justice Leage so am not sure. I get the feeling kids will love this and think it the most epic thing they have ever seen.

Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings .","2/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","dcortner-19918","10 January 2024","The best Marvel movie to date IMO. Fantastic all-around. The pacing was spot on, and I was very concerned about it going in. I thought I'd be feeling bored or dragging around the 2hr mark. But when Thanos reached Wakanda, I knew things were ending soon and I actually remember thinking I didn't want it to end.The cast were all stellar in their roles. Love Cap's new look. Really enjoyed seeing RDJ back on-screen as Iron Man as well. Tom Holland really surprised me with how emotional that Spider-Man death scene was. The ""I don't want to go"" got to me.I thought we'd get some exposition or the Avengers reuniting in some capacity first, but I'm glad we opened with a Thanos attack. It helped establish the pace and set the tone. The movie kept that tone throughout. Thanos is a badass, but I also really enjoyed seeing his backstory and character. In his own twisted way, he definitely did care for Garmora. The relief on his face at the end was a really strong moment. He completed his goal, in his eyes he's done the universe a great justice and now he can just relax.I do hope that at least Loki & Gamora stay dead. I understand those that vanished are going to come back but I think bringing those 2 back would be a bit extreme.I thought for sure Tony Stark or Steve Rodgers were going to bite the bullet in this one. But it just makes me that much more intrigued to see where things go from here.Also, I have to shoutout the score. The music in this film was incredible. I'm not familiar with Alan Silvestri but he did an amazing job. The score enhanced every single scene, and helped immerse me into this world. Fantastic work.","10/10"

Most of the men act like 12 year old boys, arguing at the drop of a hat. That's supposed to be Stark's gimmick, but most of the heroes (males) act that way. There's no difference between Stark, Peter Parker or even Dr. Strange or even his Buddhist buddy.Most of the dialogue is banter. Mostly the so called actors pose their way through scenes.

Thanos is collecting the six Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet to execute his evil plan. The heroes of the MCU struggle to stop him.It is amazing that this works as well as it does. This could be best described as The Empire Strikes Back portion of the MCU so far. The heroes get their butts kicked from one end of the universe to the other. It ends with a mass disintegration which is honestly even sadder and much darker than TESB. TESB ends bittersweet but this is just dark. Although anybody with a brain would see that the snap will be reversed in some way. There are many deaths that cannot happen which does diminishes the shock value of the ending. They can't kill off Spider-Man because the MCU doesn't even own him. Sony would never let it happen. They also can't kill off Black Panther due to his future movie and more importantly, his new popularity. Obviously, some characters will not make it but I think the vast majority will rise from the dead. The constant death reversals in the MCU saps away the shock value and that's probably this movie's main drawback. If they picked different characters to disintegrate, I might have doubts about reversing it.The advantage of the MCU is that these characters are so familiar that none of them needs introduction. In fact, this one starts from the end of Thor: Ragnarok and is no worst off by it. The relationships are well established. It's great fun to have them run into other heroes they've never met. Thor joining the Guardians generates a whole lot of hilarity. Drax is especially funny. Quill's insecurities is fun. There is an interesting pairing of Stark and Dr. Strange with Spider-Man as a fun sidekick. Relationships continue to be the strength of this franchise. The heroes are so well defined that the movie can spend its time with the villain. One of this franchise's weakness has always been the lackluster villains but Thanos is allowed to have his character development. His view points and his love for his daughter Gamora give him real depth. In many ways, this is Thanos' movie and it is more compelling due to the development.I do have some other minor issues. The giant Dinklage may be oddly cute at first but it's just odd. That section doesn't have the same action as Wakanda. Thor holding open the iris is not much of an action scene. I'd rather have that section finish quicker without flipping back and forth there. I would push that section back into the middle. The plan for Vision's stone seems like a low percentage play and his reasoning for sacrificing himself seems much more poetic. There has to be a way to do a ""needs of the many"" scene earlier and end in the same place anyways. Overall, this is well-constructed, well-conceived, and well-made. Despite the darkness, it still has its fun. The plot never stalls. The villains are great. The heroes are never in doubt. The franchise continues to be in good hands.","1/10"

This entry was abt an hour too long and way too slow to develop. I had trouble staying awake at times. The final battle scene was OK but the entire movie was dark.

"Avengers: Endgame","phoenixinvictus","6 August 2018","I can almost guess how the sequel is going to go... they are going to use some ridiculous time travel trick to undo all of Thanos damage. This two and a half hour movie was nothing more than a ten minute cameo for each actor to fight some alien.
The HUGE plot hole in this movie is Thanos ""plan"" and Ant-Man's mysterious absence in this movie. Let's see how absurd the plot hole of this movie is... Thanos' master plan is to wipe out half the population of the Universe because according to him there aren't enough resources for us all. Have you seen the size of the Universe??? The resources are almost endless! The Universe is a BIG place people! How can anyone not point that out to him? With his magic gauntlet complete he can just ""magic"" all the resources he wants with the snap of his fingers. Duh! But that is not all... Ant-Man possesses the technology to END WORLD HUNGER!!! All he needs to do is supersize ""a steak"" to the size of a ""truck"" and presto you can feed an entire city for weeks. Right there is the weapon to end Thanos' dumb logic.
Almost right in the beginning of the movie Thanos kills off the Asgardians on the ship, except for the main characters because... well just because we'll dump logic out of window and not bother the audience. Thanos then kills Loki-for REAL this time. Let me please have a moment to laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA! Even if Loki is really dead this time I cannot feel anything but amusement at this ridiculous death for he has died so many times that I have lost count! Why should I feel sorry for a guy who wanted humans to worship him as a living god? Wasn't this the guy who literally placed his father in an old folks home to rot away? Wasn't he the one responsible for starting a war of genocide? Wasn't he the one who was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people and caused the near destruction of New York City? Wasn't he the one who caused the invasion of New York City by aliens?
Let's face facts! Nearly every Marvel character has died and been brought back to life that it actually is getting boring!
Heimdall who is wounded uses the last of his powers to transport Hulk\Bruce Banner to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers instead of-I don't know- beaming the tesseract away from Thanos. How about sending it to the edge of the Universe? It's not like he has a locating beacon to find these things.
Gamora wants to stay away from Thanos because she knows something that he wants and makes Star Lord promise her he will kill her (yeah right). Gamora then does the very thing she said she wouldn't do and runs directly to Thanos to engages him in battle where we all know that she will lose.
Aliens attack New York again. What an unlucky city. Doctor Strange is abducted and Wong doesn't seem to care that his friend is in danger and returns home... Really Wong, I'm so disappointed with you! Why doesn't he open up a portal to rescue his BFF? I know that Doctor Strange wouldn't have abandoned him... of course there is the fact that Wong's ten minutes were up and the studio couldn't afford him. Okay Wong I forgive you. Doctor Strange doesn't use his magic gem to turn back time and ""bargain"" with Thanos. Why doesn't he do it? With the help of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spiderman and Star Lord they hatch up a ""plan"" to remove the magic gauntlet off Thanos rather than just cut off the guy's arm off! Star Lord being the screw up that he is screws up the entire plan. Doctor Strange simply gives up the time gem because it's the only way to prolong this agonizing movie for another hour! Why didn't I just stop watching this movie?
Captain America who is a fugitive is suddenly pardoned because he is just so darn good looking and awesome in his costume. Vision says that he won't trade a life for a life but there were so many lives lost during the battle to remove the stone from his head. Wakanda is invaded and the Hulk refuses to come out of the closet... So why was he saved and not someone else? Does anyone care? Why didn't Wong and his friends appear in the final battle and lock the evil alien army into the ""mirror dimension""? I'm just saying... Everyone dies and we all know that they aren't going to stay that way. These movies get worse and worse each year.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","robert-85923","11 May 2018","I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular.However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly. At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before. I just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle... When it finally did end I felt cheated of the time.","3/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","welhof1","5 December 2021","This was just as you expected. High action with some light hearted comedy thrown in. The plot had me guessing a couple times.

"Avengers: Endgame","antialias11","13 May 2018","*** Warning, mild spoilers ahead *** Ok, what sticks out about this movie? Nothing much. 
The acting is lackluster. No character has a character arc - understandable because none of them are given any significant screen time. The whole movie is basically one endless 3-hour brawl (with some battle scenes blatantly ripped from Star Wars/Lord of the Rings). Some of the brawls are so over-the top that they are ludicrous (even by comicbook standards). Example: When you break a moon into pieces and hurl all of them at someone on the planet below within one second then the impacting pieces should not just make a puff of dust when they land. The motivation of the villain makes no sense (after achieving his goal the universe will just be back to the earlier situation soon enough). Given that it's hard to emote with a villain in the first place having a full CGI villain makes it even less likely. Some of Gamoras mood swings in the matter where we're supposed to emote with him or her make even less sense.Speaking of CGI: It's on a level we've come to expect with some weird exceptions. E.g. in one instance we see Bruce Banner's head in the open cockpit of the Hulkbuster armor while he's standing around in the background - and it looks like someone just copied it in with MS-Paint. Seriously. Not even Photoshop quality but MS-Paint.The humor is relegated to one-liners and most don't land. The serious one-liners are predictable and pithy. 
The music score is effective if somewhat over-the-top pathos-heavy (but that's not unusual for US films, so it' one of those things we've come to expect to have to endure)The overwhelming feeling is that this movie was ""designed by comittee"". The boardroom idea seems to have been: ""Take the things that people enjoyed in other movies and make them non-stop"". 
Problem is: It doesn't work that way. Gems in movies are that because they are rare. Taking the time to lead up to them makes the payoff all that sweeter.After coming back I rewatched the first Avengers movie just to see if my memory deceived me. But no: It is a way, way, WAY superior film in every respect.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Jared_Andrews","5 May 2018","Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection. There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges. Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all. I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts. Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does.The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve.So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea. For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless.Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected. The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians. The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. 
Spiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony ""Mr. Stark"" and Tony calls Peter ""kid."" There's a certain father-son/mentor-prot√©g√© sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever.Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music.Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints.1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him ""Vizz"" is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention.
2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it.
3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie.Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did. Join the phenomenon and see Infinity War today. If you love superheroes, you will probably love this movie.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","gavinp9","25 April 2018","SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much. The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista). The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Leofwine_draca","29 December 2019","So, here we have it: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the Marvel climax to a string of approximately twenty prior movies and considered by many to be the crowning achievement of the genre thus far. And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!","3/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","MxS7HGS","28 January 2024","Infinity War is a favorite among superhero fans. It tells the story of how the Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, confront Thanos, an Eternal, who is determined to gather all six infinity stones and wipe out half of the universe's population. The fate of the universe rests on their shoulders.It begins with a high stakes opening sequence on a ship, where Thanos and his children are introduced with well-written dialogue and a powerful score by Alan Silvestri. The Hulk's confrontation with Thanos showcases the sheer might of the Eternal, establishing him as a formidable adversary for the Avengers.Despite a large cast of characters, it balances them well without feeling overstuffed. It tells a compelling story in two and a half hours, maintaining consistently fast pacing. It features notable performances from actors like Josh Brolin, who plays Thanos with great intensity and Robert Downey Jr., who delivers some of the best-acted emotion in the entire MCU, adding depth to his character.However, some parts of the movie are criticized for feeling contrived or lacking in visual appeal. For example, the moment when Starlord punches Thanos feels forced, and the CGI and aging effects on certain suits are questionable.Despite these flaws, Infinity War is a monumental achievement in the MCU's early phases and stands as a convincing assertion that these films are indeed a form of cinema.","5/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","realmuthaf","6 May 2018","Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good.The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway.There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone ""for balance"" with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah.Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around.I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable. This, however, just continues the downward trend of movies like Guardians 2 and Thor 3.","1/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Shadowboy_25cm","23 November 2021","""Avengers: Infinity War"" culminates the 10 years build-up of the MCU to this first part finale:The villain is very powerful, complex and interesting to watch, although his final art design is not that impressive as other impressive versions of Thanos.There is a lot of super-hero drama, a lot of apocalyptic atmosphere, a lot of smart subplots and impressive locations, there is a lot of surprise.The movie is very watchable and constructed somehow around best-of-scenes, very fast-paced, jumping from one important fight and conflict to another leaving behind some logic. The action and the SFX are impressive, I as a viewer have nearly none time to chill out,
it's a tour de force till the final battle. Very courageous by the makers to finish this movie as a Part 1-movie of a 2-part-finale (just like the new ""Dune"" movie by Denis Villeneuve in 2021).It's a good MCU movie (it's better than the second part ""Avengers: Endgame"") that relies on the former MCU movies to keep it as a fast-paced, gripping story till the end.Highly recommended.","8/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","maruugaa","18 May 2018","I'm not a fan of Marvel or DC or basically anything that Disney creates. Unfortunately, my friend wanted to see it and I figured:
1) There's a chance it could be good, considering there were other movies I thought were going to be bad, such as(Blockers, The Purge, Keanu, and even Wonder Woman) that turned out to be good, so I shouldn't pass this off right away just because it's Disney
2) I figured it couldn't be worse than Red Sparrow.Anyway, I was wrong to both of those. This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence.The only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade.The entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life.With the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class. Also, as someone who was forced to go to Catholic Church as a kid, if you've ever gone to the Good Friday or Palm Sunday mass where they all read that dialogue in monotonous voices that's so insufferable you're in pain? That's how I felt in this movie. I would've rather been a child at Good Friday mass again, because at least then there was prospect of a Cream Egg for sitting through that drawl.","9/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","PedanticEditor","2 June 2018","This movie is shockingly bad, especially compared with the other avengers films, and is the absolute worst Marvel movie ever made. Almost as bad as the Batman vs. Superman movie was for the DC universe. Fair warning, this review is all spoilers - not that it really matters since you shouldn't see the film anyway.I saw the film today and I can't help but conclude that the writers of this film were just lazy. For shame! I get that Infinity War is supposed to be the first part of a two-parter, so pretty much all the good guys had to die. But there are ways of making good guys lose without having them act like lobotomy patients throughout the whole story and literally die from stupidity every step of the way (oh, except for Spiderman who is inexplicably the only intelligent character in the story). In what ways were the good guys unbelievably dumb every step of the way, you ask? I'll tell you. And then I'll tell you what some better written alternatives could have been. This is just from memory, so there are probably more instances of bad writing that I've forgotten.1. Loki gives up a stone to save Thor, even though it may be possible to resurrect him later and Loki knows half the universe will die as an eventual result.2. Loki goes after the more-powerful-than-gods Thanos a moment later with a knife. An effing knife!3. The first thing Dr. Strange does is as Ironman for help. Whaa?4. Dr. Strange gets tangled up in weeds and faints, then to be carried off like a swooned and helpless fairytale maiden.5. Gamora attacks Thanos first, by herself, even though she knows she alone holds the key to a stone.6. Gamora gives up the final stone to relieve her sister from momentary torture, knowing that half of all life in the universe will die as a result.7. Wakanda opens its forcefield, and the super-duper powerful lady stops guarding the last stone in order to fight.8. Star Lord prevents the other good guys from removing the infinity stone holder from Thanos by deliberately saving Thanos from the mind control lady.9. Ironman didn't punch Star Lord's lights out when he saw that he was getting ready to do something moronic.10. Neither did Dr. Strange.11. Thor stabs the Thanos through the chest with a super-axe (which was obviously stupid in the first place, but even then he has time to pull it back out and chop off the baddy's head), and instead the baddy says ""You should have gone for the head"" and sucks himself into a portal to escape.12. Last, and least important but still annoying, the Hulk is effectively impotent for no good reason.Here are 3 Possible solutions off the top of my head that would have been less poorly written:1. Dr. Strange is distracted by something even more important for the entire movie, so that the other heroes can die tragically, and in the second movie he stops being too busy and just rolls back time and undoes Thanos' acquisition of the stones - also causing the heroes to not die.2. Same thing, except Dr. Strange or his compatriot could have opened up and closed one of their portal thingies to snip off Thanos' arm with the stones on it.3. Thor could have died trying to make the super-axe, or he could have cut off Thanos' head and someone else evil could quickly put on the stone-holding glove thing instead. Either way would have been an improvement.","3/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","rowpotdroid","29 April 2018","Suffering hype fatigue, over a year of industry talk about this movie in pre release. It takes away from viewing the movie. In the end it's just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age. The first avengers was original. But now what Hollywood movie makers due best, take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs. Sorry about raining on your Hollywood comic book Heroes block borer. But the only hero I can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels. They've become boring and predictable recycles. I spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie. Seems Hollywood is addicted to CGI for making movies that shouldn't be made. If they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up, no story, plot or actors acting just things blowing up.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","bob the moo","27 August 2018","I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.","2/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","bradykitchen-33648","15 March 2022","This film is phenomenal. I have no other way of putting it, they do a amazing job especially with how big this film is. The Russo brothers do a crazy good job with managing this huge cast. Every character is given some sort of purpose and their time to shine and it makes for through the roof entertainment but also a well written movie.This film has a really big advantage over other MCU films, all of the characters except for one have been developed. It allows the movie to focus far more on the plot and making a quality story and less so on showing who these characters are. This movie is very fast paced, which creates what is the most entertaining MCU film.The one character that was developed was Thanos played by Josh Brolin. He is the best MCU villain because he was developed. Almost all of the MCU films have one issue and that is the villain. Most MCU villains are not given enough development to be considered a good villain. Thanos is the polar opposite. This film does an amazing job of explaining his character and explaining his motive. There are a few times where you actually ponder whether he is right and that shows how well written Thanos is.The action in this film is insanely well managed. You get to see each character have their action moment and makes for a really entertaining watch. The comedy was also very good and I feel they managed it a lot better than other MCU instalments. I find a lot of MCU projects use comedy at inappropriate times whereas this film did not.In terms of gripes there were a lot of plot holes, which is hard to fault them on because of how much they already have to deal with but plot holes are there and they need to be mentioned.Overall this film is amazing. The Russos do an insane job with managing this giant cast while providing the best MCU villain to date.9.5/10.","10/10"

Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just ""world domination."" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.","2/10"

And she was also one of my favorites10) the dialogue was weak in the movie as a whole and most of the ""comedic"" moments weren't funny outside of Star-Lord, who was great by the way 11) the dialogue was weird between between Gamora and thanos.

"Avengers: Endgame","TheNabOwnzz","2 August 2018","Since i am not a little boy that has an absurd kind of fondness for Marvel comics & thus its movies, i am able to judge them objectively without being prejudiced by a couple of adults flying around in capes. And with this knowledge, it is quite obvious that Infinity War is indeed objectively a terrible movie.As stated before i am admittedly not a Marvel fan, and i did not care to watch any of its predecessors before this one. It ofcourse should never be a requirement to watch about 18 films in order to comprehend this one better, but to be honest you really don't miss anything during Infinity War's simplistic narrative if you have missed all its previous films, except for maybe knowing the characters in it. But judging from what i have seen none of them are even slightly relatable even when having watched previous films. So even if you have watched previous films, a connection with these characters is impossible since they are so terrible written and often times poorly acted.First off, i cannot fathom enough how terrible the screenplay is. A couple of characters try to be funny and come up with lines of dialogue a 8 year old could have though of, such as: 'Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards' or 'Why is Gamora', or the discussion about Thor's new haircut. The plain stupidity in its dialogue and writing is basically an insult to the audience's intelligence, and thus it is a very dumb and low IQ motion picture due to this. The acting is mostly terrible, except by perhaps Josh Brolin ( Which is saying a lot, since he was a pure CGI character ). Especially Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt & Tom Holland all hand in absolutely atrocious and horrendous performances. All of them try to be funny and joke around in serious times, but it is never funny, instead its terrible pretentious attempt at creating wisecracks results in loads of cringeworthy scenes that will make the audience embarrassed to witness. Although in the three actors's defence, the abysmal script didn't help their performances either, and they are only partly to blame.The only interesting character in the film is Thanos, and while it does help a little bit that he has the most screen time of all characters by far, he still seems to be a victim of the clich√© fest that is Infinity War since his reasons for wanting to take over the world are hardly original ( Sacrifice the few to save the many kind of motivations, which we have all seen before ), and can probably be found in the 'Standard Hollywood villain rules guide book' anywhere. None of the 'Good guys' are relatable because their dialogue is so ridiculous and since the only intelligent person in the film seems to be Thanos, as everybody else seems to be lacking in self awareness and self consciousness on every level ( Especially all the times people who know what Thanos is capable of keep attacking him like they think they have a chance, what a joke that is ).There is once again a lot of sub par plastic cinematography with many artificial backdrops, especially in Wakanda. None of it seems particularly natural, and thus the film also has this visually artificial kind of feel that further decreases your immersion ( Although the characters already decreased this pretty far down with their terrible dialogue ). There is no depth or real sub text in the film except perhaps Thanos showing little Gomora his knife balancing which symbolizes his view of a world in balance, but that is pretty much all the cleverness in it. It also has a lot of melodramatic scenes ( Especially with Vision and that redhead woman whose name i forget ) between characters that you cannot relate with, and the only thing that i wanted to see happen was Thanos killing them all, as he was the only individual with even a slightly bit of depth or character, thus making only him, the villain, relatable. Ofcourse as is standard in modern films Infinity War is also very politically correct in that it uses a lot of women warriors fighting like men against eachother in order to negate gender differences like there are none, which further enhances the notion that this is ultimately an irrelevant film.Admittedly the only strength this film might have comes from Thanos's character, and everything else seems irrelevant due to terrible acting & writing. In the end, despite that a lot of characters meet their demise, it still feels as though nothing is really at stake because all the characters are frequently making unfunny jokes & dumb decisions, which in turn leads to the question: 'Why should we care?'","8/10"

That said, i do not understand what is this movie making on the IMDB 250 list (currently at 30th position) - its definitely not that great. You can trow a rock at me if this movie is better then ""Terminator 2"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" - this only shows how many fans this movie and franchise has - not the quality of this product itself.Overall, ""Infinity War"" was a good 2 h 20 min escapism, but it suffers pacing issues here and there.

That is not true and if you're too blind to see that this movie was worse than Age of Ultron, which comparably was pretty bad itself, but this takes the cake and you shouldn't watch, or rate, superhero movies. Don't for a moment think that Avengers: Endgame will be any better. When you write a film so full of plot holes that it may as well have been filmed through a cheese grater, you should not be praised as great directors, or even called writers at that point either.

"Avengers: Endgame","PedroReviews","30 January 2024","Avengers: Infinity War, the culmination of Marvel Studios' decade-long superhero saga, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that defies expectations and delivers an exhilarating and emotionally resonant experience. The film masterfully weaves together a multitude of storylines, bringing together an ensemble of beloved Marvel heroes to confront their most formidable foe yet: Thanos, the ruthless cosmic warlord seeking to restore balance to the universe by wiping out half of all living beings.At the heart of Avengers: Infinity War lies a complex and compelling narrative that explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the delicate balance of fate. The film challenges conventional superhero tropes, questioning the very nature of heroism and the cost of saving the world. Thanos, portrayed with chilling intensity by Josh Brolin, emerges as a formidable villain driven by a twisted sense of righteousness, adding a layer of moral ambiguity to the story.The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing the impressive power and skill of each Avenger. From the intense clash between the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos's Black Order on the planet Titan to the epic showdown in Wakanda, the film delivers a visually stunning and visceral spectacle that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, Avengers: Infinity War excels in its character development, giving each Avenger ample screen time to shine. We witness the growth and evolution of beloved characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, while also introducing new heroes who make their mark, including the brilliant Doctor Strange and the enigmatic Scarlet Witch.The film's emotional impact is profound, as we witness the bonds of friendship and camaraderie forged among the Avengers tested to their limits. The loss of beloved characters is handled with sensitivity and depth, adding a layer of tragedy and realism that makes the stakes feel incredibly high.Avengers: Infinity War's most defining moment, the one that will forever be etched in the minds of MCU fans, is the ending that leaves half of all life in the universe decimated. This shocking and heartbreaking twist serves as a devastating conclusion to the film, leaving the audience reeling with questions and anticipation for the future of the MCU.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","AlsExGal","26 August 2018","Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan? The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (""Stop Thanos""), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.","1/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","radursm","3 May 2018","Not everything that glitters is gold! I'd say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars.
Returning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.
The last ""Avengers"" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.
Yes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine.But the ""Avengers"" franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back.
""Infinity War"" is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It's a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.

It's a jumble, with explosions/death/violence...with little use or reasoning behind it's constant grinding noise. All the tears shed by actors, had no heart behind it. It's sad when money drives a movie rather than writing. Just because something owns Lucas Industrial Light and Magic, doesn't mean it has to be on screen at all times.

"Avengers: Endgame","npfares","6 July 2018","I know a lot of you trolls out there are not going to like this review but whatever. 1. To big of a cast. Had too little screen time to be an effective character (all characters) and fit in the plotline effectively. 2. This ties in to not enough screen time, lack of emotional connection to the characters. I simply didn't care that half of the characters died by the end of the movie. Because we all know that most if not all characters are going to return anyway in future movies, it's a financial decision on Marvel's behalf. We all know that these characters are cash cows for Marvel studios so why care that they died when we all know they are going to come back anyway.... 3. Plotline, it had potential but due to time limits done by the studio and editing team it wasn't fully developed (Yes I understand half of you are going to say 'but I want my movie to be an hour and half and mindless fun'. and to rebut that, you can look this up here on imdb, 90%+ of movies that have made the most money and have the highest ratings are at least 2 and half hours long, most being over 3 hours so don't claim to represent the majority). 4. I would have liked this movie a lot more if they would have split it up into 2 movies, which would have been warranted with the material they were using in the movie. In the end, this movie was the 'might have been' movie. Too many 13 year olds went to see this movie who have never went to see movies before this.","1/10"

Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a clich√©, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...","10/10"

I never read printed materials on infinity war and now after watching this movie I feel if I have the chance to read it, I will.Anyway.. the movie started where one of the most recent Marvel studio movies ended, Thanos is on quest to collect all the infinity stones to proceed with his plan and while doing so he faces opposition attempts by the avengers and others.You will definitely feel shaken by the first scene in this movie and the shock won't wear out by that scene.. Thanos is determined to collect all the infinity stones even the one that is unknown whereabouts to Marvel movies fans to fulfill his aim.. the aim that made his quest to collect infinity stones understood and analyzed. It hold a real nice philosophical thought that really worth all the time to analyze. The visuals were amazing in this movie, specially for Thanos and the new characters. You can read emotions better on the main ""computer constructed"" character, they are very close to the emotions that you may be able to read from human real face. It is a fast based movie with few ""quiet"" scenes and short scenes with slight laughs here and there to lighten the mood. The characters who appear in this movie have varied screen time but it is noticeable even when some characters get longer screen time, they do not overshadow the efforts of other characters that have lesser screen time. The movie is definitely aiming to please group of audience that appreciate certain types of jokes and references. ********** SPOILER Begin**************
There were no introduction to Thano's snap.. by looking back at Thano's reasons to kill people, I never find it connected to the moment where he snapped his fingers.. he snapped as a impulse or reaction to an avenger attack.. his reasons where corrupted by emotions!.. but definitely showing that Thanos would do anything to have this power in his collection. 
********** SPOILER end**************Marvel studios started a huge project with multiple layers and stages that will make it impossible to wrap it as a perfect project.. you will definitely see slips here and there specially when the other Marvel studios productions seemed connected to this movie. At the end I would say that this movie is more suitable to young audience (to me 40 years and younger). Comics started as a ""relief"" and ended to be an ""art"".. This movie is one of the good examples of a nice modern comic movie.","9/10"

Having seen pretty much most the other Avengers franchise and predominantly liking them I thought BP was a deviation from the norm but, I now see with AIW's this might be the new normal.This color by numbers film is probably what the average fanboy would hope for: formulaic plot, a who's who of super characters, an odd and apparently solipsistic villain, a barrage of special effects, machines of destruction and a few melodramatic emotionless bonding moments.The entire two hours and twenty odd minutes ends up being nothing more than a long, boring commercial for the sequel (which will also likely dupe the same crowd of lemmings) into forking over $10, $15, $20? for a ticket. The ""deeper"" interpretations will probably dwell on the conflicted nature of Thanos and his complex subtextual commentary of the state of diminishing resources in their world (hint, they mean our world) and the Orwellian double speak where, when he and his henchmen/women go on their intergalactic killing sprees they pronounce (without irony) that they are not murdering, they are liberating. This is the language of dictators, despots and mass murderers (Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler). His insatiable goal to collect the infinity stones for his special glove/gauntlet will give him ultimate power. How serious is this villain about gaining ultimate power? Well he actually trades away his soul (technically its not his) for the ""soul infinity stone"". Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.In this rendition, our friends from prior Marvel movies seem to be not marvelous at all. This is the foundation for every 8 yr old boys ""fighting argument"" (eg: Who would win if Aquaman fought Spiderman? Or ""who's stronger Hulk, Superman or Batman?) fun and engaging sure, if you're an eight year old boy.But what makes this movie such a mess is exactly the notion of more is better. You could put all your favorite foods together on a plate and one look would make you say, ""Yuck, this is disgusting""But its the weight of expectations, need to generate huge box office, and this kind of ""ultimate hero fantasy"" that makes you feel like ""lets simplify"".","4/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","walentys","3 July 2019","The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for ""comedy"" is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a ""lighter"" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for ""comedy"" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film.Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing ""modern Marvel movies"" as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula.The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place?Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were ""just there"". No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into ""one united Avengers"" character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos.The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it.Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.","1/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","hotjanuary","13 May 2018","Infinity War is a good super hero movie. But I thought Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther were better.Marvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies.
1) if a battle between the Hulk and Thor in Ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat I'm pretty sure Hulk vs Thanos in a spaceship would last one punch.2) Star-lord is just a dude, he does not catch and hold Spider-man.3) If Tony Stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in Iron Man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in Waconda? I'm sure War Machine would have access to activate them.4) If Scarlet Witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near Wakonda why do 2 dudes in Scotland give her a hard time?5) Steve Rogers isn't invulnerable. When swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth he's apparently unharmed after Thor's hammer clears the baddies away. They had time to rip Steve up but didn't?Don't take the easy way out when writing the story. A lot of it was good but some of it was not. Writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief.
1) When an elaborate plan pins Thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he can't DESTROY THE UNIVERSE nobody would stop to talk to Thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe. At the very least you shut up and HELP REMOVE THE GAUNTLET so Thanos can't destroy the UNIVERSE!2) Gamora really thinks Thanos doesn't love her? All that time she was talking about Thanos not loving anyone made no sense. I kept thinking, Gamora, you're being really stupid, everybody knows what's going to happen... maybe you should try running or anything?3) When Thor arrives at Wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump/smash. Banner even feels he has time to stop, open his helmet to say ""You guys are so screwed now!"". But when all the heroes go to protect Vision from Thanos.... Thor arrives AFTER Thanos gets the last stone?I know I'm picking. It's because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and I'd rather not have anymore X-men The Last Stand or Fantastic Four (2015).","2/10"

Other than Black Panther and warriors from Wakanda, but it shows more the often that The Avengers and the Marvel Universe lack diversity and is white privileged. It is yet again white people saving the Universe! Where did we hear that before! Also why does Marvel incorporated Thor, a greek god in their series and not for example the God Krishna from India? Towards the end there were so much of the same going on that you don't feel any empathy anymore of the entire Avengers crews when they died one by one, and you start to think the Universe might aswell be perished, who cares....cant stand the fact that this movies continue to go on and on, and wishing for it to end!

"Avengers: Endgame","glofau","2 May 2018","A movie should stand on its own two feet as an entertainment experience. You shouldn't have to watch 18 other movies first in order to enjoy a film. Unfortunately, to enjoy Avengers: Infinity War, you really have to have seen all the other MCU films or this film doesn't really make any sense. Hell, they rarely even introduce characters by name, let alone give you any clue as to who these people are. It really takes shalllowness to a whole new level of yawn-inducing ennui.It's not like I haven't seen any other Marvel superhero movies; I've seen several. When I was a kid, I read the comic books. And I still had no clue who most of the characters in this movie were! And I certainly didn't give two hoots whether they lived or died.The film is a spectacular, eye-popping kaleidoscope of sumptuous costumes, special effects, and MONEY spent lavishly on just about everything. The salaries for the all-star cast alone must have sucked up a huge portion of the film's budget. But who cares? If you weren't already invested in the characters, you aren't going to become invested in this sea of nameless wisecrackers spewing rather clever (but pointless) dialogue endlessly.I couldn't make it to the end, I walked out about halfway through. I hear the end is the best part but I couldn't summon enough interest to care. They lost me with the meaningless major death early in the picture. Snore! I don't go to a film to see favorite characters bite the dust! Especially since they'll just have to resurrect people so they can make their various contracted sequels in their own franchises. This film is an expensive waste of time unless you're a rabid fan.It's all about the story, man! Without a good story and some time spent up front getting you invested in the main characters, a movie is nothing. Black Panther was terrific because it had a terrific script but this film sucked rocks because its script was a shallow, mediocre snooze despite the witty repartee. Don't bother unless you're a big fan of the MCU.","8/10"

there is no any fight I see from captaion and black panther, just a few punches.
even end was not that good. I thought this movie will be better than first one but now I know first one will always stay best from all.Tony didn't stay in earth and I didn't like it.
action scene were good but not compared to what we saw in civil war.
This is very big movie, there must be some scenes and actions which supposed to be unforgattable. You will also feel at least one time that this isn't movie about avengers or saving earth/universe. its about thanos and gamora story. good time wasted there. No complicated plots. plot holes. no combination of music/sound.

"Avengers: Endgame","RoBiN_SinGH211221","30 September 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","4/10"

Thor and Hulk may not have beaten him, but they should have done more damage. On Thanos' home planet, even though he had multiple infinity stones, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Star Lord, Drax, and Mantis should have taken Thanos down with their collective strengths.And the ending.

"Avengers: Endgame","ssatvaya-16480","19 June 2021","AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...
Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb .....,
Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".","10/10"

Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic clich√© formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and clich√© There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.","10/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","judemcrobbie","20 March 2021","I have basically nothing but praise for Avengers: Infinity War. Considering the rest of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are very safe and don't take many risks or deviate from their generic formula, this does. These movies will go down in cinema history, for better or for worse, and I do truly believe this deserves to be there.
There are plenty of reasons this is the best MCU instalment and one of the better movies of the decade:
The primary reason is the villain, Thanos. He played spectacularly by Josh Brolin, who even in motion capture gets all the acting through. The MCU has had such weak villains throughout so to see Thanos done so well is a great change. I think the genius behind how Thanos is the best villain is because the way the movie cleverly poses the question ""Could he be right?"". This gives him not only a sense of moral righteousness to us but we can truly see the ""No one thinks they're the villain"" philosophy making him so compelling. The opening scene of the movie shows the mad titan effortlessly slaughtering families in his quest to destroy half the population of the universe. He seems completely unfazed by this like he's done it before countless times. There is a clever line of exposition in this after this, not only backing it up that he has (That we will see a flash back showing he's been doing it for at least 20 years) but also how he got the first stone. I like this decision to say rather than show this as it puts us in the action of the people we actually have emotional resonance with, The Asgardians. Throughout this scene we see the two previously strongest characters, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), get not only beat down by Thanos but humiliated. This is especially prevalent in the hulk as we don't see the fight between Thor and Thanos. We do get to see the fight between The Hulk and Thanos however. This is one of the best set pieces in the franchise as not only is it bombastic action but also shows character for both of them, but especially Thanos. Through a mere few counterattacks, Thanos decimates The Hulk. This shows the brains he has, not fighting like the animal The Hulk does, and showing he also has the strength to go toe to toe with the previous strongest avenger. The genius behind the decision to show the brains is that t circles back to when in the final fight he says ""You're not the only one cursed with knowledge"". In this scene we also see the smarts of Thanos, outsmarting the God of Mischief-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He ultimately kills both Loki and Heimdall (Idris Elba), the final remaining people from Thor's previous life before the first Thor and the avengers. I think the next time we see Thanos on screen is in the Knowhere scene. In this he uses his grip over the weapons he has gathered, showing their abilities and his ability over them by cutting through The Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff) with ease and going as far as to turn our beloved Mantis and Drax into Spaghetti and just blocks respectively. There is a lot more in this scene which I could talk about, Peter's arrogance and the Guardians dysfunctional family ultimately leading to their downfall to the hand of a competent villain, but I will elect to talk on the emotional climax of the scene, Peter Quill attempting to kill the love of his life in order to save humanity but getting the rugged pulled out from underneath him. This leaves Peter in a complete state of disarray as if he had killed he would have felt immense guilt for killing the one true love of his life, and if he hadn't then he may have just doomed the universe. No win situations like these are perfect for developing character as we get to see them in difficult situations. This drives Peter and the rest of The Guardians the rest of the movie. There is two more Thanos scenes I would like to would like to talk about: the first of which is the Nebula torture scene. This is a truly perfect scene compared to the many others. Marvel has a tendency to crack jokes unnecessarily, which I'll get into later, but this is just completely devoid of all that humour which is just perfect. The fact Gamora says ""I always hated that chair"" and Thanos deciding to bring himself to the lower level, not feeling the need to assert his dominance over her sets up the next scene perfectly, and then the other thing in this scene is the decision for the 'Mad Titan' no to torture Gamora and instead torturing Nebula, again this makes the next scene perfectly. Then the final scene of the Thanos chat is the Vormir/Soul Stone scene. This scene is just chilling. When Red Skull (Ross Marquand) pronounces that you must give a soul you love for the soul stone, the reactions from both Thanos and Gamora are just amazing. Thanos goes completely silent, null and void he thinks over what he must do. The tear shed shows the pain perfectly set up in the previously alluded scene, but understanding he must do what he must do. In his eyes it means crossing the fate over the universe over his daughter and the only person he ever truly loved. Gamora in this scene is fantastic as well. She originally believes that Thanos doesn't love anyone and therefore he will fail, going as far as to taunt him about it. At the beginning the taunts come thick and fast but they slow down with her voice realising there's only one thing he loves. The climax of Gamora trying to kill herself instead of having to give the stone to Thanos is what makes the scene so great, giving the moral compass of The Guardians and she carries that to her grave ultimately.
Another reason for this being this being the best instalment in the franchise is because of the writing and acting for/from every character:
Iron Man is the man who started all this and Robert Downey Jr. gives a trademark performance. He brings the narcissism and arrogance that comes with the character. He also shows the swagger but more he brings arguably the fourth personality trait of Iron Man's tenure. This iteration brings the most human Iron Man. He has always had obsessions but in this the obsession is with having a child. This is started as far back as Captain America: Civil War (2016) with the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland). In this Spider-Man was easily the youngest superhero, he was still in high school, so Tony Stark saw him as a child, which later became his child of sorts. This is emanated as the same you want to push your child but not to the point of harm, Tony brings Peter Parker into the fight to expand the help for Team Iron Man or whatever it's called, but at the first sign of real danger he tells him to leave. This is carried over to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) where we see Iron Man as the mentor, Uncle Ben figure of the MCU. To those who don't understand that, Uncle Ben in Spider-Man is the man who teaches Peter humility and ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Tony Stark has this trait in this as he teaches Peter not to thrill-seek and do it for the greater cause, what Tony Stark had to learn 9 years prior in the first instalment of the MCU, Iron Man (2008). I say all of this because he gets annoyed at Peter for getting on the spaceship as he is fully aware that it could be a one way trip. The line Peter says ""I can't be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man if there's no neighbourhood"" encapsulates the lessons taught to him in the previous instalments of his character in other MCU movies. Then to see Peter die in his arms has to be the killing blow, comparable to losing a child. Not only does Tony feel this, but because of all the time spent developing their relationship in other movies and this one, we the audience also feel this like the dagger Tony Stark has just been stabbed with, both physically and emotionally. The back and forth between Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Iron Man is brilliant, it evokes the feeling when two of the worlds greatest but heads, like Messi and Ronaldo or Lebron and Curry. The ""I speak for myself"" from Doctor Strange is completely unnecessary and he just affirms Tony Stark's point but it shows however on the same tea, they are very much at each other's throats. This is even more apparent when in the spaceship Tony and Peter save Doctor Strange by blowing a hole and releasing the vacuum. Doctor Strange doesn't thank the pair but proceeds to make an indirect threat to them, saying he will not hesitate to not save them in aid to keep the Time stone. Also another 'alpha' character in Peter Quill joins them on Titan. This throws another problem as he has no willingness to listen to anyone but himself.
Thor is clearly fighting out of vengeance towards Thanos. Though not all by the hand of Thanos, in the last 3 features of Thor he has lost his father-Odin (Anthony Hopkins), his mother-Frigga (Rene Russo), his brother-Loki, and his four of his best friends in Heimdall and the warriors three (Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano). This man has seen everyone die around him so the guilt he must feel is through the roof. This is said by Mantis when trying to empathise with him. He is very much motivated in this by vengeance, it is because of this he is so powerful as he has ""Nothing left to lose"". This gives Thor the reckless abandon needle to take on Thanos alone or take the weight of a star to form his weapon. The will to take the weight, heat and energy of a star shows how much he was connected to Mjolnir. In very much way the the Tardis feels like a person in Doctor Who (1963-Present), Mjolnir had a sense around it that it was more than just a weapon, not just how Thor and it interacted but it's perfect timing and the noise it makes feeling like a language. Speaking of people Thor has lost, Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was destroyed early by Hela (Cate Blanchett). There isn't enough words doc for me to get it all in","4/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","daendil","6 May 2018","Warning: spoilers.There is not much one anticipates from a superhero movie. Spectacle (with lots of CGI), iconic characters, some basic story arc, and saving the world in the end.
Infinity War didn't deliver. And I hate to utter that. I hate to command movies to stay within they genre... But if they don't, there must be reason. There must be good reason. The makers stripped this movie of the most important superhero-flick-features and what remains, just falls apart.First of all, there are way too many characters (could this have been the reason behind the ""end result""?). And then the story arc: it's a downward spiral. The heroes try to stop the villain(s) at multiple locations only to fail one time after another, letting the villain march through with his plan and collect each and every one of the stones. And finally the world is not saved. The end. Cast. Oh, wow. Thank you.Now for the spectacle: that was ok - though most of the fight scenes were too shaky and chaotic for me. I would have preferred less and more detailed scenes, but I don't complain. It a little bit felt like a Japanese anime though, where one combatant pulls a big ass weapon only to have their opponent pull an even bigger ass weapon, and on and on, until one time an entire moon (!) was dropped onto our heroes...For the positives: we did have some good laughs, and the main villain is well detailed (for a superhero movie). Also, Peter Dinklage!Lastly I hate to be blackmailed to watch next episode like this. So no, I will not watch the next one, at least not in the movie theater.","6/10"

I had no idea what was going on and the tedious CGI and probable impossible situations and loud music and interminable explosions made this a tortuous event to sit through.

"Avengers: Endgame","BA_Harrison","28 April 2018","A mean, ugly purple dude scours the universe for the pretty gems that fit into his snazzy metal gauntlet, intent on using the power of the stones for his own nefarious needs. It is up to a team of brave superheroes to try and stop him.I've fallen way behind on my MCU, and am probably not the best person to comment on this latest instalment; or maybe, just maybe, my objectivity makes me more suited than most avid fanboys.For the best part of two hours I was reasonably entertained by what unfolded, despite not knowing the backstory to several of the characters. The plot was pretty easy to pick up, the action scenes were visually impressive, and there was never a lull in pace. It was slick, big-budget popcorn fodder designed to appeal to the masses, but which hardly qualified as revolutionary or indeed, all that memorable. Eventually, I could feel tedium creeping in. And then the last act changed everything...The final√©, in which half the population of the entire universe ceases to exist, makes Avengers: Infinity War a movie that lingers in the mind long after it has ended. Spiderman, gone. Dr. Strange, gone. Black Panther, gone. Groot, gone. And many more besides. Well-established characters vanish in the blink of an eye, and I have to admit feeling a lump in my throat at their casual dismissal. It's a bold move, for sure, and one that will guarantee discussion from all that stay the distance (which reminds me, be sure to remain seated for the now obligatory after credits scene).6/10 for the first two hours or so, but that ending... I'll be generous and add a couple of extra points for Marvel having the balls to go ahead with it.***EDIT*** Having pondered the fate of so many superheroes, I now expect Marvel to bring most of them back to life in the next film via Dr. Strange's powers of time manipulation-not such a ballsy move after all. My rating might be reduced to 7/10 if this is the case.***","10/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","plasticanimalz","15 July 2018","I wasn't going to bother with a review but then I read the first review by blparker that said everyone giving this a bad score were trolls who didn't see the film, then went on to praise it like it was Citizen Kane. I found that rather humorous. My suggestion is to see this in the theatre as the VFX are the only thing it has going for it and won't translate on the small screen. I had no idea this was a 2 hr and 40 min film until I bought the ticket and I seriously contemplated walking into another film because I just did not expect much from this film. When the film started it poorly leapt straight into a scene as if we were in the middle of the movie rather than the beginning. It didn't make a lot of sense other than a set up for on of the long-standing characters to die. Once we moved past this terrible scene it got a little better, which kept me in my seat 'cause the first 10 mins of the film made me want to leave the movie as I was afraid the rest of the film would be like this. It doesn't get much better but at the very least it manages to be entertaining.There is a plot, though, there is very little to it. If you know anything of the Infinity comic, which also was not that great, you know that a lot of characters die. The difference is they killed characters in the comic I cared about and the movies they don't even bother to have those characters, so, whatever. Secret Wars was a much better comic and tells how Spider-Man got his black suit, but it had actual story, so, I guess they didn't want to use a better comic. Infinity truly is one big dude fight. But not even that exciting of action. I thought the Black Panther action was better. I'd read that a bunch of guys don't like Rey from Star Wars because she's a Mary Sue, which I learned means a woman with ultimate, unstoppable powers. Funny, I've never heard a name for guys but they bothered to come up with one for women. Basically, every dude in this film is a Mary Sue. If Thor has the power to resist a star how is it he can't get out of a couple steel girders a wizard wraps around him? How is Captain America always so invincible? He was always kind of a lame character but now he's all-powerful in this universe. Why is Spider-Man suddenly Iron Man? What is the point of Vision, for someone so powerful he doesn't seem to do much other than whine.I did think Dr. Strange was cooler than his own movie in this film. Tony Stark, always likable. Thor was very enjoyable, and I loved his scenes with the Star Jammers. Peter Parker's humor was funny and I liked him better in this film than Homecoming. The best scenes for me were the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Pretty much everything they do is good. The best comedic line was from the bald Black Panther woman, which, unfortunately they didn't show that much of her. In fact, this was a 2 hr 40 min movie with only 2-3 minutes of screen time for the few female characters they've bothered to add to the film Marvel Universe, who are mostly only in the films to make the guys not look gay. The Scarlett Witch seemed to be one of the most powerful characters yet her few scenes were only dedicated to talking about how much she loves Vision and fawning all over this boring robot guy who doesn't seem to have emotion. Yep, a real attractor for women. Black Widow has been lame from the start. A Shield Agent with no powers whom they've given laser guns to, on the team with a bunch of super powered dudes and a god. Lame. There's a long assortment of Marvel super power females they could have added to Avengers but they literally just added someone to look hot. It really annoyed me how underused all the female characters were in this film. Black Panther's sister was the star of the Black Panther film and she has no purpose in the Avenger film other than to cut out Vision's stone. She's basically an extra.I've never kept much up on Thanos 'cause he's a relatively boring character who wasn't very often used in the Marvel universe for the 10 years I read Marvel comics. I think he was more of a Silver Surfer or Rom villain...which, did anyone actually read those? I thought the idea that balance is used as bad and evil was a bad message. What is he now, an eco-terrorist? He didn't seem so much crazy as a Green Peace dude with too much power. Thanos chose people at random so he wasn't a racist, a bigot, or anything else, he was by the films portrayal an environmentalist. Humans thin out animals when they ravage the terrain. How is it different? I go to films to be entertained, not have these poorly plotted out existentialism by stoners moments. In the past 6 months, Infinity War, Jurassic World, and The Last Jedi all had these nihilist themes or moments where they are trying to express some weak, childish form of morality but it is actually anti-heoric, selfish, immoral, or just lame.I, in some way applaud the writers for making the film mildly entertaining despite the amount of characters they were working with. That is a challenge. But, overall there wasn't much story going on or actual emotion so I really didn't care when they killed off a good chunk of the heroes. All I could think was, ""Oh, his contract is up, so they're killing him off. They didn't use her anyway, so, of course she's dead. Oh, well, he's a new actor every 2 or 3 movies, so, no surprise."" Didn't care. The entire film was fairly unmemorable and my life could have continued just fine without seeing it.","9/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","jtindahouse","2 May 2018","There are some films that simply can not be reviewed without going into spoilers. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' is one of them, so fair warning. I watch roughly 150 films each year and yet this is the first MCU movie I have seen. Not a single one of them up until now appealed to me. What finally got me along to see this one? Well the fact that it is currently sitting in the top 10 of the IMDb Top 250 had a little to do with it. I had to see what all the fuss was about. There are some truly tremendous and groundbreaking films in that list and the top 10 in particular holds some of the greatest films ever made. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' has no business being there.There are a lot of characters in this movie to keep up with and it is frankly exhausting at times. Admittedly, the film actually does a pretty god job of balancing everyone and giving them sufficient screen time and a purpose for being in the movie. There are so many characters though and so many story arcs that it can become a little frustrating waiting for the good ones to role around again. What I've learnt is that there are some incredibly strong characters in this universe ('Iron Man' was the stand-out for me) and some phenomenally weak characters too ('Captain America' probably being the weakest from what I could ascertain). The strongest thing the movie has going for it is the character of 'Thanos'. A genuinely intimidating, menacing and threatening villain is always the key to any superhero movie being good. Josh Brolin plays him brilliantly (as he always does) and this film owes a lot to that character alone.Now let's get into those spoilers by talking about the ending. Basically 'Thanos' wins and with the click of his fingers kills half the universe. We then see roughly half of the superheroes crumble into nothing and ""die"" (supposedly). I suspect this has a lot to do with the film having such a high IMDb rating. It turns out people love an ending where the bad guys win. That makes me happy, because it doesn't happen anywhere near enough in Hollywood today. My problem with the ending though is this. If you really think those characters are dead, never to be seen again, then you are sorely mistaken. So in that sense it is incredibly cheap. I hate movies (universes) where a character dying doesn't actually mean they're dead (DC is just as guilty of this sadly). As if this isn't obvious enough to 90% of people, the film actually reminds of you of this fact not 5 minutes prior when a character is killed only for 'Thanus' to go back a few moments in time and thus bring him back to life.Enjoy this film for what it is. It's a great looking flick, with some excellent action sequences, funny one-liners and a menacing villain with a clear and simple plot that is easy to follow. It's done well no one could deny that, but don't try and claim that is something truly great and worthy of the IMDb top 10 because that is simply not the case.","8/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","yaszi-83296","10 November 2021","This is the movie! A decade of build up for this, and it was really good! The movie is just 2. Hours and 30. Minutes of pure action, people that were fans, were not fans or think they are fans watched this movie around the whole world, their are groups of characters that fight for the same thing and as the movie goes on, more and more characters group together until there is only pretty much 1 big group of heroes. This movie is unique because the heroes aren't the protagonist, it's kinda the amazing villain Thanos, he is emotionally driven and his story is great, he is kinda a hero, he thinks wiping out half the universe is necessary to safe the universe from problems caused by overpopulation, he knows it is crazy and solving a problem means trying not to hurt anyone but he believes he has to do it! He is constantly getting hammered by the heroes and you kinda feel bad for him, there is no villain. This is why he is a great villain, he is not trying to be a menace out to blow the world, he is trying to do his part and save it.Another thing I love is that anyone can watch it, anyone can enjoy it even do they don't care about marvel, the MCU works in a way that someone only has to watch some movies to understand that there is a connection with these stones, and someone going after all of them is a big deal! The movie is it's own think and is pure fun superhero action, it is great and truly has a infinite amount of fun.The movie is a must watch and is the big event in a way, it is kinda the first part and the second being Avengers Endgame, both movies are their one story at the same time as being a part of this now over a decade long franchise.

"Avengers: Endgame","nogodnomasters","5 May 2018","This is an easy film to spoil, so I will keep it brief. Thanos (Josh Brolin) gathers a group of bad guys with the quest of obtaining all the infinity stones. His goal is to save the universe by killing off half of its life with the snap of a finger...and enjoy the sunset. The film combines all the Marvel characters available to do a film to fight the villains and Stan Lee to play a bus driver. The feature assumes you have seen all the other films as there is zero introduction of character, and hopes you have forgotten a few minor details that conflict with the current film. The film is generally darker than previous films, but still has the humor. I wished Star Lord had discovered a new tape whereby he could defeat Thanos. Not thrilled with the plot or ending. The production works with 3 subplots for much of the feature. The ending...well we know what happens next with a go back in time and let's hose this series up like they did X-Men.","9/10"

Each stone quest involves 10 minutes or so of the same CGI fighting. Why 5 stones? Why not, they've got time to fill. Lots and lots of time. Many of the characters are likeable esp the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Hulk and Tony Stark BUT, there are just too many groups involved with too much repetition. The plot is mildly interesting daring to touch on overpopulation crisis. Thanos makes a good point. Though in true Hollywood style, he goes about it the wrong way.

"Avengers: Endgame","l-r-patrick","2 May 2018","Firstly, special effects were really good, cast was also very good! I grew up reading these comics and Thanos along with Doctor Doom were my two favorite bad guys!
Thanos is very good in this film, it's just the writers obviously don't know the comics very, or just think they are better than the likes of Stan Lee and Jim Starlin who
was the person that created Thanos. Thanos kills to please Lady Death, he does not kill just because he thinks there's to many people, what a stupid idea that was.
I mean if he is worried about there not being enough resources for the population, once he has the infinity gauntlet, he can solve that by creating enough resources for
everyone! It would have been so simple to have Thanos worshipping Lady Death, her just silently watching, and him, as in the comics trying to gain her attention by 
killing to please her, but that was to complicated for the writers to put in, as audiences would not know who she was, lol. Self explained by Thanos, easily done, 
we've not seen the dwarf before, but he magically appeared, I mean, that was another waste of a whole sequence, Thor trying to get a hammer made (Beta Ray Bills 
hammer btw), I mean WTF, just have his proper hammer rejuvinate and hold the power, oh yeah, these writers wanted to change that part of the story as well.
These writers need to know, Stan, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko etc etc wrote and created these characters and they should stick to the original elements that made them
what they are today. They think they can come along and rewrite these stories in their vision, just like JJ Abrahams with Star Wars and Star Trek, they think they are
better than the original creators which they are not by any means!For me it's getting to the point where I don't really care if I see these films anymore, they just let me down every time, where these writers don't do the proper research
and just create it in their own way. The comic fans made the comics a success, without us over the years, there would be no films, so maybe you should try to please the
fans before the random cinema goers?Bits that really annoy me, no Lady Death or any celestial power beings of any kind, Red skull appears on the planet galaxies away to Thanos about the sould gem, great writing
there, true to the comics, NOT! Boy that sucked, I thought, why is this not at least Mephisto here or Lady Death, Red Skull, it's so bad I want to cry.
The Hulk was not really in the film, just the first few minutes, they just wanted to give the actor face time, so just had him jumping around in the Hulk buster outfit, yawn!This film is an insult to The Infinity Gauntlet Comics, go and read Thanos Quest, then The Infinity Gauntlet 1-6 and wait for this on normal TV.Totally ruined one of my favorite story lines, these writers need to get over themselves and not write it as if they think it's their creation, it's not!Best bit in the film for me, was Stan Lee's cameo!5/10 but should have been an easy 10.","6/10"

I could go on and on but 10/10 says enough.","3/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","milleniumlogan","3 May 2018","This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans. The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. 
Star-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy. Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot. Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene. Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense. Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie. Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth. Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU.","3/10"

It drives me nuts anymore, when fighting takes a 5 minute 'time out' for a lame, ""poignant"" dialog scene. I guess that I've seen too many of these to enjoy them anymore.","3/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","searchingfortao","27 April 2018","I've watched every MCU movie at least twice. I love them all, even Iron Man 2, but this was terribly disappointing. This whole thing gave me the impression that the writers watched a lot of Game of Thrones and thought: ""I know what people like, let's kill a bunch of heroes!"" Even if the fight scenes devolved to the absurd, it didn't matter, we had good guys dying, so this would be a win.Now obviously it's a comic book movie, so it's a safe bet that most if not all of the heros they killed will somehow miraculously be resurrected, but that's not the point. I just paid ¬£12 to watch characters I fell in love with get murdered for 2 hours only to have it wrap up with half of everyone dying. Now I get to wait an entire year to find out how they're going to fix it.If I wanted to get punched in the stomach, I'm sure I could find someone to do it for less than ¬£12 and 2 hours of my time.","4/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","TK32","28 April 2018","I love all the Marvel movies - well, until now. It doesn't seem that the movie ends so much as two-thirds of the way in the writers got bored and said ""let's just phone in a bunch of failures and quit. Note: bad guy winning doesn't automatically make dramatic tension. And you can't just write the characters acting stupid to make them lose. If you'd done your job, there could have been legitimate reasons for failure, not just you writing ""even though their lives are at stake and they are seconds away from getting off Thanos's glove, let's have Chris's Pratt say 'No! I will not hold on one second and beat on him after you get the glove off, I will do it now!' because darn it, it's too tough to expect us to come up with a good reason they fail."" How about having some of Thanos's followers show up and prevent it? There are so many other problems with the last third, I swear it was written completely separate from the rest. AnAndd what about a simple ""The battle continues in..."" All in all, skip this one and wait for the next.","3/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","tfminfl","13 January 2019","303. Avengers: Infinity War. Heres what I get... There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Droid army Vs the Naboo... only now it was Thermos' computer viruses Vs Wakanda... you're sayin that wasn't intentional? Filmbufftim on FB.","8/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","TheMovieDoctorful","14 November 2018","No matter what people think about me or my opinions, I wanted to like this film more than anyone. I love superheroes, I love Marvel and as much as I criticize the MCU for being safe and formulaic, there are several Marvel Cinematic Universe films that I've loved (The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the first 2 Captain America movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther to name the big ones). And I love that this movie enthralled and captivated many of my friends, a good number of them calling this one of their favorite movies of all time. However, the truth of the matter is that Avengers: Infinity War disappointed me. It deeply let me down. It's not an absolute failure and I certainly wouldn't call it irredeemable, but I can't say I find it to be a good film either.In terms of positives, the first one to come to mind would obviously be the jolly, purple giant himself, Thanos. He's undoubtedly one of the most interesting and developed villains in the MCU to date and he's acted phenomenally by Josh Brolin. I commend the creative team for keeping Thanos utterly despicable and villainous while still making him a compelling enough lead for us to be invested in his dark mirror of the Hero's Journey. It's fascinating to see an arc like this, full of sacrifice, struggle and personal loss concluding in an ultimate triumph, be translated to a villain without losing any of the qualities that keep him monstrous. He is a fully rounded, fully realized, human character; just not one who's a good person.As someone who hated Tom Holland's Spider-Man in both Civil War and Homecoming, I actually liked his performance and characterization here. The high stakes consequences of the story allow Holland to go to emotional places he simply wasn't allowed to before and his relationship with Tony Stark carries much more emotional weight, relatability and humanity to it than either of his previous two films. Maybe there's hope for this Spider-Man after all.Most (Keyword; most) of the content regarding the Guardians of the Galaxy is done wonderfully. Dave Bautista's Drax and Pom Klementieff's Mantis act wonderfully off of all the Avengers they get to interact with and it's nice to see that MCU teamup movies have moved and matured beyond thinking that every teamup movie needs all the team members to hate each other and fight over nonsense for 2 acts. Chris Pratt's performance as Starlord is truly heartbreaking and I commend the team behind Infinity War to have the guts to painfully strip away everything this character ever loved. For all my problems with the film, Starlord's emotional breakdown at Thanos after learning of Gamora's death is actually a major highlight of the movie for me. It's a deeply human and relatable moment that Pratt acts with such intensity and power.I also found myself really invested in the love story of Vision and Wanda. Elizabeth Olsen and Kevin Bettany have beautiful chemistry and their calm, soft moments before the storm bring a real gentleness and quiet beauty to the film. Scarlet Witch being forced to kill the only man she ever loved to save half the universe was by far the most emotionally powered moment of the movie and it's such a shame these two got so little screentime.That's the biggest problem of the film for me. Characters getting little screentime. Infinity War is deeply overstuffed, it has characters by the dozens and no idea what to do with a good half of them. Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Black Panther, the Hulk; all of these characters (As well as the side characters they're associated with) could be completely removed from the film and nothing would change. And yet, I'm supposed to feel the epic weight of their massive battle with the army of Thanos despite their importance to the story being minimal at best and non-existent at worst?The ending felt cheap to me rather than dramatic and emotional. The only deaths to really affect me were Vision and Spider-Man. The rest (Minus Gamora, whose death is too awkwardly edited and weirdly toned down from a violence standpoint to affect me until Starlord's reaction, and Loki, who has been seemingly killed and brought back to life so many times that I hardly buy he's finally dead) die with little to no reaction from their friends and comrades when that's exactly what we needed. We don't get to see Rogers react to losing both of his closest friends or the rest of the Guardians all dying together. It's all such blatant sequel baiting, especially with many of the characters (Including Loki) already having future MCU films or TV shows announced. Gee, I guess they're all just going to center on piles of sand, huh? This kind of sequel baiting conclusion is hardly ""new"" or ""bold"" or ""inventive."" In fact, it's pretty much what the MCU already did with Captain America: Civil War.Speaking of, as much as people want to give Guardians Vol. 2 crap for not balancing the comedy and drama well, where were your criticisms here? Towards a movie that starts making pop culture reference jokes almost immediately after Gamora's death, hardly even giving us a moment of mourning or reflection? A movie that hardly ever gives us a moment for pause for Thor to mourn Loki? I'm sure there was ambition in here somewhere, but in the end, everything got overpowered by the Marvel formula and tone for me.No, Infinity War isn't terrible, but I simply think it bit off more than it could chew. However, everything is set up for Part II to blow me away. I'm still holding out hope for this stage of the MCU to end in a high note for me.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","hp-33729","6 August 2018","I'm not really a Marvel fan, but I did enjoy some of their movies and like some of their characters. Apparently this movie is a culmination of all the previous storylines in the Marvel universe, so this time they made sure to _really_ go over the top with it to please the fans. All your favorite characters are there doing their own thing to fight against the main villain in an end game that feels like it's 7 hours long. With so many characters and so many parallel storylines I found it hard to focus or care about anything and just tuned out, like when you're watching a very long battle in a Transformers movie that has no consequences whatsoever and the movie loses you and you start to ask yourself why you're not doing anything useful with your life instead of watching that nonsense.It's probably just me as I'm not really interested in this universe in general and the main villain is kind of disappointing in my opinion, but be warned, if you're not a die hard fan either, you will probably be bored to death just like me.","4/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","s3276169","30 July 2018","The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel. This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh. The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks ""all the same"". On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer. That said this film is what it is. I've seen it all before and I'd be hard pressed to want to see it all again. 5/10 from me.","1/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","haydenluz","13 August 2020","Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","ryfin","8 November 2021","I adore this movie, and it is by far my favorite MCU movie. Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","bora_mustafa","28 April 2018","I was really excited to watch this third Avengers movie, being that they were going all in with both the Avengers and the Guardian characters but ultimately the movie is just one big mess of a movie. The movie is more of a Thanos story which is fine as we need to know as much about this Titan, however the rest just didn't measure up.I understand getting some 30 characters together in one movie was always going to be a stretch, but I really didn't enjoy the movie. I won't delve into the plot as many reviewers have done so, I will just say that some of the action sequences were pretty good especially from Iron Man and Dr Strange, but ultimately the ending really agitated me and yes, we all know there will be another movie soon to complete this story but it just felt like a setup movie.Not as epic as everyone is making it out to be. I still rather watch the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier and even Ragnarok over this any day.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","hello-181-893413","30 April 2018","Maybe I'm just getting massive franchise fatigue but I found the moving totally borIng. The story is linear, the stakes don't seem real by foreshadowIng the fact that they can change the past, and there's a LOT of backstory they fill in to get you up to speed on all 500 marvel super hero's from their various franchises that it's hard to feel emotionally engage. The power balance between characters strength and weaknesses seemed flawed. One character would be in peril from X weapon in one scene but then beat a more powerful weapon Y in another scene. Movies attain suspension of disbelief by setting and following rules. These rules seemed sloppily applied but all in all it wasn't as bad as Venom...","9/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","FabledGentleman","25 April 2018","MAJOR SPOILERS!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!My headline is the easy way to describe this movie. It is grand, majestic and spectacular. Just like Thanos towering everyone else with his physique this movie also stands above everything else, at least most of it. Because wow, this movie is really something to behold. Marvel went all in with everything here, the cgi is phenomenal, the acting is great, the story is well told, the pacing is near perfect. I have seen this movie twice in IMAX 3D and once in 4DX now, and i have never seen a movie with better image quality than this one, never.Ever since the MCU started with Iron Man i have seen every film released, most of them are good, some are outright great, a few are mediocre and very few are bad. But for the most part it has been a hell of a ride, and I've eagerly been awaiting this movie for quite some time, we all knew that it would come down to this, but were you prepared for what would be the outcome? Not many were, though many of us knew several avengers and other major characters would die in this film, i did not expect it to be this many.This movie truly didn't waste any time getting down to business, as before ten minutes had passed, Heimdall and Loki are killed, and we see the Titan kick the crap out of Hulk, this set the tone for the entire movie right of the bat, and was IMO a smart move, now we knew for sure what a badass Thanos is, and this was before he got all the stones.What the Russo brothers have done here is to overdo themselves. Winter Soldier and Civil War are two of the best MCU movies to date, and you got to wonder how Marvel found these guys, and knew what they were capable of, because Infinity War just lifted the bar even higher. This movie is sort of Michael Bay's wet dream, this is what he wants to achieve, but never can because he has no idea how to tell a story or handle emotions. This movie is a 2 hour and 30 minute spectacle, which has action scene after action scene lined up, and it never feels too much, somehow they managed to balance it, and that is a feat not many directors can pull off.But also the music is masterfully composed, and fit every scene perfectly. And the costumes and props design are state of the art, everything looks and feels so right in this film, all the people involved has done an outstanding job.And i really have to give it to Josh Brolin. Thanos is easily the best villain i have seen in quite some time. He is a complex villain, that is so well portrayed i almost start rooting for him, and that is saying something come to think how many years i have grown to love the avengers and the guardians. This is also big thanks to the amazing cgi that just brings so much life into the character. I can understand his motivations, i can side with his thoughts, i both agree and i disagree at same time. Such a great character, easily the best MCU villain so far, and i had Loki as my favorite before him.At the end when Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Scarlett Witch, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Black Panther, Mantis, Bucky Barnes and many others are killed because he gets all the stones, i both felt a sense of pride for Thanos completing his mission, he truly is a determined badass. But at the same time i felt great sadness that so many of the characters that i loved, are dead.But MCU has killed characters before, which has been brought back to life, so i guess that will be the case here as well, as the next movie most likely will deal with time travel and fight Thanos in the future and the past. Dr.Strange gave up the time stone because of the 14.000.605 outcomes that he saw, only one lead to victory for the avengers, and giving up the stone was the beginning of the victory path. So even though this movie ended on a cliffhanger, it left enough hints that will be talked about for a whole year, and it will build the biggest hype in the history of cinema. So at the end of the day, this movie just delivers on so many levels, and it will make way for the rise of many new characters to enter the MCU, and finally take down Thanos and undo some of the damage he has done.It's quite amazing that this movie actually managed to live up to the hype, that should not even be possible when you think about it, but it did. The movie is absolutely amazing.I can't wait for Avengers 4.","1/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","brunovanael","21 January 2019","Jurassic Park, The Sixth Sense, Alien, Harry Potter and The Hangover are great movies. Putting all characters, realities and styles of these movies into one would probably result in a hidious thing, and that's what's wrong with this Avenger movie. There's too much of everything. More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.","2/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","tommy5677","29 September 2018","That's what you enter the theater with. Especially when you're going to see a Marvel movie. In this case not a single one was met. By the middle of the movie I found myself asking, where is it going and when is it going to get there.Three quarters in I found myself realizing it needed to be over. Every scene became a drag because that's what they did. On and on, one after another, with no endpoint. It was like the writer had a vision and then went blind.A simple plot that was easy to follow but it never seemed to develop. And you would think that in 2 1/2 hours you might get to know your characters a little. There was so much constant action and CGI, there was little or no time for that.If you enjoy being on the edge of your seat the entire time, this movie will do it for you because the action is never ending. A shining example of overdone CGI, lots of violence, and not enough time to tell if anyone can actually act.All of this nonsense to be left in the end with an incredible sense of loss. When I go to a superhero movie I want the superhero to win. In this case, The Avengers are nothing but a bunch of losers. And then there was the End Credits. They were giving credit to employees of the studios, like the CEO of Disney. WTF! This went on ad nauseum just like the movie itself. Don't waste your time waiting for the scene at the end, you'd be better off leaving the theater before the credits start to roll. 
In my opinion, this movie is an abysmal failure. Don't waste your 13 bucks on such trash.","2/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","warren-87235","20 September 2018","Having missed this at the cinema, my other half and I finally got round to buying and watching it (in 3D). Wow... what a mess. I'm glad we didn't pay to see this at the cinema. I'm quite honestly amazed at how many good reviews it's been getting. It's disturbingly close to 'Last Jedi' level bad (but not quite... that would still take some work). There's no real plot to speak of, things just seem to happen 'because', any sense of logic or consistency goes out the window (And that's in comparison to most of the other Marvel movies, which are hardly that great in the logic stakes in the first place!), power levels constantly change to fit a particular scene, rather than match what has been established for characters previously, etc., etc..... To top it all off, after all the build up, Thanos turns out to be one of the least interesting Marvel villains, with face-palm-inducing 'woke' motivation. The only good thing I'll say, is that it manages what most Marvel movies usually manage: the character interaction and banter is fun for the most part, and amusing. Oh, and most of the effects are good (except for Banner pointlessly in the Hulk-buster).I understand and applaud the desire to try an 'Empire Strikes Back', but there are a few big differences (A story, for one). Empire works so well because our heroes get their posteriors kicked. They struggle tooth and nail to survive, and even when they do get a chance to fight they are soundly defeated. Infinity War falls flat, because the villain and his forces never feel particularly strong, and our heroes get repeated opportunities to defeat Thanos and simply don't take them because it would end the film early.To be honest, despite its very obvious flaws (and a certain top lip deserving second billing), I actually found Justice League more enjoyable. I genuinely began falling asleep at the end of Inifinity War and closed my eyes, just listening till the end, I was so bored. Such a shame and a wasted opportunity after the build up of so many movies.","10/10"

The ending is surprising, especially for an American movie, but besides this the movie neither offers scenography comparable with Star Wars or Avatar nor any unique special effects.There is no consistency in action, power distribution or whatsoever. One minute the same character can die from a fist hit, the other he survives an explosion of the whole planet. Once he travels the space barefoot, the other he dies from being sucked from the ship. The colorful light goes back and forth but the evil character doesnt use any of his powers most of the time just to prolong the boring fights.Watching this movie is just distubring and frustrating.","10/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","tyrantlizardthad","19 August 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film so powerful and good that instead of being crushed by the weight of its expectations, it lifted them up and launched them out into space. Packed with epic, intense action, fantastic character work, and a powerful ending, it doesn't get much better then this. It's especially remarkable when you remember just how much buildup there was to this film and how massive the expectations were, you would think it would be almost impossible to meet, but Infinity War does it so well it makes it look easy.The story is exhilarating, it moves at a brisk pace which really makes you feel the immense stakes and how urgent the situation is. Every single character is handled extremely well and are all in character. The film makes sure to pay attention to what spot they're in in their character journey since the last film each respective character was in and continues their development. It maintains continuity and brings every character together in a way that's organic and serves the story perfectly. Tony Stark finally gets to fight the thing he has been tormented by and preparing for years to fight, Steve Rogers and most of the other Avengers are fugitives of the law and thus are more rugged, Bruce Banner is still dealing with his conflict with the Hulk (continuing what was established Thor: Ragnarok), Thor is dealing with the grief of losing everything, manifesting in personal vengeance towards Thanos, and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the characterization of Thanos, one of the best villains in cinema since Darth Vader from Star Wars (which was the intent of the Russos, specifically saying that the wanted to make ""the next Darth Vader""). He is a ruthless, insane and narcissistic monster, but he still has honorable traits, respects his enemies, he has a very flawed perspective of how to save the universe but believes it whole-heartedly, and even a fatherly love towards Gamora. He's terrifying but also humanized, and it just works perfectly.The computer generated effects, especially those that brought Thanos to life, are perfect, as is the soundtrack. While MCU scores are typically regarded as forgettable, Alan Silvestri's score for Infinity War is anything but. The performances are impeccable as well, there's not a single unsatisfying or uneven performance. Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Benedict Bumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Zoe Salanda as Gamora in particular stick out to me and knock it out of the park.In conclusion, Infinity War is the best MCU film and one of the best films to have come out in the past 10 years, and I don't think you could ask for more. Infinity War (along with its sequel, Avengers: Endgame) isn't just a movie, it's an experience.","5/10"

First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.","3/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","pink_floydilia","10 February 2019","So to preface this review, let me start by saying I'm a massive Marvel fan. I've lived, breathed, written and read Marvel since I was eight years old.
The Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie. And to the masses, it was good. So hats off to them for making a crowd pleasing movie. But to the others who like some sense and substance when they pay good money to see a movie, try harder.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Mr-Fusion","29 April 2018","High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, ""Infinity War"" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color. But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result. If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly. I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction. And that's about it.6/10","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","comolgab","12 January 2019","Superheros are super because they do amazing things compared to the rest of us in this world. Here however, everyone does amazing things, always, for too long. It becomes boring. There is no normal world in the background to provide the contrast, it is one (long) fantasy tale. They're all ""super"" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still ""clunky"" and ""solid"". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character. Of course the movie is visually striking, but again, from the first scene to the last: I got used to the visuals after about 20 minutes, the rest felt to me like repetition.","3/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","zvezdochkapetrova","2 September 2018","Yep, you heard me....Just don't. 
If you love these characters, were hooked on the previous movies, *don't.*
If you deal with anxiety, panic, depression, or anything else, *don't.*
This movie is not like the others, and honestly, does not show much screen time for most the characters.
It is much more violent and emotional than the previous films, but more than that, it is extremely disturbing.
Basically, if you feel obligated to view it for your favorite characters, just beware, there's not much screen time for them, so don't push yourself, or feel like you have to do it.
Also, I would definitely NOT take kids to see this, as the movie has a very dark and disturbing atmosphere to it.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","danmossman","12 July 2022","This film achieves absolutely everything it aims to. All the heroes show their motivations and interact well with eachother, from where they were all left by individual films.

"Avengers: Endgame","olgavalentovaov","30 April 2018","This movie has certainly made history. A film that has so much going on and still manages to be boring just has to be some sort of a record. I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there).
Also, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot.
And to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay. We don't need another character up in here, we really don't. And especially not Carl Manvers.
Not worth the cash, not worth the hype, not worth another word.","7/10"

I got goosebumps, I cried, I laughed, I got excited, I had anxiety, I was nervous, I was angry, I was happy. This movie will definitely give you whiplash in the emotion department. But it is by far the best avenger movie to date! And considering that it's their last one, I'm happy about that. But I'm extremely sad that this is the end of this MCU universe and I will miss all of them so very very much. At least we still have Thor, who should be appearing in the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie.","10/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","mistramicizia","29 June 2018","Before I bought the tickets for this, I was amazed, to say the least, by the high ratings at this site. Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some ""plot holes"" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers","1/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","25 April 2018","**Mild spoilers ahead**Avengers: Infinity War culminates 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU)'s world-building and makes a TREMENDOUS pay-off in this two-and-a-half hour action adventure epic that is part swashbuckler and part space-opera. The Russo Brothers deliver the screenplay of a lifetime from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely; and boy the two duos that have single-handedly shaped the MCU into what it is today. They direct a star-studded cast featuring the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Peter Dinklage, Benedict Cumberbatch, Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper, Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo. That's only PART of the ensemble cast this film has to offer. And the story; my god the story and scale of this movie: IT'S INCREDIBLE; and it's basically a full-fledged space opera now!For those of you who aren't ardent superhero nuts but passively love Spider-Man all the same (like I do), get this: SPIDER-MAN IS IN SPACE! From the ambitious union of characters built around 10 years of multi-billion-dollar filmmaking culminates in one of the ultimate cinematic experiences your hard-earned money can buy and be considered a well-earned investment all-round. Witty quips, Beatles references, a Flash Gordon quip from Peter Quill, it's just a great-great time at the movies.Infinity War is a space-opera with superheroes; and it's comparable to the likes of The Star Wars Trilogy, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and, (heck, maybe even) The Dark Knight Trilogy.

Not to talk about stupid character decisions that completely change the plot...It takes away from the soul of the story which becomes simple, forced and artificial.SPOILER:Just one example for abilities (but the movie is full of it): in one scene Thanos beats the pulp out of Hulk, but in the rest of the movie all the other heroes receive punches from him like it's nothing.And one example of stupidity: Quill becomes responsible for the grim ending by saving Thanos in the last second, as Thanos was on the verge of being stripped of its powers.I expected more...","10/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","oliverdimitri","26 April 2018","Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.","3/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","nicar127","13 May 2018","Kill kill kill. Death. That's what this movie is about. To their credit, the actors in this film were all great, despite each being given minimal screen time, with near zero character development. There are just too many characters and angles, each with the same ultimatum: KILL. (They are all trying to kill the villain Thanos, of course, but it's still Kill Kill Kill!)I never felt any passion for any of them until Gamora was thrown to her death by her POS step dad Thanos. When we see movies we want to feel the passion of the characters we are watching. None existed until this moment. My favorite character in this film is Peter Quill. Way to go Chris Pratt. He brought depth and passion, sorrow and love, to his role. He is the stand out in this film. I cried when he cried. I was pissed off when he was pissed off. Peter Quill / Star Lord was the sole representative of human emotion in this film. And he did it well.On the technical note, Thanos just looks like a cartoon character.
(No offense, Josh Brolin, you were GREAT as Thanos!!)
CGI always looks fake. I watched the entire movie imagining the ""green screen"" behind all of them. In a few years, actors won't be needed at all.Iron Man could have just gotten a huge eraser to erase Thanos The Cartoon.

"Avengers: Endgame","dezsokekovacs","28 April 2018","If you like to watch for 2.5 hours how your heroes get beaten and even killed then this movie is for you, otherwise it will not entertain you. 
At the beginning Thanos has only one Infinity Stone but at the end he has all the stones and therefore he snap his fingers, half of the population dies (Avengers included) and ... THE END!
This means that there are 5 fights for the 5 stones and Thanos wins all the fights by beating and/or killing the Avengers.All MCU movies structures are the same. They are split in 2 parts: in the first half the heroes get beaten and the villain wins all, but when all hope is gone it start the second half when the heroes recover from their wounds and they win (almost every time) with a big ""idiotic"" bam.
The Avengers: Infinity War is the first half. I think it will be entertaining to watch it when the Avengers 4 will come out (just like The fellowship of the ring + The two tower). It's very likely that in Avengers 4 they will use the time stone to reverse the time to resurrect the dead Avengers. Or maybe another stone (honestly I don't really know what they can do) but the resurrection is for sure.Bottom line: this movie is watchable if you see it only once. But to watch several times how your heroes get killed means that you need therapy.PS: When Dr. Strange looked into the future to find a positive solution, he found only ONE from millions of possibilities and they didn't used it. Why? Or they used it but Strange didn't saw in the future that Peter Quill is coming?","10/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","adeckofcards","25 July 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.
In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.
It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.
'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","1/10"

So many died but i don't know why this film was in a rush and that's why their death didn't made me feel bad for them. They should have increased the runtime of the film. One of the worst thing is characters were not balanced. Captain america hardly had any dialogue. Hulk was shown only for 30 seconds in the entire film. There were many ways to stop thanos but hey he should look badass so let's make heroes dumb. Cgi was okay but in many places it looked cartoon-ish.

"Avengers: Endgame","Shakor77","18 July 2018","To a certain degree most super hero movies are pointless as they are mainly about beings with super powers and in flamboyant costumes duking it out at each other. And, seeing as I grew up reading super-hero comics, that is just fine.However, without getting into any spoilers, this movie could have ended the first minute as the end-result would have been the same as watching the whole thing for 2+ hours. So I guess you could say that this game was a setup for the next Avengers movie, which seems to have become the norm these days.But disregarding that, there are a number of other weak points in this movie such as:Hulk was a massive disappointment and made his weakest contribution so far of any Avengers movie. And it was never explained why.Vision was another disappointment as apparently the Black Widow, who has no super powers, could hold her own against someone who was mopping the floor with Vision.Some young girl in Wakanda, who I never heard of in the comics, is apparently more intelligent than both Bruce Banner and Tony Stark as she came up with a solution, in about 5 minutes after been presented with the problem, that those other two hyper-intelligent people could not come up with. I suppose that is because of feminism?Loki made a very uncharacteristic choice which quickly made him irrelevant in this movie. Why then even have him in the movie to begin with?Dr Strange, who was pretty good in the movie, didn't seem to stand much of a chance against a Thanos henchman but apparently could go toe to toe with Thanos himself?Thor was easily swept aside by Thanos, in the beginning, yet by the end seemed to be the only one who could actually defeat Thanos, just because he had a weapon. Yet in Thor: Ragnarok Odin suggested that Thor, was more powerful than Odin and did not need any weapons as he said: Are you Thor: son of Hammers? I could go on and on but this is basically a very nice action movie with some great performances from actors such as Josh Brolin as Thanos. But don't think too deeply about it as it is just an action movie and not much more.","10/10"

In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.","1/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","three_dead_crows","5 May 2018","In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. 
 
The day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel. After watching this movie I feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure Peter Quill is, just like they did with Danny Rand in the defenders.","1/10"

Epic, you would say...One would say: Why Thanos did nothing to conquer the universe decades ago? What was he waiting? He got those stones to easy. No one could have got in his way...

"Avengers: Endgame","tavm","3 May 2018","If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","DaytonaBob","17 January 2019","The movie was mostly a lot of CGI and a lot more fighting. ALL neat to watch. BUT the idiocy of believing there are a handful of little stones that control the ENTIRE UNIVERSE? All the neat outer space scenes and strange alien landscapes all of that.BUT to say he would be able to control the ENTIRE Universe?I am sorry but that is beyond ridiculous.I am huge Marvel fan and can actually say I have been reading Marvel since FF#4. And at one time had almost every single issue of the comics they put out until the mid 70s. They were great fun.This movie on the other hand is silly. One person with a handful of stones controls the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.Do the writers at Marvel et al have any clue as to the size of the universe and that is just what we have been able to see? The bazillions and gazillions of GALAXIES, the number of planets would be a ONE followed by millions of zeros. The amount of beings, and all sorts of life forms would be a One followed by a number of zeros so large it is unfathomable.I would have bought say, the galaxy. But this stupidity of the entire universe was just that.Seriously lame. Silly and beyond any sense of rational thought. YES it is comics and just a movie but the primary belief in how to enjoy a movie is the SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Sorry, NO. And on top of that it all centered around a small planet in one of the arms of the Milky Way closer to the edge of the end of the arm than otherwise. Really? HOW did we get so lucky in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.We are supposed to believe the Thanos character would have the ability to wipe out half of that? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAI love Marvel but this should have been an insult to anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together. Oh well I hope we don't get a conclusion that reminds me of an old Saturday Morning serial of Jungle Jim where at the end of the episode where we had to come back next Saturday to that theater to find out how he got out of the predicament of being caught in a HOLE half way done and below him were lions ready to tear him apart and above him were natives ready to rip him apart and cook him.So how did he get out of it? Well Next Saturday's episode started with the voice over stating: ""After Jungle Jim got out of his last trap he headed towards the nearest village"" Seriously that is how they did it.So are we going to get either this was an alternate universe?
A dream that when one of them gets out of the shower his wife says I had the strangest dream?
Or .....? ""Thanos you bad boy, Where have you been? Your father and I have been looking all over dozens of universes. Now you put things right or you are going to get such a paddling when we get back to home!""Thanos: ""Aw gee mom you never let me have any fun""This will be the only interesting part is what silliness they use to restore the universe to its natural order minus some nutjob like Thanos.Gods above and below that was an awful movie but it was cool to see all the Superheroes in one movie.. So glad I could watch it at home and fast forward through all the fighting.BUT ya gotta hand it to the fanboys who have posted it was the greatest cinematic effort in the history of the world. And the one guy who said anyone who says differently then IMDB should immediately pull the review and probably publicly flog the person who wrote it.","8/10"

By rules of nature hype must die down over time but marvel fanboys want more bad movies? Disney's board of director's and their shareholders are laughing their ass off. They acquire the rights of a universe with some superheroes en then they release 5 superhero movies a year that are complete and utter trash but its fanbase will love it no matter wat. now a cgi war movie (were we all now how of how it will end, it doesn't becouse Disney will keep spitting out these movies until marvel fanboys stop going to these trash movies.) Is considerd better than movies like Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, forrest gump and Leon??? Well if this is the case than i will leave this site and never come back becouse i use this site to see if a movie is worth seeing.

"Avengers: Endgame","MrsMakrel","1 March 2024","The ending began slowly for me, but everything quickly picked up steam as the film progressed. You could really empathize with the characters and feel the urgency and dread as time ticked away.The MCU was a powerhouse before this film, and the film cemented its place in pop culture. Even if you haven't seen the movie, you've likely heard of and know what film is being referenced when someone says, ""the snap.""Ensemble pieces really hinge on the chemistry between the cast, and everyone here played so well with each other's characters, it was a real treat to watch.

"Avengers: Endgame","myema77","17 May 2018","Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates.
Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find?
You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered:
Slick action and stunning visuals.
The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here. Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond.With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie.
The story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing.
(The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner)
The supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe.
 On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn.
Thano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing! Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life.As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this. Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie?
Opinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie.Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme.2 stars, one for Tom Holland and the other for Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.","1/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Lewis_Heather787","28 April 2018","What did I just watch???? To be honest I don't think I can process everything and I'm not such if that is a bad thing or a good thing. To get it out there straight away I'm not a die hard fan of these films actually if anything I've losing more and more interest in the MCU as its gone on. I'm not quite sure why, just a lot of them are not for me but I can see why general audience love them, they are vey appealing. Positives.The Russo brothers were given an almost impossible task and that was to bring together a huge amount of characters in one film and tell a cohesive story that works. For the most part I think they have achieved that, the directing of the film is faultless and is a real achievement considering the number of things that could go wrong with a film like this. Personally though I would put it behind ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"" for the Russo's , those films have less problems than this one.The cast for the most part is good, I cant mention them all because there are so many however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly and I'm really shocked to be saying this, the best character in the film for me is Doctor Strange. Now I personally didn't like the character in he is own film, but thats another story, in this film he is the heart and plays an important role. Acting from Cumberbatch is obviously going to be great, but I was blown away by how good he really was. There is a fantastic fight scene between him and Thanos on his own, wow. The other standout is Thor, Hemsworth again knocks it out of the park and has really cool scenes towards the end of the film which are worth the wait. The others are all really good as well for the most part, but those two definitely stood above the rest. NegativesThis is where this review gets a unhelpful mark because it goes against the consensus of this film. For me there are four main negatives film the film, ok bare with me. Firstly its the same old same old problem I personally have with the MCU and that is the dreaded humour. Extremely cringeworthy at times and once again far to much of it especially with the Guardians, which also really don't like. I know Im in the minority on this, and I have no problem in people thinking this is the best part of the film its just not for me. 
The humour of the film links to the next negative and that is the tone of the film, which to say the least is all over the place. One second we have cringeworthy jokes and the next second its all trying to be serious. I think the Russo's really struggled with this element of the film because the humour and jokes undermine the seriousness. Do one or the other??
The third negative is the end which is a complete joke right? The end was looking at first glance to be a fantastic emotional punch and shocking end to some characters. However instead they decide to ""kill"" off characters that we pretty much know for the most part will be back for the next Avengers film next year. Marvel have already announced sequels and other solo films for characters like Black Panther, Spiderman and maybe even Doctor Strange. So their deaths are meaningless and carry no weight, brings up the question what is the point in the whole film really when we know a reasonable amount of it is going to be reversed in the next film.(I could be wrong)
The final small negative is the length of the film which is far too long, the film does definitely drag in some parts.Overall the film is probably just about good enough for 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, when the film is good it is very enjoyable and good to watch however I have my reservations. They are mainly my own fault and I'm definitely in the minority when it comes to them. However I'm wondering whether even the most die hard fan is not a little disappointed with this film like hasn't this been 10 years in the making. Finally if you like these types of films you will absolutely love it however if your not to bothered like me then you might not enjoy it as much.","1/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Vartiainen","21 June 2018","Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something.So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring.The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more.Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending... We will be talking about that ending for decades to come.","1/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","CubsandCulture","12 December 2018","Everything about this movie was portrayed as bigger and more. Bigger Action! More heroes! The problem with that eventually more becomes less and the story collapses under its own weight. That happens here but not as much as I expected. The final film is coherent so there's that. It is also largely fun. There's that too. However, there is still too many sequence of the same stuff (get the stone!) and a lot of the film is very unwilling to play with the world it has set-up. Of note Dr. Strange and Thanos (post reality stone especially) are far too punchy. You can change the fabric of reality. Why do you insist on just punching people?A film like this lives, or this case disappoints on its villain. Thanos is OK as a villain. He is played well by Brolin. How he is written leaves much to be desired. His radical environmentalism simply doesn't connect with anything that is actually happening in the world today. It makes the film feel insular and escapist in the wrong way. Moreover, the logic of the character requires him to be either a eugenicist or a ""eat the rich"" radical; the screenplay does neither. The writers try to split the different by applying the big moment randomly. (but somehow random means 1/2 of each significant couple among the heroes). It simply doesn't work. It is not chilling. It is not human. It is silly.The deaths (""deaths"") are overdone. I simply do not believe Disney is going kill off a bunch of Golden Geese. It simply doesn't have any emotional weight because too many characters that have sequels in the works ""die."" The ending only gets a hearty chuckle from me.This film is fun. It moves and most of the action is good. But it is shallow, hollow and expects us to forget how capitalism works.","10/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","Siebert_Tenseven","21 October 2018","I really tried to like this movie. I smiled and expressed enthusiasm. I bounced and nodded. I boned up on the Marvel universe. Finally the day came and I watched the movie. For some reason I was completely bored. One fight after another. Lots of stuff blowing up. Lots of people running around. Characters blowing up and running around at the same time. Is it possible I have become overstimulated by this type of adolescent entertainment? Believe me, my girlfriend and I have a better relationship than some of the so-called romance subjects in this hyped up disaster movie. I think I have grown up and comic book characters are no longer my role models. Oh well.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","geislekm","15 March 2020","For some reason, the Oscar voters will never vote for a CGI actor because ""it's computer generated'"". That's BS. The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is.
Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie.

"Avengers: Endgame","jandrfilms","9 December 2021","Anything that has to do with the Avengers, Marvel comics in general, I'm there with bells and whistles on. Love these types of movies, like I said, I'm a comic book geek.The scenes were outstanding, Thanos fighting all of the Avengers and then some who wasn't Avengers joined in to beat this evil foe. I just hated in how it ended the death of Tony Stark (aka Iron Man). Now for me, I wasn't much of a Robert Downey Jr. Up until his role as Iron Man, loved the way he brought some intelligence to the role of Tony Stark as well as humor to. I just hated that they had to kill him off.Maybe Dr. Strange can go back to that moment and change the coarse of history and still keep the ending the same, by allowing Tony Stark to live but still killing off Thanos...hmm, interesting concept, HEY MARVEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?","8/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","10 June 2018","I know I'm extremely late to the party, but I waited for a time to sync up and see it with a friend (we both have too many obligations in the education realm), plus I had to see Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok beforehand.Now before I leave any impressions, know that my experience was dampened by students with a moronic goal of sabotage by deciding to blurt out anything about the film they knew that I wouldn't want to know. I mean... what can I do to them in retaliation? Fail them? Strike them down with the hammer of Thor? Nothing, they're untouchable and they know it. It's sad, and I thought I've taught them to be better than that. Unfortunately, that select few is out there and always will be. I've waited nearly thirty years of my life for a film of this impactful magnitude to come out in its respectful genre, and individuals half of my age decide to play the card of indecency upon me and essentially impede on the level of my viewing experience.All that being said... it was a very good film, even better than I liked it (the problem was the spoilers). In fact, if I were to list negatives for this film, it would really just be all in one lump-sum bullet point regarding the lack of grounded material: a lot of space related stuff, nanotechnology (and I really don't like the Iron Spider compared to regular ol' Spider-Man), whims of inexplicable magic sources, levels of seemingly unbeatable friends and foes where I don't understand the devastation of a punch or explosion onto the individual taking the blow, and the recurring MCU element of death not necessarily being a finality for characters' ends.Conversely, there were many things that I really appreciated about the film. The first thing I would like to mention was the balance of everything, starting with the balance of characters and their moments. I thought this was going to be a massive issue going into this film, where it would just be one endless action battle and people wouldn't be able to serve their parts correctly, or they would only serve aspects as a moment of convenience to further the plot. Instead, where everyone was at during any moment seemed very natural to the overall MCU progression of items, and interactions that were had (on top of some that have yet to occur, lying in wait for the fourth Avengers film) were nicely played out. Villain encounters even appeared late in the film, which is kind of nice so that the legend looms larger as the movie goes on instead of playing beats such as: ""We need three fights between hero and villain, so let's spread them out."" Even characters who are physically inferior weren't just suitably matched up with other characters of that nature, and instead they found a way to possibly hold their own or team up to make things equal enough so that the fights could be anywhere with anyone. None of this works just in script alone; this was done by the hands of great directing. The Russo Bros have found a way to serve this great kind of balance for two straight films, though in Civil War it really felt a little more like: ""Let's force the issue and get everyone on screen at once, even in a bit of a friendlier brawl."" Admittedly some characters miss the boat of even appearing in the film, but it was few and far between, and they are explained away where frankly it worked just fine.Another great form of balance was in the light versus dark emotional moments. I have been on Marvel for having too many lighthearted moments in their films, or really too much levity for the sake of entertaining the crowd on their first viewing of a film. They really pushed the envelope with Thor: Ragnarok, and honestly I was not appreciative of it. They needed to find a way to strike the right balance of when to say what and what surface level of comedy they need to inject during the characters given the moments, but most importantly every light moment needs to be balanced with a dark moment for emotions to hit the right heartstrings. Infinity War does exactly that. I wasn't eye-rolling when they injected humor, and only one or two comedic bits were out of place for the moment they were in. That is a fair price to pay for the overall structure. They had enough characters to find those moments with in the 160-minute running time, and for once they didn't have the villain(s) either be demoted to that same level of yuck-yucks nor did they subject them to another character's comedic relief as a way to actually victimize them.This is a great time to transition to this film's villain: Thanos. I have had my quips with MCU villains being rather underserved in scope compared to that of the larger picture at play, like where they may be more of a pawn so the rest of the chessboard could do its thing. Thanos, however, appears as the king of this universe's chessboard. He was the main character in this film, and probably had the most screen time. He was not just a villain seeking ultimate domination of everything for the sake of it, he has his own goals and purposes in an attempt to restore a harmonious balance (there is that world again) for all species. It was not only believable, but it was also sympathetic. He shows remorse for his (attempted) actions, he shows mercy to those who beg for it so long as they aid in furthering his cause, and he speaks with a level head in a way that if we haven't already had eighteen other MCU films liking our heroes so much that we would actually root for the bad guy here. Definitely the best served comic book villain in a decade, if not right alongside the Joker for 'overall' status. Granted, Heath Ledger has given us the performance of a lifetime, though that character is very one-dimensional (and really good at that dimension, no doubt). Thanos really surprised me that he was more than just a large purple alien wanting ""MOAR.""I want to give the directors credit for making an extremely long running time feel extremely short. I don't know if I'm sitting here saying that I'd like to watch a whole 'nother hour of the film, but they hit the right beats and paced it so evenly that they really made time fly by in a manner that other films really can't speak for in the same vein. For all the movies I own on Blu-ray, I sometimes stop short of watching something that runs this long because I tell myself: ""This is a long film man, you are going to be devoting a lot of time to this."" I don't think I'll be saying that about Infinity War. If I were to show this to a friend who hadn't seen it yet, I wouldn't be warning them about the duration of it nor would I fear they would be looking at their watch every fifteen minutes wondering when it would end. The more you get into the film, the more you lean forward on the edge of your seat. Yes, sometimes they do cut away from characters to get to others because they have to, but you never forget your place where others are at and you aren't dismayed at the next grouping's story line. It all worked so very, very well.I'll cap this off with one thing that wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be, and it was in the movie's action. There was nothing wrong with it, but outside of some last-act battles I wasn't ever really wowed by anything either. All visual effects were top-notch, though (ehem, Ragarok was not good here too). I do think I'm putting this on a relative scale though, because it's interesting that I say that looking back at the whole picture that I think the moments outside of the action were actually better than the action points themselves, not in terms of entertainment but just in overall value. That's a good thing too, so now you're not just sitting around waiting to be getting your money's worth again. This jumps back to how the film's length is not a concern. No action scene overstays its welcome either, or it has enough dynamic elements and cross-cutting that it fits properly (again, jumping back to Civil War, that airport scene was just way too contrived... this doesn't have that). Age of Ultron was much more of a popcorn flick for me that I really do enjoy, and The Avengers has all of its lasting appeal in the final third of the film when they all assemble together, so I think I can say this one is the most consistently put together.Overall, I would say that my experience was definitely a great one and it is likely hitting inside my Top 3 of all the MCU films (The Winter Soldier still wins). I'm not ready to officially rank it just yet and I still have a lot of questions about what I saw in this one, but again that's a good thing about this film's natural depth where I'll have to watch it more than once to understand and appreciate those items. I really think the thing that brings this movie down a notch was my experience because of spoilers beforehand, and I didn't want to believe many of them to be true but unfortunately many were. This is a movie that I even avoided watching trailers for. Any knowledge about an event I am already interested in does not help ramp up the hype by me learning more about it. Shame on them for doing that to my theatrical viewing, but thankfully this film did not only rely on its spoiler-bound moments to be as good as it was. It was very ambitious, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next because I really have no idea where they want to go from here.","9/10"

It also spent too much time focusing on the villain and his rationalizations for genocide.

"Avengers: Endgame","viithtrump","26 May 2018","Marvel's biggest issue in my opinion is that there is just too much to take from comics, as it is a giant cluster mess. There is so many marvel characters now that some are just not that great and they shouldn't exist. Black panther is a yawn, and same with the second iron man (pure stupid, along with a 3rd in Banner? Are you kidding me right now?) and new younger spiderboy (even more dumb), which I feel shouldn't be in this series. Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful. I really think they are headed for clash with like Galactus and other bigger enemies and when Fox is bought out by Disney it will lead to the Xmen joining too, gets bigger and worse.

Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.","1/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","email-94961","7 May 2018","The movie has some entertainment value, but don't believe the hype and think you're going to see an intelligent or coherent plot, something innovative, or even something you haven't seen before. Disney/Marvel is riding the wave and releasing movie after movie (rightfully so) to get as much profit while the craze lasts. There's not much differentiating this Avengers movie from the other Marvel movies.","2/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","JeromeArlettaz","30 July 2018","As I do with all Marvel stuff, I've loaded it onto the tablet I keep in the bathroom. The scenes are perfectly cut for some minutes in there. And it doesn't matter if you don't remember your last visit after a day or two, there's no correlation. Wether it's shapeless, explosive, dripping, ludicrous or misleading, it always ends with the feeling that there could have been more. But even if you try harder for another minute, there's only void. And as soon as you stand up, the whole stuff is flushed out of our memory. Only persists a reminiscence of nauseating miasma.
Mankind seems to enjoy it. Well in that case, I've got a be an alien. I've decided to quit eating any fibre to never have to endure it again.","5/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Pjtaylor-96-138044","29 April 2018","'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","danjstanley","6 May 2018","I don't typically write reviews; however, someone needed to balance out the over the top love for this bad plotted film with way too many stars. For me, it all comes down to this question:
""Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?"" The answer is NO! 
I know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. 
Then, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.","4/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","AdrenalinDragon","26 April 2018","I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too.I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to 
focus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it. The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations.9.5/10","5/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","arthuradam","5 May 2018","If I am to get to the point, the movie was noisy audibly and visually. It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. 
There's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. 
Too much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other.
Wakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now.
Anyhow, there are some good parts in the movie, but it's rushed and just awful. I preferred Justice League as a movie; the pacing was a lot better.","5/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Lord_of_the_Things","29 June 2020","I understand why Marvel fans like this movie, but I wasn't impressed.From first scene to last it is just bang, bang, crash, smash, bang! The story is very weak and there is zero character development. Maybe the characters were already fully developed over the previous 30+ movies and hence why so little attention given here.I'm just not invested in the series and so don't find the Avengers movies to be much of a pay off, but get why others do. Personally, I found it to be an exhausting, unrewarding experience.I still gave it 7/10 for its appeal to the fans, but possibly 5 or 6/10 for myself.Recommended for the fans, not anyone else","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Floated2","12 March 2019","Avengers: Infinity War has become a massive box office success and occasional worldwide phenomenon. Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous.Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Overall Infinity War does offer much different occurrences, a lot if characters and a lot going on.Though one can't help feel that it wasn't as great as advertised. Perhaps a second viewing is needed down the line.","10/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","Film_star","27 April 2018","I have rated this 5 stars, predominantly because I think 9s and 10s should be provinces reserved for truly great movies. This is an entertaining one, which kept me interested for most of its overlong running time, but which won't leave me with much lingering sense of a tangible movie - it felt like a solid episode in a series I'm binge-watching, but I'll struggle to treasure many specifics of this movie from a line-up of Marvel titles.There are a ridiculous number of characters in this; the film is using that as its ""event"" selling point, but in truth it was the factor which made me most apprehensive before watching it. To the filmmakers' credit, the juggling of storylines and superheroes (and their endless sidekicks and sub-teams) was almost impressive - it never felt as though many were shoehorned too awkwardly into the forward trajectory of the overall narrative, though some characters - including leading players like Spider-Man and Black Widow - inevitably get shortchanged.The series' most rewatchable movies - for me Avengers, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Ragnarok and Black Panther - all have something compelling that feels unique to them. I'm not sure this has a unique selling point beyond a huge cast jostling for billing position on the poster, but whilst it plods along it's perfectly decent, and fans of the franchise will likely lap it up.At the time of writing, the film is ranked number 10 on the IMDb list of the Top 250 movies OF ALL TIME. I'm certain it will plummet once the general public start to supersede the fanboy rush, but this kind of kneejerk over-ranking in the context of cinematic history is a nonsense.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","austin0731","25 April 2018","Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody.Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment.Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable. But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.","1/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","namashi_1","29 April 2018","The sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 'Avengers: Infinity War', which assembles almost ALL of its Superheroes in one single film, is the biggest Marvel Blockbuster to date. Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story. 'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course!But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc.That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure!Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch! Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts.On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.","9/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","coreyjdenford","26 April 2018","This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free***** (5/5)IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock. Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron ""I'll do it myself"" and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin. How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage. Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them?Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait. VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.","1/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","frank_kneepkens","3 August 2018","Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that ""I don't understand"" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!","4/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","jhalcollege","3 June 2018","In linear algebra, a matrix is said to be rank deficient if one of its rows or columns can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows or columns. In layman's terms, this particular part adds nothing new to the overall picture, it just uses information that is already present.This happens to be the defining characteristic of Infinity War, there's nothing new here. What there is is a lot of action, a lot of CGI, and lots of bad jokes with a few okay ones tossed in the mix (exactly what Marvel has been doing for ten years).The film makes a half decent effort to distinguish arch-villian Thanos from the rest of the baddies, and its kind of succeeds on a minimal level. But in the end, he's just another world conquering fiend who's bigger and stronger than everyone else (Steppenwolf from Justice League?) who is set off to collect some arbitrary artifacts.Another issue is comes as a side effect of putting so many established characters in. Take Captain American for example, a character whose driven by morals, and whose films are relatively serious, and the Guardians of the Galaxy (about as serious as Looney Tunes). They've done fine on their own, but put them in the same scene and it just doesn't work. At this point, if you're not sick and tired of Avenger's Universe, then good for you. But for the rest of us, one thing's for sure, haters are definitely going to hate this one.(If you're not familiar with the IMDb rating formula, you should check it out. While Infinity War rests at an 8.8 at the time of this writing, it will drop reasonably over time as more casual viewers watch the film, and rate it the four or five it deserves.)","2/10"

I am pretty sure I need to blame some obscure writers at Marvel for this ridiculous plot and character. The entire movie makes a mockery of science and even science fiction. Spoiler: The idea that you could collect 6 stones (which were created during the Big bang) and then snap your fingers to wipe out 1/2 of all life EVERYWHERE in the known (and probably unknown as well) universe takes witchcraft, sorcery and the supernatural to levels beyond anything within reason. Now where do you go Disney? You gave us a worst case scenario and any future villains will be mild by comparison.

Thanos is so hyped that he shouldn't be beaten even in part 5. How is it that Dr Strange never used the time stone? Then Iron Man and Spiderman (humans) are able to breathe freely on Titan?Also annoying, Vision is carried about like a baby, limp and powerless. You just wonder whether it's the same vision that was so powerful in Civil War and could walk through walls. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting the Avengers to win Thanos in this part since it's a 2-part movie but let's put it this way; the avengers were humiliated! Probably should have been called - Avengers: Thanos the powerful.Waste of 2+ hrs for me.","5/10"

It has beautiful visual effects, outstanding performances, amazing story, fabulous soundtrack, very unexpecting, high stakes, great action sequences, and marvelous chemistry!!! It never slows down, and doubles the hype and stakes as it gets to the end. Thanos is the best MCU villain in the series! Loved the movie so much to Infinity. I've been waiting years for it, and it does not disappoint. Infinity War is a MASTERPIECE.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","Marynewcomb2013","11 October 2018","I say this a lot but, DON'T LISTEN TO THE HYPE!! This movie is the worst to date!! They didn't stick to the comics hardly at all,( I'm not an Avengers comic fan)!! Prime example of not sticking to the source material, the fight with the bad guy where they try to take the glove off his hand & having Starlord being a complete a..hole IS NOT IN THE COMIC!! What Disney did, & they do this better than any, is take a beloved character from Gardians & turn him into someone you can't stand!! That's a small example of how they messed up!! I've been saying this for a long time now but I will still say it until they finally do it, GIVE THE COMIC MOVIES A LONG LONG BREAK!!! We don't need to see two or three every year!!","3/10"

"Avengers: Endgame","classicsoncall","5 September 2018","Compared to the first two Avengers movies, I've rated this one a solid '9' against a pair of '7's' for the other two. The prequels felt more like getting the most out of all the destruction that the super-heroes could inflict on their cosmic adversaries. That formula's still at work here but it seemed a lot fresher with the team-up between The Guardians and The Avengers, while Thanos (Josh Brolin) brought a decidedly different dimension to his role as an intergalactic enforcer. Some might even call his mission honorable, in as much as he wants to save the universe with his philosophy that ""If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist"". Fresh on the heels of ""Thor:Ragnarok"", the Marvel and Disney folks do well here to keep the humor in place while dramatic events unfold throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth)/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) dynamic was especially played well, and it was a hoot to see Thor accept Rabbit's, er..., Rocket's (voiced by Bradley Cooper) claim as captain of the Guardians. Where the film loses a point for me has to do with the inconsistency with some of the principal characters. Depending on which prior movie you care to cite, Thor and Doctor Strange have been positioned as the most powerful entities in the Marvel universe. However here, they were dispatched rather handily in the early going by Thanos's minions. There's also the quite literal overkill that occurs near the end of the story with the disintegration of heroes like Black Panther, Doc Strange and Spidey, along with the entire Guardian team. You know they have to make a come back in the follow up sequel(s), so it seemed like an almost cheap attempt to elicit pathos from the audience. By my count, at least fourteen Marvel characters met their demise in the story if you include Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner in the after credits scene.Once again, and I can't help it, but kudos to Stan Lee, Marvel comic writer and originator of many of these characters, for his bus driver cameo near the beginning of the picture. His one line was particularly apropos: ""What's the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?""And oh yes, don't want to forget this little tidbit. There have been any number of movies with scenes set in New York City in which the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are in prominent view prior to the events of 9/11, but in this flick, there's a quick glimpse offered of the new One World Trade Center rising from the city skyline. I thought that was very cool, and even better that it wasn't in the path of the New York City dust up.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","skam_platform","4 September 2021","I love this film, it has the correct balance of all the ingredients. For the people saying this is better than Endgame, I suppose so, but I look at it as a Kill Bill type situation. They are parts one and two of the same film and as such should be viewed as a whole. Infinity war has so much bang for your buck that Endgame if compared it way flatter, but really they are Cause and effect, setup and resolution.Brilliant, vibrant, funny, highly entertaining and unpredictable stuff.","3/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","gradyharp","18 August 2018","Louder, Longer, Less plot - Groot has the best tool: an iPod..........
There is an audience (and a massive one willing to pay big bucks and stand in long lines ) who champion all of the Marvel Comics films. AVANGERS INFINITY WAR is no exception. At over two and a half hours even the huge cast of gifted actors - at their bet when being funny - explode, blow up things, zoom into outer space for a mission to find Thanos who goal is to rule the universe by obtaining all the funky jewels for his glove - all seem to wear thin from the plodding 'plot' and turn to dust. The true 'stars' of this huge effort are f course the CGI team - the special effects are truly spectacular, at least for the first hour. The characters don't get much time to develop but the actors assigned to the strange roles make the Avengers and their enemies entertaining. The 'plot'? 'As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.'Cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Vin Diesel, Benecio Del Toro, Chris Pratt, William Hurt, Josh Brolin, Gweneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper etc etc etc.

Escaping Asgard when Hella destroyed it was pointless since they're all dead as far as we know, unless Loki used some magic to hide them.. but going back to the beginning of the movie.... we dont know.

If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of ""everything is gonna be alright"" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more.

"Avengers: Endgame","ericstevenson","30 April 2018","I'm just going to say right now that I don't believe this movie to be as good as the 2012 Avengers movie. It's still one of the best superhero movies ever made. Thanos had made brief appearances in literally three other Marvel movies and we finally got a film focusing on him. Even at the ending credits, it says that Thanos will return and not the Avengers! The plot's pretty standard with the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians Of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from collecting all the Infinity Gems making him the most powerful being in the Universe. The biggest part of this movie is the ending in which...they actually fail.Yep, Thanos gets everything he wants and immediately gains his goal of wanting to kill half the people in the entire Universe! There possibly hasn't been a movie with more deaths of named characters. This was in fact something that happened in the comics, but it seemed so crazy I had no idea it would actually happen here! It's a shame that we don't get to see all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy in the same place at the same time. I believe this is the longest Marvel movie ever made. It certainly didn't seem like it as the pacing was so great!They said this movie would be darker, but it seemed to have a lot of jokes at first. Then came the ending and even the ending credits seemed gloomy. We finally get to see Loki kick the bucket. It's great that we have the characters reference all of their losses. It's just one awesome action scene after another. Unlike ""Transformers"" these ones are beautiful looking and creative. ****","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","willz187","28 February 2019","I'm probably the only fan of Super Hero Squad: Infinity Gauntlet but if you found this Avengers: Infinity War too heavy you should give it a try. Infinity War is filled with more super whiners than super heroes; unless you like your superheroes to whimper, demand to be sacrificed, argue, and to die. Not my idea of good times. Not lining up to see the sequel/conclusion. I'd rather read the comics, or watch it on cartoons. Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe.Try to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing. And it was cool to see so many Avengers represented. Had some cool scenes. Gave it a generous 6/10 but will never watch again.Hero up! and watch Super Hero Squad or for something less childish, Avengers Assemble Season 2, which also tells the story of Thanos.","2/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","bgsmall","19 May 2018","Caveats on this review are; I'm no especial fan of comic book storylines made into films, my primary reason for attending was to take my children for their entertainment (not mine).As you might expect from a comic book rendering; the central plot of revolves around Thanos (the 'baddie') intent on decimating humanity by ~50% of it's current number to 'restore balance' to an over-crowded universe that has dwinding supplies and no means to support the ever growing populus. Taking that and the film at face value - this is a bizzare and macarbe storyline that hurtles between fight scenes without any character development or sub-plot development whatsoever (O.K, that's a little unfair - but not much). That's maybe my own fault - as I've not seen the other (precedent) movies in this series. However, as entertainment value goes, it's a little poor and in retrospect I would not have taken my children to see it.Now, taking the central plot as something 'other' than just fantasy I have a couple of questions / statements:
1. Is the storyline in anyway faithful to what was written in the comic book storylines?
2. Who signed off on the budget of this movie? - I'm guessing it cost $$$$$$$ (that's seven, each representing a 10-fold increase in magnitude) at least.
3. Whoever (individual or committee) did sign off on this budget, then also implicitly (or maybe explicitly) approved the premise of the central plot.
4. Given that Hollywood has been used historically to influence audiences and therefore by extrapolation (largely developed world) populations via it's 'messages' (propaganda) is this warning or threat? 
5. I don't believe that a movie of such an incredible budget is signed off without having an ulterior motive (usually paving the way for later films and more money) - and unless I've missed something - they just trashed the franchise??Just because I'm paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get me.","10/10"
"Avengers: Endgame","ivan-samuelson","4 December 2018","Don't get me wrong. I love the Marvel Universe. I even went back to watch the original Iron Man and forgot that in those days, Disney didn't have their mitts on it yet. It was a Paramount movie. My how times have changed.For me, the movie was all over the place, jumping from earth, to a distant planet, etc. Yes, the war extends across the galaxy, that much is understood, but too many cross stories, and the entire former Avengers team isn't even together. It does set up the 2nd half that comes out in 2019 which looks lie there will be a head-on face-to-face again with two of the Avengers that split apart, especially since, well, you know why.All in all, the CGI graphics were excellent. Very top notch. But, a movie can only look so great before it falls under it's own weight, and I'm sorry, but AIW does just that. Editing is sub-par, there are some good one-liners, but I had just watched Ant Man and the Wasp just before this at home and that was a great movie for me. Funny, hilarious and action packed. This, so-so. Disney is trying way too hard here. Need to get back to reality and ground this series back to how it started.I dare say that AIW is the Marvel Universe's ""The Last Jedi"". Pretty to look at, but empty everywhere else.","10/10"
"Thor","RJBrez","24 January 2021","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end. Enjoy!","10/10"
"Thor","0U","23 February 2020","This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists.

Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.","10/10"

Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero.

"Thor","uzair-36867","8 February 2021","This film is an achievement unto itself. Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.","10/10"
"Thor","andreascaloni","16 February 2021","Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics.

Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.Rating: 9.6.","9/10"
"Thor","Abdulxoxo","5 February 2021","Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.
Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.","8/10"

"Thor","Puroo","21 April 2021","It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.","10/10"

"Thor","Jesper2801","26 April 2018","I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.","10/10"
"Thor","shawneofthedead","25 April 2018","Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero m√™l√©e that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.","10/10"
"Thor","Platypuschow","4 May 2018","Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film","9/10"
"Thor","cartermain","20 January 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.10/10","10/10"
"Thor","TheLittleSongbird","2 May 2018","Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox","9/10"
"Thor","garethvk","24 April 2018","Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.

"Thor","jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","12 June 2018","Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.","8/10"
"Thor","eva3si0n","8 January 2021","The first Marvel film I really liked. Surprisingly in the film there are many spectacular scenes, which are well held and the main transition between them is made seamless, which does not make you miss. And the main thing that surprises the film - the ending, it really makes it clear that Marvel now plays big, since began to break up with the main heroes of the giving films.","8/10"
"Thor","miacoop","7 January 2021","With Thanos come into play you think that the avengers would be able to tackle this problem but no. After re-watching Infinity War multiple times it still gets me because it's sad the ending really is just another cinematic masterpiece which Marvel always pull off and the fight scenes are amazing. Marvel have some of the best actors and the best casts I'm not applaud them for that. No mad Steve was just sexy after mate and I loved it a lot.","10/10"
"Thor","ACollegeStudent","17 December 2021","Rating: 9.0This went where no other mainstream superhero movie went and killed everyone, allowing Thanos to win. The biggest flaw I can think of with this is that there are other ways to achieve Thanos's goal without killing everyone, and there were some plot grievances like Corvus Glaive somehow sneaking all the way to Shuri in the battle unnoticed, and them not just digging under Wakanda's shield to begin with (they did later in the battle). Also, destroying an infinity stone should cause the universe to collapse in some way as explained in Endgame about taking stones from universes, so I'm not sure why none of the main cast raised this issue when destroying the mind stone was ratified into their gameplan (they might have not known better, though). Otherwise, great pacing, a great soundtrack, crisp visuals, seamless comedy, a compelling and humanized villain, and a haunting ending.","9/10"
"Thor","Dello_","6 September 2021","Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.","10/10"

"Thor","pjgs200","12 May 2018","I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10.","7/10"
"Thor","Horst_In_Translation","4 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once.I think that movies, especially superhero films, often stand and fall with their villain and here we have Thanos played by Josh Brolin as the main antagonist and he is just utterly great and memorable. Maybe you could say that his (self-perceived godly) ambition to erase half the planet is a bit too mathematical, but everything else about him is outstanding and I have virtually no doubt that he will end up as one of the most memorable villains of the movie year 2018. Even in his weaker story lines, like the part with his ""daughter"" that does not feel entirely convincing early on, he shines and elevates the material to a level where it really saves this entire part of the movie. So yes huge thumbs-up for Thanos. And another thumbs-up for virtually everybody else. Except Starlord unfortunately because honestly his grief may have been huge, but the how he basically destroyed the Avengers' effort that had them close to victory was just ridiculous, so to some extent you can blame him for billions of people dying eventually. Or are they really? I believe there will be a new Avengers movie in 2019 by the same team of writers and directors, so the ending may not be as finite as it seemed to be. You can almost call it a duology. Is all hope really lost? We have to wait a year and see. Honestly I doubt it because there will be a Black Panther 2 for sure at some point, so I guess they will find a way to get things right again for the good guys. It will also be interesting to see if they bring back those who died earlier too, not just those that vanished at the very end.Anyway, this film we have here is one that will make a huge impact come awards season 2018/2019 in all technical categories, especially Visual Effects where it is maybe a lock for an Oscar nomination with a great chance to take home the win. Another thing I would like to say about this film is that it is also a triumph in terms of the comedy, which is not always a success in Marvel works. But here there are some really hilarious scenes and as many bad things as I said about Chris Pratt's character earlier, his banter with Thor is hilarious. And there is a lot more of course. Drax is also amazing in that one scene where he stands there doing nothing. You will recognize many other pretty funny moments when you see them. So what is it that made this film so amazing. I would say it is the script this time. It is bold, daring and not scared of anything while never becoming too absurd or unrealistic (and yes that is possible for superhero films *cough* Deadpool *cough* glad we did not see him in here). But the outcome here is the exact opposite of too many cooks spoiling the broth, both character- and writer-wise. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this one and good thing is you really don't need to have seen any other Avengers or Marvel movie to appreciate the quality we were given with this one. I am truly very curious about the sequel and cannot wait to check it out. This third Avengers movie is my favorite 2018 release at the point of April. And it has a huge chance to stay in the top5, probably top3 until the end of the year. It never dragged, which is always a success for this running time and it gets better by the minute the longer it goes. And the way things turn out eventually reminded me a bit of the last Wolverine film ""Logan"". Happy endings are no longer essential. Realism is what it is all about. Highly highly recommended.","8/10"
"Thor","MrDHWong","25 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10","9/10"
"Thor","numenorsniper-66396","25 November 2021","I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.","9/10"
"Thor","r96sk","23 January 2021","This is exactly the sorta thing I want from an Avengers film! Full blown, no punches pulled action. In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!Despite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.Like 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.Speaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.There are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.Needless to say, I can't wait to see 'Avengers: Endgame'!","9/10"

Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.","9/10"
"Thor","lisafordeay","6 May 2018","OK I loved the sequel Age Of Ultron as it focused more on the Avengers themselves but I will get into the negatives later.Avengers Infinity War is the prequel to the 2015 film and tells the story of the Avengers who are no longer working together and must try and defeat a giant half monster/ human called Thanos (Josh Brolin)who wants the stones known as the infinity stones. Each one makes Thano more powerful and it's up to the team to somewhat get back together and join the guardians of the galaxy(Chris Pratt, Zoe Salvada,Bradley Cooper). Will they stop Thano?The special effects are very good along with the cinematography. However the film itself is 50/50 for me. The downside of this film was that there was too much going on and I was so dissapointed with the hulk played by Mark Ruffalo as you never see him as the hulk at all this time. Jermery Renner who played Hawkeye was absent in this and the film was so hard to follow e.g what happened to Thor's eye. I felt like it was skipping or whatever.Overall do yourselves a favour and watch the 2015 version instead or try and watch all the Marvel films to get used to the story.Also has Tom Holland,Robert Downey Jr,Gwyneth Paltrow,Don Cheadle,Chadwick Boseman,Karen Gillian and even a cameo by Stan Lee.","5/10"
"Thor","blparker-31738","27 April 2018","All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie.","10/10"
"Thor","TheBigSick","4 May 2018","SPOILER: The plot is simple that the supervillian succeeds, but Russo brothers waste too much time on piling up the superheroes. The film is just too long, and you keep looking at the watch to see when it will end. There are too many characters, and if you did not view the previous Marvel films, you would hardly get any sense of who they are. It is an OK film for Marvel fans, but chaos for a general audience.","9/10"
"Thor","Prismark10","3 May 2018","When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.","6/10"
"Thor","saraccan","11 May 2018","If i can somehow oversee the fact that this is just another glorified cgi fueled version of wwe, its an okay action movie.It's still very much soulless, incredibly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie matters in any way because there can be infinite amounts of prequels and/or sequels and also, certain people can control time in any way they desire. I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters.Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of ""wait, where are we?"" or ""wait, why are they fighting again?"". This one felt more compact to me. GOOD JOB!That said i still don't care about anything that happened or will happen in these superhero movies. I did pay for a ticket and therefore contributed to the financing of future films though, so you're welcome.","2/10"
"Thor","tkarlmann","1 May 2018","I thought this movie was pathetic. Thor has no Hammer, and forges an axe? Are you serious? The Hulk grapples with Thanos and is overpowered to the point where he is afraid to come out through Banner? Are you serious? Where is CA? He lost his razor AND his shield? Are you serious? Most of the things I expect from the Avengers were absent in this film. There was very little working together to defeat a Foe; and way too much about the Bad Guy -- Thanos. Like, why do I care? Thanos is the Bad Guy, so defeat him and move on! Then the Ending --- utterly pathetic!","6/10"
"Thor","RNMorton","9 May 2018","Two other titles came to mind as I watched this. ""The sum is much less than the parts"", and/or ""Way too much on the plate"". As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.","6/10"

"Thor","georgewilliamnoble","3 May 2018","Sometimes in this life there are things beyond criticism, the Mona Liza for example or Turners rain steam and speed or Chaplin in The Kid. Masterpieces all, no debate right?
Then there are products is one soap powder really better than this other, or a $1000 perfume can it really be better say than one at a mere $10, beauty they say is in the eye of the beholder! So they say. Then there is this new mega movie Avengers Infinity War, now i would take issue with anyone that this is actually a movie at all, it is a consumer product the must see/ have accessory for the moment, Pre-sold, Pre-packaged to a ready made audience desperate to spend their money, it is just another fashionable element in today's throw away age. Telephones i believe are sold this way, at least this is how i see the commercial world of now. Now, i know my views are in total opposition to the frankly ridiculous high score's on this web site, and please don't think i am not grateful, my local multiplex needs big profit films to survive and hopefully prosper so the likes of me can see proper films that are real cinematic experiences but make next to no money, usually that's the fate of most superior films these day's! 
Can i be positive in any way about this Marvel, well i saw it in 4DX & 3D, the chair swam and jolted, there were lights, flashes, and sprays or did i imagine the last one, oh yes, the sound was loud, very very loud. and Oh yes do not forget, it is extremely long, very very long, like a bad flight across the Atlantic but without the benefits of a helpful service attendant's tray. Did i enjoy it? in any way, well no, just too much of a good thing, i like sugar in my tea, but 32 spoons is to much! This i will call it for ease, a film, it just had too much of everything. Now, i can just imagine steam boiling over from most readers that i am clearly to old and out of touch, but i argue not so, the trailer for Deadpool 2 was so funny and inventive that i am eagerly awaiting this release. As for all these many many super hero's to numerous to remember and to numerous to mention, i do have a question for superhero's obviously adoring public the question is, are the comic books any better?","4/10"
"Thor","brianjohnson-20043","8 May 2018","I like the stand alone Marvel Movies more, but it almost feels like an obligation to see all of them if you want to see the ones you like, or else, you'll have no idea what's going on when the ones you like continue. I'm prefacing with that so readers understand that I'm not just a hater.First off, I want to address the villain. My opinions I've heard/read asserted Thanos is a strength to this film. I found that to be the opposite. I found his motivation more convincing than the Justice League villains, who were so bad, I can't even really remember their motivation, and a bit less stupid than Ultron who was the AI thing that might have seemed like a real issue in the 80s or early 90s. But today it seems clear that the misuse of technology to our demise is going to be gradual rather than sudden. The vulture from Spider Man Homecoming, or the villain from Black Panther were much more compelling In my Opinion. Thanos felt like a cartoonish version of the villain Samuel Jackson played in the first Kingsmen movie. Except that Thanos didn't work like how the similar villain in Kingsmen worked. They're both trying to save everything by killing off a sizable chunk of people before people kill their planet or planets. The difference is that Thanos wants to randomly and painlessly kill half of everyone everywhere, and Valentine wants to save a few chosen wealthy friends. Overpopulation and idiocy is a real issue on earth. But in the Marvel Universe, it's a planet to planet issue, and it seems stupid to just kill off half of everyone on some planets which might not have any actual problems. And this issue is never even questioned by any of the characters. They just try to play the card that Thanos should try to save people, not kill them. Not a bad point. But it didn't seem like any of the Avengers seemed even remotely interesting in addressing Thanos' concerns. Not even Gamora. Plus, if someone gets two or three of these infinity stones, let alone all of them, can't they use that person yield that power to do good rather than evil? It just didn't settle very well with me. Loki was a much better villain because he's like the Joker. Destruction and chaos is his high. That's a real thing in people that an audience should be able to understand.The strength of this movie is the humor. I laughed repeatedly and was certainly entertained in that regard. It also, no surprise, looked really good and had great music. I was surprised how well the Guardians characters fit in with the other Marvel characters. But to me a feature length movie, even a short one, can't be good if the story isn't compelling. And this movie is long. If the villain's story was halfway decent it would have stood a good shot, but just getting characters together that one likes and making a spectacle, won't make up for giant flaws in the story. I didn't expect everything to be concluded, because these movie all set up more to come. But with an ending like this film has, it should have been advertised as the 1st part of 2 movies from the start. I really don't get how the next Ant-Man movie is going to work after what happened here in Inifinity Wars. Unless it takes place prior to the events of Infinity Wars, I don't see it working. But if that's the case, why not have Ant Man 2 come out first? I'm not a comic book reader. I open them up, look at the picture and think:""I'm supposed to take these silly-looking overdramatic characters and pictures seriously? Do other people see how goofy these images are? What am I, 10? But I've heard from friends who like the comics that much of the events of this film unfolded as they did to stay loyal to the events in the comics. My response to this is that every form of entertainment's first goal should be to work within its own form. To me Infinity Wars' narrative doesn't work for a feature movie. I was upset with how it ended. And I know I wasn't the only one in the theater upset. And I find it disgraceful that, at the moment, this movie has 8.9 stars out of 10. Black Panther doesn't have 8 and it's actually good. What's wrong with people? This movie is currently ranked ahead of movies like 12 Angry Men, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, It's a Wonder life, American History X, The Prestige or Every Single Pixar Movie. What is wrong with people?","10/10"
"Thor","hawkins_saints_rock","25 April 2018","Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable. The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them. My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it. Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves. 9.8/10","9/10"
"Thor","eden-rabatsch","25 April 2018","Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.","3/10"
"Thor","nodlimax","28 April 2018","This movie has various problems and the first major one is the lack of focus. We keep jumping around to various places and I can't even keep where all of them were.One moment, we are on earth, the next on Knowhere, the next on some other planet to which I can't even remember the name. And it's not just the places, it's the characters too. There isn't one lead or even 5 lead characters we can somewhat focus on. They try to focus on everybody which means nobody is the actual lead character. There was another movie that was initially praised but in the end was heavily critizised for lacking focus on a real main character - that was Star Wars The Phantom Menace. I see the same problem in this regard here with the story.Due to the lack of focus the movie also has pacing issues and therefore to me felt boring. And then this goes on for 150 minutes. And the biggest problem at the end of the movie is that there is no payoff.......ok stop, I have to correct myself there. The payoff (here comes the spoiler) is, that the bad guy wins. Everything the heroes tried to do failed and you know what I was actually kinda rooting for Thanos, because I couldn't care enough about any of the other characters. He became the protagonist for me, which makes me feel terrible as well, because he kills half the population in the universe.In the end I was just happy that the movie was over. However the writers put themselfes in a corner. Thanos is pretty much god at this point and objectively speaking there is no way anyone could defeat him at this point except if they go for something like ""his glove lost the power after he used it"" which is cheap. That will then result in the heroes trying to get back the time stone and then turning back time or something similar stupid.I will not see the next one in cinema. At this point I am pretty much done with superhero movies. I guess I can thank Disney now for first pushing me away from Star Wars and now Marvel.The effects and sound were decent though.","6/10"
"Thor","deastman_uk","28 April 2018","How long has it been since the Dark Knight? The DC film that defined how an epic comic book fantasy could wrap a world around a hero and a villain.Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.","1/10"

The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence. For the record, I loved Avengers, loved Winter Soldier so it is not like I cannot enjoy a superhero flick. This one is not(unless you are a fanboy(girl).","7/10"
"Thor","Lursa","6 May 2018","SPOILER ALERT!!
I am a Marvel Chick. I totally dig the whole Marvel Verse and wave my 'fangirl flag' proudly. I was looking forward to this movie so much...then something happened. I went to see it today. I did not read any of the reviews before I went. I never do. I always view a film without input from folk that usually don't know what I like. So there I was, popcorn and coke in hand. Two rows back from the screen ('cause I'm into total immersion, okay) in my reclining seat. Ten minutes in and I know we're in trouble. It's not the fact that two of my favorite characters didn't survive the opening credits. This is Infinity War, right? People are gonna die. It's just seemed so pointless. Loki dies but Thor survives? How is that fair? Hemdall dies saving Hulk of all people?? Not that I'm hatin' on Hulk...but come on, Hemdall! You have sworn an oath to the 'Thone of Asgard' and you don't save EITHER of the princes? Really?? I know Hulk is refusing to 'come out' after Thanos kicks his butt that no one ever has before but still...The movie goes rapidly downhill from here. Thanos and his twisted cult of psychopaths got on my nerves early and they danced all over them until the end of the film. We bounce all over the world (and off it) to keep Thanos away from the Infinity stones. Who decided that two of the most important stones be 'hidden' on earth? Not a good idea. Our Merry Band of Marvel Heroes needs to take a page out of the Star Trek verse. 'The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few or the one.' This could have saved SO many lives. Loki gives Thanos the Tesseract to save Thor. Thanos tried to kill them all anyway. Actually succeeds in killing both Loki, Hemdall and all of the Asgardians. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, the daughter he loves. (Thanos has a really weird idea of what love entails...but whatever) He does this so he can gain access to the Soul Stone. Dr. Strange gives Thanos the Time Stone to save Tony Stark. (Tony Stark? Wasn't his expiration date up like a couple years ago?? ) This gives Thanos the power to turn back time whenever he wants. Which he does after Scarlett Witch kills Vision (her lover) to destroy the Mind Stone. He just turns back time. Rips the stone out of Vision's head and heads off to wipe out life as we know it. So Scarlett Witch went through all that gut wrenching heartache for nothing.This could have been a good movie. Maybe even a great one but it's not. It's a mishmash of the worst parts of just about every Marvel movie over the past 10 years. There are a few notable omissions. Most of the gang is on deck but they're so ineffective. They rehash the same differences they had in their other movies showing little or no growth or development aside from the superficial 'romantic' themes. I get that Pepper and Tony are an item. We knew this already. I get that Black Widow and Bruce are an item. We knew this two movies ago. Same with Gamora and Peter, Scarlett Witch and Vision. and on and on and on. This is supposed to make their loss more poignant but it doesn't. The fight sequence in Wakanda and on Thanos home planet were so predictable. Such a waste of excellent CGI and actors.The only surprise in the movie is who survives. Thor, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers survive. I know this is to set up the next part of the Infinity War set that is scheduled to hit theaters later this year. The Russo boys need to step up their game. This disappointment does not bode well for the new film. Guys. sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Just FYI. You just know that someone is going to get hold of the time stone and turn back time so we can blah, blah, blah. Been there, done that. I really wanted to love this movie. I really, really did. But I left the theater feeling used and not in a good way. I felt like Marvel turned up the manipulation meter to eleven. Because, you know it's eleven which is one more than ten, right?I rated the movie a '4' because I wanted it to be good. It just wasn't.","2/10"

"Thor","gcarpiceci","2 May 2018","Sometimes when you cook a dish for your guests, you think that you'll make it more tasteful if you keep adding ingredients over ingredients; so, you have made this nice pizza, you have put your tomato sauce, your mozzarella cheese, maybe some ham, then you think why not some mushrooms, and well peppers will be just perfect on top it, and don't forget olives and cappers, hey we have some sausage in the fridge just slam it on top of it....etc. Most likely your guests will spend the night wrestling with your heavy-loaded pizza, trying to digest it.
Well, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars.
Note that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc...

"Thor","TheSeaLion","1 May 2018","While all of the heroes from across the Marvel cinematic universe united in a joint effort to stop Thanos, so too did all of the problems you can think of unite in a joint effort to bring down ""Infinity War.""It should be noted that I am not the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the most part, I find the movies to be passable while there are a few I have really liked, such as ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and some I have despised, such as ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers."" ""Infinity War"" could have fallen anywhere on the spectrum for me, and unfortunately, it fell at the way-down low side as the second worst movie in the entire franchise.The opening scene of the movie is the perfect setup for what is wrong with ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attacking an Asgardian ship with all of the main characters from ""Thor: Ragnarok"" on it. Thanos has killed everyone aboard, except for the few characters necessary to help keep the plot moving. Heimdall (Idris Elba) is left wounded so that he can be killed off by Thanos on screen after using his powers to send Hulk (Bruce Banner) to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers. It is supposed to be an emotional death scene, but the laziness of the writing and the showcasing of character stupidity for the purpose of plot progression is all too evident. Why didn't Thanos just kill Heimdall during the attack on the ship like he did with everyone else on board? It's simple: the plot would not be able to continue if he had done that.Character stupidity is at an all time high in ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" and it is not just restricted to Thanos. There is a lack of communication between characters for no reason other than for the movie to happen, and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) goes so far as to screw everything up in what is easily the worst written scene in the entire movie.The stupidity of the characters can all be attributed to an awfully written script. So much of the dialogue in the movie is the Marvel quips, but a lot of it comes in the form of characters throwing personal jabs at one another to the point of wondering why these heroes can't set aside their differences and not be annoying for even five minutes in order to stop a villain who wants to wipe out half of the universe's population.Yep, that's right. Thanos' goal is to wipe out half of the population of the entire universe. One complaint that people have had with Marvel is how safe their characters all feel. So, Thanos killing off half the population would seem like it was putting their characters in danger, right? Wrong. All of the characters who are killed by Thanos are the characters who had already overstayed their welcome in the franchise or do not feel permanent because, let's be honest, they are needed for future installments to the Marvel universe. It is ironic that the movie that seemingly takes the most risks is the movie that played things the safest.Even if these deaths did feel like a risk, it would not really matter. With so many characters to focus on, the movie has almost no time for character arcs (which is fine) and instead must show its characters through their speech and actions. However, so many of these characters act so annoying or stupid that you are just wishing for them to be killed off, and then the characters who are killed at the end by Thanos destroying half the population lacks any emotional weight because after nearly three hours of unbearable characters and dialogue, it is just a relief that the movie is almost over.The two things that ""Infinity War"" did well was not making the story feel jumbled and clustered with all of the characters, and they did do a good job with the characters of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany), but that is it. When it comes to everything else, the movie falls prey to a term film critic Roger Ebert used, which is 'idiot plot.'Idiot plot means that the only way for the plot to happen is for the characters to act like idiots, which I already went into a little bit to explain how even the smartest of characters have to act like morons in this movie for the plot to progress, but the entire plot of the movie is an idiot plot as well. Thanos' plan to wipe out half of the population only makes sense to the point of his backstory. In execution, it is a plan that falls apart and becomes dumber the more you think about it. This might be, though, because the movie tries to paint Thanos and his plan off as having depth to it, but this sort of plan would only make sense and work for a generic super hero villain who just wants to destroy the world because he is evil. So, with a villain with faux-depth and an evil plan that would only work for a generic super villain character, the overall plot of the movie is a dumb villain scheme that has awful juxtaposition to it.""Infinity War,"" to put it simply, is just awful. Nothing more, nothing less. And for a movie this big that had a decade of hype and buildup and planning, that is just sad.","6/10"

Because, and I'm not telling you one word about how it ends, this has to be the WORST way to end a movie I've ever seen...and wished I hadn't. The heck with it.

"Thor","imaxxing","3 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. 
That being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. 
Infinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.
 
So, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.Great CGI.No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.Too many characters.The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. 
For the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.It bordered on a comedy.For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. 
While some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.Geared towards a younger audience. As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents. It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. 
Most of us have outgrown the cliches. Poor ending.Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling. A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film.Overall 6.4/10","8/10"

"Thor","AGood","4 May 2018","This film was literally 2 and a half hours of non stop roller coaster action. This may sound like the perfect movie. But just think of this for a moment.The film was literally;Villian comes on the scene, whichever avengers is around flies or runs at them. Gets bounced back. Flies again, gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back.Then an escape happens, as the villian always gets what he come for as even his minions are way too powerful for every single avenger in the film. Cue literally 2mins of wisecracking and jokes. Next scene cuts eslewhere, villian comes on the scene, avenger flies or runs at them, gets bounced back, then 2 more mins of wisecracking and jokes..... for 2 and a half hours.The diaglogue is minimal in the extreme. Possibly only 200 or so words get said in total throughout the whole 2 and a half hour movie. Almost all of it is just filler wisecracking jokes.Watching this movie honestly felt like watching someone else play a video game, with the 2min cut scenes kept in.I don't know if I am getting old, or if it was just this film but I did not enjoy this. I loved black panther that I seen a month ago. But also hated Justice Leage so am not sure. I get the feeling kids will love this and think it the most epic thing they have ever seen. But parents will be bored. A movie needs to be more than just this.","10/10"
"Thor","mitrapourmand","14 May 2018","We all know that these movies are blockbusters , we know that we should not expect much , when someone sits through one of these he /she should not expect citizen Kane , or the seventh seal , these movies are almost always mindless action scenes and big bangs and boom ( throw in a few punch line and some lame one liners and voila you have have your self an action movie ) but , at the same time these movies must be compared with other movies of the same genre , even the same universe to see pros and cons and for this i like to review it based on two of my favorite MCU movies. Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings .","2/10"
"Thor","dcortner-19918","10 January 2024","The best Marvel movie to date IMO. Fantastic all-around. The pacing was spot on, and I was very concerned about it going in. I thought I'd be feeling bored or dragging around the 2hr mark. But when Thanos reached Wakanda, I knew things were ending soon and I actually remember thinking I didn't want it to end.The cast were all stellar in their roles. Love Cap's new look. Really enjoyed seeing RDJ back on-screen as Iron Man as well. Tom Holland really surprised me with how emotional that Spider-Man death scene was. The ""I don't want to go"" got to me.I thought we'd get some exposition or the Avengers reuniting in some capacity first, but I'm glad we opened with a Thanos attack. It helped establish the pace and set the tone. The movie kept that tone throughout. Thanos is a badass, but I also really enjoyed seeing his backstory and character. In his own twisted way, he definitely did care for Garmora. The relief on his face at the end was a really strong moment. He completed his goal, in his eyes he's done the universe a great justice and now he can just relax.I do hope that at least Loki & Gamora stay dead. I understand those that vanished are going to come back but I think bringing those 2 back would be a bit extreme.I thought for sure Tony Stark or Steve Rodgers were going to bite the bullet in this one. But it just makes me that much more intrigued to see where things go from here.Also, I have to shoutout the score. The music in this film was incredible. I'm not familiar with Alan Silvestri but he did an amazing job. The score enhanced every single scene, and helped immerse me into this world. Fantastic work.","10/10"
"Thor","fcabanski","20 October 2018","The writing was on the wall with an early fight between Thanos and Hulk. OK, Thanos is all powerful, but he beats Hulk with a few punches and knees. At least make the fight big.The writing got worse when the Guardians of the SJW Galaxy took the screen - cardboard characters wisecracking their way through vacant scenes.In fact, that's most of the movie. Most of the men act like 12 year old boys, arguing at the drop of a hat. That's supposed to be Stark's gimmick, but most of the heroes (males) act that way. There's no difference between Stark, Peter Parker or even Dr. Strange or even his Buddhist buddy.Most of the dialogue is banter. Mostly the so called actors pose their way through scenes. The fight scenes are so CGI and camera movement heavy that it's impossible to tell what's happening.The movie made a lot of money - a lot of people love the Emperor's new suit.","9/10"

I am happy that it feels like and is a Thanos movie, a movie about a giant purple men who is here not because to kill smth but to fullfil his deep inner beliefs which is well written and understandable for the audience.
The level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.This movie is not perfect. Jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and Peter Quills occurence with Thanos at Titan is not well thought out.

"Thor","SnoopyStyle","11 May 2018","The Avengers face their most powerful opponent yet in Thanos. Thanos is collecting the six Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet to execute his evil plan. The heroes of the MCU struggle to stop him.It is amazing that this works as well as it does. This could be best described as The Empire Strikes Back portion of the MCU so far. The heroes get their butts kicked from one end of the universe to the other. It ends with a mass disintegration which is honestly even sadder and much darker than TESB. TESB ends bittersweet but this is just dark. Although anybody with a brain would see that the snap will be reversed in some way. There are many deaths that cannot happen which does diminishes the shock value of the ending. They can't kill off Spider-Man because the MCU doesn't even own him. Sony would never let it happen. They also can't kill off Black Panther due to his future movie and more importantly, his new popularity. Obviously, some characters will not make it but I think the vast majority will rise from the dead. The constant death reversals in the MCU saps away the shock value and that's probably this movie's main drawback. If they picked different characters to disintegrate, I might have doubts about reversing it.The advantage of the MCU is that these characters are so familiar that none of them needs introduction. In fact, this one starts from the end of Thor: Ragnarok and is no worst off by it. The relationships are well established. It's great fun to have them run into other heroes they've never met. Thor joining the Guardians generates a whole lot of hilarity. Drax is especially funny. Quill's insecurities is fun. There is an interesting pairing of Stark and Dr. Strange with Spider-Man as a fun sidekick. Relationships continue to be the strength of this franchise. The heroes are so well defined that the movie can spend its time with the villain. One of this franchise's weakness has always been the lackluster villains but Thanos is allowed to have his character development. His view points and his love for his daughter Gamora give him real depth. In many ways, this is Thanos' movie and it is more compelling due to the development.I do have some other minor issues. The giant Dinklage may be oddly cute at first but it's just odd. That section doesn't have the same action as Wakanda. Thor holding open the iris is not much of an action scene. I'd rather have that section finish quicker without flipping back and forth there. I would push that section back into the middle. The plan for Vision's stone seems like a low percentage play and his reasoning for sacrificing himself seems much more poetic. There has to be a way to do a ""needs of the many"" scene earlier and end in the same place anyways. Overall, this is well-constructed, well-conceived, and well-made. Despite the darkness, it still has its fun. The plot never stalls. The villains are great. The heroes are never in doubt. The franchise continues to be in good hands.","1/10"

"Thor","phoenixinvictus","6 August 2018","I can almost guess how the sequel is going to go... they are going to use some ridiculous time travel trick to undo all of Thanos damage. This two and a half hour movie was nothing more than a ten minute cameo for each actor to fight some alien.
The HUGE plot hole in this movie is Thanos ""plan"" and Ant-Man's mysterious absence in this movie. Let's see how absurd the plot hole of this movie is... Thanos' master plan is to wipe out half the population of the Universe because according to him there aren't enough resources for us all. Have you seen the size of the Universe??? The resources are almost endless! The Universe is a BIG place people! How can anyone not point that out to him? With his magic gauntlet complete he can just ""magic"" all the resources he wants with the snap of his fingers. Duh! But that is not all... Ant-Man possesses the technology to END WORLD HUNGER!!! All he needs to do is supersize ""a steak"" to the size of a ""truck"" and presto you can feed an entire city for weeks. Right there is the weapon to end Thanos' dumb logic.
Almost right in the beginning of the movie Thanos kills off the Asgardians on the ship, except for the main characters because... well just because we'll dump logic out of window and not bother the audience. Thanos then kills Loki-for REAL this time. Let me please have a moment to laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA! Even if Loki is really dead this time I cannot feel anything but amusement at this ridiculous death for he has died so many times that I have lost count! Why should I feel sorry for a guy who wanted humans to worship him as a living god? Wasn't this the guy who literally placed his father in an old folks home to rot away? Wasn't he the one responsible for starting a war of genocide? Wasn't he the one who was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people and caused the near destruction of New York City? Wasn't he the one who caused the invasion of New York City by aliens?
Let's face facts! Nearly every Marvel character has died and been brought back to life that it actually is getting boring!
Heimdall who is wounded uses the last of his powers to transport Hulk\Bruce Banner to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers instead of-I don't know- beaming the tesseract away from Thanos. How about sending it to the edge of the Universe? It's not like he has a locating beacon to find these things.
Gamora wants to stay away from Thanos because she knows something that he wants and makes Star Lord promise her he will kill her (yeah right). Gamora then does the very thing she said she wouldn't do and runs directly to Thanos to engages him in battle where we all know that she will lose.
Aliens attack New York again. What an unlucky city. Doctor Strange is abducted and Wong doesn't seem to care that his friend is in danger and returns home... Really Wong, I'm so disappointed with you! Why doesn't he open up a portal to rescue his BFF? I know that Doctor Strange wouldn't have abandoned him... of course there is the fact that Wong's ten minutes were up and the studio couldn't afford him. Okay Wong I forgive you. Doctor Strange doesn't use his magic gem to turn back time and ""bargain"" with Thanos. Why doesn't he do it? With the help of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spiderman and Star Lord they hatch up a ""plan"" to remove the magic gauntlet off Thanos rather than just cut off the guy's arm off! Star Lord being the screw up that he is screws up the entire plan. Doctor Strange simply gives up the time gem because it's the only way to prolong this agonizing movie for another hour! Why didn't I just stop watching this movie?
Captain America who is a fugitive is suddenly pardoned because he is just so darn good looking and awesome in his costume. Vision says that he won't trade a life for a life but there were so many lives lost during the battle to remove the stone from his head. Wakanda is invaded and the Hulk refuses to come out of the closet... So why was he saved and not someone else? Does anyone care? Why didn't Wong and his friends appear in the final battle and lock the evil alien army into the ""mirror dimension""? I'm just saying... Everyone dies and we all know that they aren't going to stay that way. These movies get worse and worse each year.","9/10"
"Thor","robert-85923","11 May 2018","I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular.However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly. At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before. I just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle... When it finally did end I felt cheated of the time.","3/10"

"Thor","antialias11","13 May 2018","*** Warning, mild spoilers ahead *** Ok, what sticks out about this movie? Nothing much. 
The acting is lackluster. No character has a character arc - understandable because none of them are given any significant screen time. The whole movie is basically one endless 3-hour brawl (with some battle scenes blatantly ripped from Star Wars/Lord of the Rings). Some of the brawls are so over-the top that they are ludicrous (even by comicbook standards). Example: When you break a moon into pieces and hurl all of them at someone on the planet below within one second then the impacting pieces should not just make a puff of dust when they land. The motivation of the villain makes no sense (after achieving his goal the universe will just be back to the earlier situation soon enough). Given that it's hard to emote with a villain in the first place having a full CGI villain makes it even less likely. Some of Gamoras mood swings in the matter where we're supposed to emote with him or her make even less sense.Speaking of CGI: It's on a level we've come to expect with some weird exceptions. E.g. in one instance we see Bruce Banner's head in the open cockpit of the Hulkbuster armor while he's standing around in the background - and it looks like someone just copied it in with MS-Paint. Seriously. Not even Photoshop quality but MS-Paint.The humor is relegated to one-liners and most don't land. The serious one-liners are predictable and pithy. 
The music score is effective if somewhat over-the-top pathos-heavy (but that's not unusual for US films, so it' one of those things we've come to expect to have to endure)The overwhelming feeling is that this movie was ""designed by comittee"". The boardroom idea seems to have been: ""Take the things that people enjoyed in other movies and make them non-stop"". 
Problem is: It doesn't work that way. Gems in movies are that because they are rare. Taking the time to lead up to them makes the payoff all that sweeter.After coming back I rewatched the first Avengers movie just to see if my memory deceived me. But no: It is a way, way, WAY superior film in every respect.","9/10"
"Thor","Jared_Andrews","5 May 2018","Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection. There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges. Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all. I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts. Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does.The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve.So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea. For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless.Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected. The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians. The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. 
Spiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony ""Mr. Stark"" and Tony calls Peter ""kid."" There's a certain father-son/mentor-prot√©g√© sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever.Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music.Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints.1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him ""Vizz"" is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention.
2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it.
3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie.Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did. Join the phenomenon and see Infinity War today. If you love superheroes, you will probably love this movie.","9/10"
"Thor","gavinp9","25 April 2018","SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much. The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista). The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.","9/10"
"Thor","Leofwine_draca","29 December 2019","So, here we have it: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the Marvel climax to a string of approximately twenty prior movies and considered by many to be the crowning achievement of the genre thus far. And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!","3/10"
"Thor","MxS7HGS","28 January 2024","Infinity War is a favorite among superhero fans. It tells the story of how the Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, confront Thanos, an Eternal, who is determined to gather all six infinity stones and wipe out half of the universe's population. The fate of the universe rests on their shoulders.It begins with a high stakes opening sequence on a ship, where Thanos and his children are introduced with well-written dialogue and a powerful score by Alan Silvestri. The Hulk's confrontation with Thanos showcases the sheer might of the Eternal, establishing him as a formidable adversary for the Avengers.Despite a large cast of characters, it balances them well without feeling overstuffed. It tells a compelling story in two and a half hours, maintaining consistently fast pacing. It features notable performances from actors like Josh Brolin, who plays Thanos with great intensity and Robert Downey Jr., who delivers some of the best-acted emotion in the entire MCU, adding depth to his character.However, some parts of the movie are criticized for feeling contrived or lacking in visual appeal. For example, the moment when Starlord punches Thanos feels forced, and the CGI and aging effects on certain suits are questionable.Despite these flaws, Infinity War is a monumental achievement in the MCU's early phases and stands as a convincing assertion that these films are indeed a form of cinema.","5/10"

"Thor","realmuthaf","6 May 2018","Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good.The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway.There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone ""for balance"" with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah.Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around.I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable. This, however, just continues the downward trend of movies like Guardians 2 and Thor 3.","1/10"
"Thor","Shadowboy_25cm","23 November 2021","""Avengers: Infinity War"" culminates the 10 years build-up of the MCU to this first part finale:The villain is very powerful, complex and interesting to watch, although his final art design is not that impressive as other impressive versions of Thanos.There is a lot of super-hero drama, a lot of apocalyptic atmosphere, a lot of smart subplots and impressive locations, there is a lot of surprise.The movie is very watchable and constructed somehow around best-of-scenes, very fast-paced, jumping from one important fight and conflict to another leaving behind some logic. The action and the SFX are impressive, I as a viewer have nearly none time to chill out,
it's a tour de force till the final battle. Very courageous by the makers to finish this movie as a Part 1-movie of a 2-part-finale (just like the new ""Dune"" movie by Denis Villeneuve in 2021).It's a good MCU movie (it's better than the second part ""Avengers: Endgame"") that relies on the former MCU movies to keep it as a fast-paced, gripping story till the end.Highly recommended.","8/10"
"Thor","maruugaa","18 May 2018","I'm not a fan of Marvel or DC or basically anything that Disney creates. Unfortunately, my friend wanted to see it and I figured:
1) There's a chance it could be good, considering there were other movies I thought were going to be bad, such as(Blockers, The Purge, Keanu, and even Wonder Woman) that turned out to be good, so I shouldn't pass this off right away just because it's Disney
2) I figured it couldn't be worse than Red Sparrow.Anyway, I was wrong to both of those. This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence.The only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade.The entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life.With the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class. Also, as someone who was forced to go to Catholic Church as a kid, if you've ever gone to the Good Friday or Palm Sunday mass where they all read that dialogue in monotonous voices that's so insufferable you're in pain? That's how I felt in this movie. I would've rather been a child at Good Friday mass again, because at least then there was prospect of a Cream Egg for sitting through that drawl.","9/10"

"Thor","PedanticEditor","2 June 2018","This movie is shockingly bad, especially compared with the other avengers films, and is the absolute worst Marvel movie ever made. Almost as bad as the Batman vs. Superman movie was for the DC universe. Fair warning, this review is all spoilers - not that it really matters since you shouldn't see the film anyway.I saw the film today and I can't help but conclude that the writers of this film were just lazy. For shame! I get that Infinity War is supposed to be the first part of a two-parter, so pretty much all the good guys had to die. But there are ways of making good guys lose without having them act like lobotomy patients throughout the whole story and literally die from stupidity every step of the way (oh, except for Spiderman who is inexplicably the only intelligent character in the story). In what ways were the good guys unbelievably dumb every step of the way, you ask? I'll tell you. And then I'll tell you what some better written alternatives could have been. This is just from memory, so there are probably more instances of bad writing that I've forgotten.1. Loki gives up a stone to save Thor, even though it may be possible to resurrect him later and Loki knows half the universe will die as an eventual result.2. Loki goes after the more-powerful-than-gods Thanos a moment later with a knife. An effing knife!3. The first thing Dr. Strange does is as Ironman for help. Whaa?4. Dr. Strange gets tangled up in weeds and faints, then to be carried off like a swooned and helpless fairytale maiden.5. Gamora attacks Thanos first, by herself, even though she knows she alone holds the key to a stone.6. Gamora gives up the final stone to relieve her sister from momentary torture, knowing that half of all life in the universe will die as a result.7. Wakanda opens its forcefield, and the super-duper powerful lady stops guarding the last stone in order to fight.8. Star Lord prevents the other good guys from removing the infinity stone holder from Thanos by deliberately saving Thanos from the mind control lady.9. Ironman didn't punch Star Lord's lights out when he saw that he was getting ready to do something moronic.10. Neither did Dr. Strange.11. Thor stabs the Thanos through the chest with a super-axe (which was obviously stupid in the first place, but even then he has time to pull it back out and chop off the baddy's head), and instead the baddy says ""You should have gone for the head"" and sucks himself into a portal to escape.12. Last, and least important but still annoying, the Hulk is effectively impotent for no good reason.Here are 3 Possible solutions off the top of my head that would have been less poorly written:1. Dr. Strange is distracted by something even more important for the entire movie, so that the other heroes can die tragically, and in the second movie he stops being too busy and just rolls back time and undoes Thanos' acquisition of the stones - also causing the heroes to not die.2. Same thing, except Dr. Strange or his compatriot could have opened up and closed one of their portal thingies to snip off Thanos' arm with the stones on it.3. Thor could have died trying to make the super-axe, or he could have cut off Thanos' head and someone else evil could quickly put on the stone-holding glove thing instead. Either way would have been an improvement.","3/10"
"Thor","rowpotdroid","29 April 2018","Suffering hype fatigue, over a year of industry talk about this movie in pre release. It takes away from viewing the movie. In the end it's just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age. The first avengers was original. But now what Hollywood movie makers due best, take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs. Sorry about raining on your Hollywood comic book Heroes block borer. But the only hero I can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels. They've become boring and predictable recycles. I spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie. Seems Hollywood is addicted to CGI for making movies that shouldn't be made. If they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up, no story, plot or actors acting just things blowing up.","9/10"
"Thor","bob the moo","27 August 2018","I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.","2/10"

"Thor","bradykitchen-33648","15 March 2022","This film is phenomenal. I have no other way of putting it, they do a amazing job especially with how big this film is. The Russo brothers do a crazy good job with managing this huge cast. Every character is given some sort of purpose and their time to shine and it makes for through the roof entertainment but also a well written movie.This film has a really big advantage over other MCU films, all of the characters except for one have been developed. It allows the movie to focus far more on the plot and making a quality story and less so on showing who these characters are. This movie is very fast paced, which creates what is the most entertaining MCU film.The one character that was developed was Thanos played by Josh Brolin. He is the best MCU villain because he was developed. Almost all of the MCU films have one issue and that is the villain. Most MCU villains are not given enough development to be considered a good villain. Thanos is the polar opposite. This film does an amazing job of explaining his character and explaining his motive. There are a few times where you actually ponder whether he is right and that shows how well written Thanos is.The action in this film is insanely well managed. You get to see each character have their action moment and makes for a really entertaining watch. The comedy was also very good and I feel they managed it a lot better than other MCU instalments. I find a lot of MCU projects use comedy at inappropriate times whereas this film did not.In terms of gripes there were a lot of plot holes, which is hard to fault them on because of how much they already have to deal with but plot holes are there and they need to be mentioned.Overall this film is amazing.

"Thor","TheNabOwnzz","2 August 2018","Since i am not a little boy that has an absurd kind of fondness for Marvel comics & thus its movies, i am able to judge them objectively without being prejudiced by a couple of adults flying around in capes. And with this knowledge, it is quite obvious that Infinity War is indeed objectively a terrible movie.As stated before i am admittedly not a Marvel fan, and i did not care to watch any of its predecessors before this one. It ofcourse should never be a requirement to watch about 18 films in order to comprehend this one better, but to be honest you really don't miss anything during Infinity War's simplistic narrative if you have missed all its previous films, except for maybe knowing the characters in it. But judging from what i have seen none of them are even slightly relatable even when having watched previous films. So even if you have watched previous films, a connection with these characters is impossible since they are so terrible written and often times poorly acted.First off, i cannot fathom enough how terrible the screenplay is. A couple of characters try to be funny and come up with lines of dialogue a 8 year old could have though of, such as: 'Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards' or 'Why is Gamora', or the discussion about Thor's new haircut. The plain stupidity in its dialogue and writing is basically an insult to the audience's intelligence, and thus it is a very dumb and low IQ motion picture due to this. The acting is mostly terrible, except by perhaps Josh Brolin ( Which is saying a lot, since he was a pure CGI character ). Especially Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt & Tom Holland all hand in absolutely atrocious and horrendous performances. All of them try to be funny and joke around in serious times, but it is never funny, instead its terrible pretentious attempt at creating wisecracks results in loads of cringeworthy scenes that will make the audience embarrassed to witness. Although in the three actors's defence, the abysmal script didn't help their performances either, and they are only partly to blame.The only interesting character in the film is Thanos, and while it does help a little bit that he has the most screen time of all characters by far, he still seems to be a victim of the clich√© fest that is Infinity War since his reasons for wanting to take over the world are hardly original ( Sacrifice the few to save the many kind of motivations, which we have all seen before ), and can probably be found in the 'Standard Hollywood villain rules guide book' anywhere. None of the 'Good guys' are relatable because their dialogue is so ridiculous and since the only intelligent person in the film seems to be Thanos, as everybody else seems to be lacking in self awareness and self consciousness on every level ( Especially all the times people who know what Thanos is capable of keep attacking him like they think they have a chance, what a joke that is ).There is once again a lot of sub par plastic cinematography with many artificial backdrops, especially in Wakanda. None of it seems particularly natural, and thus the film also has this visually artificial kind of feel that further decreases your immersion ( Although the characters already decreased this pretty far down with their terrible dialogue ). There is no depth or real sub text in the film except perhaps Thanos showing little Gomora his knife balancing which symbolizes his view of a world in balance, but that is pretty much all the cleverness in it. It also has a lot of melodramatic scenes ( Especially with Vision and that redhead woman whose name i forget ) between characters that you cannot relate with, and the only thing that i wanted to see happen was Thanos killing them all, as he was the only individual with even a slightly bit of depth or character, thus making only him, the villain, relatable. Ofcourse as is standard in modern films Infinity War is also very politically correct in that it uses a lot of women warriors fighting like men against eachother in order to negate gender differences like there are none, which further enhances the notion that this is ultimately an irrelevant film.Admittedly the only strength this film might have comes from Thanos's character, and everything else seems irrelevant due to terrible acting & writing. In the end, despite that a lot of characters meet their demise, it still feels as though nothing is really at stake because all the characters are frequently making unfunny jokes & dumb decisions, which in turn leads to the question: 'Why should we care?'","8/10"

"Thor","PedroReviews","30 January 2024","Avengers: Infinity War, the culmination of Marvel Studios' decade-long superhero saga, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that defies expectations and delivers an exhilarating and emotionally resonant experience. The film masterfully weaves together a multitude of storylines, bringing together an ensemble of beloved Marvel heroes to confront their most formidable foe yet: Thanos, the ruthless cosmic warlord seeking to restore balance to the universe by wiping out half of all living beings.At the heart of Avengers: Infinity War lies a complex and compelling narrative that explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the delicate balance of fate. The film challenges conventional superhero tropes, questioning the very nature of heroism and the cost of saving the world. Thanos, portrayed with chilling intensity by Josh Brolin, emerges as a formidable villain driven by a twisted sense of righteousness, adding a layer of moral ambiguity to the story.The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing the impressive power and skill of each Avenger. From the intense clash between the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos's Black Order on the planet Titan to the epic showdown in Wakanda, the film delivers a visually stunning and visceral spectacle that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, Avengers: Infinity War excels in its character development, giving each Avenger ample screen time to shine. We witness the growth and evolution of beloved characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, while also introducing new heroes who make their mark, including the brilliant Doctor Strange and the enigmatic Scarlet Witch.The film's emotional impact is profound, as we witness the bonds of friendship and camaraderie forged among the Avengers tested to their limits. The loss of beloved characters is handled with sensitivity and depth, adding a layer of tragedy and realism that makes the stakes feel incredibly high.Avengers: Infinity War's most defining moment, the one that will forever be etched in the minds of MCU fans, is the ending that leaves half of all life in the universe decimated. This shocking and heartbreaking twist serves as a devastating conclusion to the film, leaving the audience reeling with questions and anticipation for the future of the MCU.","10/10"
"Thor","AlsExGal","26 August 2018","Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan? The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (""Stop Thanos""), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.","1/10"
"Thor","radursm","3 May 2018","Not everything that glitters is gold! I'd say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars.
Returning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.
The last ""Avengers"" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.
Yes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine.But the ""Avengers"" franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back.
""Infinity War"" is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It's a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.

Plotline, it had potential but due to time limits done by the studio and editing team it wasn't fully developed (Yes I understand half of you are going to say 'but I want my movie to be an hour and half and mindless fun'. and to rebut that, you can look this up here on imdb, 90%+ of movies that have made the most money and have the highest ratings are at least 2 and half hours long, most being over 3 hours so don't claim to represent the majority). 4. I would have liked this movie a lot more if they would have split it up into 2 movies, which would have been warranted with the material they were using in the movie. In the end, this movie was the 'might have been' movie. Too many 13 year olds went to see this movie who have never went to see movies before this.","1/10"
"Thor","mt-95256","28 April 2018","TL;DRA phenomenal achievement - 10 years of films leading up to this has been worth itSimple story allowing so much to be packed inInfinity Stones are more than just dull McGuffinsA wildly different story and structure to most superhero filmsStructure more like a Game of Thrones episode - this works to its benefitThe ending is bold and brave - a real strength of the film as a wholeAll characters are fantastic - their interaction is the greatest joy of the movieNo one character hogs the film - everyone gets their fair share of screen-timeThanos is the greatest Marvel villain so farAbsolutely hilarious and very quotableSublime, varied and non-stop action that never feels like too muchSets up Avengers 4 very wellThe greatest Marvel film yet--------------------------------------------------------------Wow. Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a clich√©, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...","10/10"

But I at least thought some of the action would be entertaining. But it wasn't. Not one action scene was any good. Thor Ragnarok was a masterpiece compared to this. This movie was truly dreadful. My girlfriend, who normally likes any superhero movie that's action-packed, even though this movie stunk. Many boring scenes of talking....all about nonsense. Because when every single character can do absolutely anything....when every character has powers that are limitless....like for instance, let's go to outer-space, let's teleport, let's shoot a rope that curves 20 times and wraps around our opponent....when anyone can do anything....the result is total boredom after a short while. The 9.0/10 rating here is Fake News, I guarantee you that. Statistically impossible....especially for such a bad movie. I was sooo bored.","10/10"

"Thor","SamALMan","9 May 2018","I am not a comic fan.. I never read printed materials on infinity war and now after watching this movie I feel if I have the chance to read it, I will.Anyway.. the movie started where one of the most recent Marvel studio movies ended, Thanos is on quest to collect all the infinity stones to proceed with his plan and while doing so he faces opposition attempts by the avengers and others.You will definitely feel shaken by the first scene in this movie and the shock won't wear out by that scene.. Thanos is determined to collect all the infinity stones even the one that is unknown whereabouts to Marvel movies fans to fulfill his aim.. the aim that made his quest to collect infinity stones understood and analyzed. It hold a real nice philosophical thought that really worth all the time to analyze. The visuals were amazing in this movie, specially for Thanos and the new characters. You can read emotions better on the main ""computer constructed"" character, they are very close to the emotions that you may be able to read from human real face. It is a fast based movie with few ""quiet"" scenes and short scenes with slight laughs here and there to lighten the mood. The characters who appear in this movie have varied screen time but it is noticeable even when some characters get longer screen time, they do not overshadow the efforts of other characters that have lesser screen time. The movie is definitely aiming to please group of audience that appreciate certain types of jokes and references. ********** SPOILER Begin**************
There were no introduction to Thano's snap.. by looking back at Thano's reasons to kill people, I never find it connected to the moment where he snapped his fingers.. he snapped as a impulse or reaction to an avenger attack.. his reasons where corrupted by emotions!.. but definitely showing that Thanos would do anything to have this power in his collection. 
********** SPOILER end**************Marvel studios started a huge project with multiple layers and stages that will make it impossible to wrap it as a perfect project.. you will definitely see slips here and there specially when the other Marvel studios productions seemed connected to this movie. At the end I would say that this movie is more suitable to young audience (to me 40 years and younger). Comics started as a ""relief"" and ended to be an ""art"".. This movie is one of the good examples of a nice modern comic movie.","9/10"
"Thor","IQ42","8 December 2021","Holy crap. This is what I was missing out on? That movie was freaking epic.Thanos is at long last (after Hela) one worthy opponent for the Avengers - almost too worthy. The way they managed to give everyone some screentime and even do it well was exceptional! It was just so cool and funny and suspenseful!I'm sad for the Asgardian people, though. And since when is Wanda this strong? It's a bit disappointing that the infinity stone wielder Vision himself seems to be that weak.When Thor was about to beat the crap out of Thanos, holy moly. That was one epic move.I can see that I'm not even sure what to write since there is not so much plot but rather the movie is just filled with action. It was definitely a blast.","2/10"
"Thor","brsmarc","23 May 2018","WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI went to see AIW in the hopes of washing away the taste of mediocrity of Black Panther. Having seen pretty much most the other Avengers franchise and predominantly liking them I thought BP was a deviation from the norm but, I now see with AIW's this might be the new normal.This color by numbers film is probably what the average fanboy would hope for: formulaic plot, a who's who of super characters, an odd and apparently solipsistic villain, a barrage of special effects, machines of destruction and a few melodramatic emotionless bonding moments.The entire two hours and twenty odd minutes ends up being nothing more than a long, boring commercial for the sequel (which will also likely dupe the same crowd of lemmings) into forking over $10, $15, $20? for a ticket. The ""deeper"" interpretations will probably dwell on the conflicted nature of Thanos and his complex subtextual commentary of the state of diminishing resources in their world (hint, they mean our world) and the Orwellian double speak where, when he and his henchmen/women go on their intergalactic killing sprees they pronounce (without irony) that they are not murdering, they are liberating. This is the language of dictators, despots and mass murderers (Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler). His insatiable goal to collect the infinity stones for his special glove/gauntlet will give him ultimate power. How serious is this villain about gaining ultimate power? Well he actually trades away his soul (technically its not his) for the ""soul infinity stone"". Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.In this rendition, our friends from prior Marvel movies seem to be not marvelous at all. This is the foundation for every 8 yr old boys ""fighting argument"" (eg: Who would win if Aquaman fought Spiderman? Or ""who's stronger Hulk, Superman or Batman?) fun and engaging sure, if you're an eight year old boy.But what makes this movie such a mess is exactly the notion of more is better. You could put all your favorite foods together on a plate and one look would make you say, ""Yuck, this is disgusting""But its the weight of expectations, need to generate huge box office, and this kind of ""ultimate hero fantasy"" that makes you feel like ""lets simplify"".","4/10"

"Thor","walentys","3 July 2019","The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for ""comedy"" is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a ""lighter"" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for ""comedy"" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film.Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing ""modern Marvel movies"" as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula.The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place?Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were ""just there"". No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into ""one united Avengers"" character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos.The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it.Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.","1/10"
"Thor","jwag777","9 May 2018","If you get your thrills watching the Avengers get their butt kicked, seeing at least two die, and enjoy the villian being the star of an entire movie, this film is for you! Plus throw in an almost non existent Hulk, a Thor with no hammer (he does get an axe towards the end of the movie), Captain America with a kids toy shield and no mask, and a basically worthless Vision, we'll, you get it. I know this a two-parter and a lot of what happened will be rectified, but it was still a huge disappointment to me. Did enjoy some of the hero pairings and the humor was mostly funny, but it wasn't nearly enough for me.","10/10"
"Thor","hotjanuary","13 May 2018","Infinity War is a good super hero movie. But I thought Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther were better.Marvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies.
1) if a battle between the Hulk and Thor in Ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat I'm pretty sure Hulk vs Thanos in a spaceship would last one punch.2) Star-lord is just a dude, he does not catch and hold Spider-man.3) If Tony Stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in Iron Man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in Waconda? I'm sure War Machine would have access to activate them.4) If Scarlet Witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near Wakonda why do 2 dudes in Scotland give her a hard time?5) Steve Rogers isn't invulnerable. When swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth he's apparently unharmed after Thor's hammer clears the baddies away. They had time to rip Steve up but didn't?Don't take the easy way out when writing the story. A lot of it was good but some of it was not. Writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief.
1) When an elaborate plan pins Thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he can't DESTROY THE UNIVERSE nobody would stop to talk to Thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe. At the very least you shut up and HELP REMOVE THE GAUNTLET so Thanos can't destroy the UNIVERSE!2) Gamora really thinks Thanos doesn't love her? All that time she was talking about Thanos not loving anyone made no sense. I kept thinking, Gamora, you're being really stupid, everybody knows what's going to happen... maybe you should try running or anything?3) When Thor arrives at Wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump/smash. Banner even feels he has time to stop, open his helmet to say ""You guys are so screwed now!"". But when all the heroes go to protect Vision from Thanos.... Thor arrives AFTER Thanos gets the last stone?I know I'm picking. It's because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and I'd rather not have anymore X-men The Last Stand or Fantastic Four (2015).","2/10"

Other than Black Panther and warriors from Wakanda, but it shows more the often that The Avengers and the Marvel Universe lack diversity and is white privileged. It is yet again white people saving the Universe! Where did we hear that before! Also why does Marvel incorporated Thor, a greek god in their series and not for example the God Krishna from India? Towards the end there were so much of the same going on that you don't feel any empathy anymore of the entire Avengers crews when they died one by one, and you start to think the Universe might aswell be perished, who cares....cant stand the fact that this movies continue to go on and on, and wishing for it to end!

"Thor","glofau","2 May 2018","A movie should stand on its own two feet as an entertainment experience. You shouldn't have to watch 18 other movies first in order to enjoy a film. Unfortunately, to enjoy Avengers: Infinity War, you really have to have seen all the other MCU films or this film doesn't really make any sense. Hell, they rarely even introduce characters by name, let alone give you any clue as to who these people are. It really takes shalllowness to a whole new level of yawn-inducing ennui.It's not like I haven't seen any other Marvel superhero movies; I've seen several. When I was a kid, I read the comic books. And I still had no clue who most of the characters in this movie were! And I certainly didn't give two hoots whether they lived or died.The film is a spectacular, eye-popping kaleidoscope of sumptuous costumes, special effects, and MONEY spent lavishly on just about everything. The salaries for the all-star cast alone must have sucked up a huge portion of the film's budget. But who cares? If you weren't already invested in the characters, you aren't going to become invested in this sea of nameless wisecrackers spewing rather clever (but pointless) dialogue endlessly.I couldn't make it to the end, I walked out about halfway through. I hear the end is the best part but I couldn't summon enough interest to care. They lost me with the meaningless major death early in the picture. Snore! I don't go to a film to see favorite characters bite the dust! Especially since they'll just have to resurrect people so they can make their various contracted sequels in their own franchises. This film is an expensive waste of time unless you're a rabid fan.It's all about the story, man! Without a good story and some time spent up front getting you invested in the main characters, a movie is nothing. Black Panther was terrific because it had a terrific script but this film sucked rocks because its script was a shallow, mediocre snooze despite the witty repartee. Don't bother unless you're a big fan of the MCU.","8/10"

there is no any fight I see from captaion and black panther, just a few punches.
even end was not that good. I thought this movie will be better than first one but now I know first one will always stay best from all.Tony didn't stay in earth and I didn't like it.
action scene were good but not compared to what we saw in civil war.
This is very big movie, there must be some scenes and actions which supposed to be unforgattable. You will also feel at least one time that this isn't movie about avengers or saving earth/universe. its about thanos and gamora story. good time wasted there. No complicated plots. plot holes. no combination of music/sound.

"Thor","jessfaith-45971","8 June 2018","While Avengers Infinity War has some cool action and funny lines, its many death scenes of beloved characters including scenes of characters in pure agony can make this movie very challenging.

"Thor","RoBiN_SinGH211221","30 September 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","4/10"

Thor and Hulk may not have beaten him, but they should have done more damage. On Thanos' home planet, even though he had multiple infinity stones, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Star Lord, Drax, and Mantis should have taken Thanos down with their collective strengths.And the ending.

"Thor","ssatvaya-16480","19 June 2021","AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...
Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb .....,
Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".","10/10"

"Thor","joshkej-84077","30 April 2018","I'm not a huge fan of the superhero genre, but I'm able to appreciate these movies and have a good time when I watch them, however I can't say the same for Infinity War. Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic clich√© formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and clich√© There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.","10/10"
"Thor","slightlymad22","29 December 2019","I just rewatched Avengers: Infinity WarThe nailed it. Against all the odds of juggling THAT MANY balls in the air, they pulled it off and it just gets better every time. It is imperfect, but it's still great.Josh Brolin is great as Thanos, he is a great villain!! Too many Marvel movies have weak villains. Not here. He is a great character, it is pretty much his movie. Continuing how great he was in Thor: Ragnarok, Chris Hemsworth steals the movie as Thor!! No mean feat in a movie with this many awesome characters. Robert Downey Jr is as awesome as always (when isn't he??) as is Tom Holland, he made me cry, it not going to lie. Mark Ruffallo has more to do than normal as Bruce Banner.Chris Evans and Benedict Cumberbatch are more supporting here as is Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany (even though I was crushed with there final scene) Sadly, Scarlett Johansson is wasted here!! She does not really have much to do.As usual in a Marvel movie, the action is great and it nails it's humour too!! One of Marvel's best for me.","10/10"

One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it.Really worth watching it , if u non Marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch , really enjoy it .

"Thor","judemcrobbie","20 March 2021","I have basically nothing but praise for Avengers: Infinity War. Considering the rest of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are very safe and don't take many risks or deviate from their generic formula, this does. These movies will go down in cinema history, for better or for worse, and I do truly believe this deserves to be there.
There are plenty of reasons this is the best MCU instalment and one of the better movies of the decade:
The primary reason is the villain, Thanos. He played spectacularly by Josh Brolin, who even in motion capture gets all the acting through. The MCU has had such weak villains throughout so to see Thanos done so well is a great change. I think the genius behind how Thanos is the best villain is because the way the movie cleverly poses the question ""Could he be right?"". This gives him not only a sense of moral righteousness to us but we can truly see the ""No one thinks they're the villain"" philosophy making him so compelling. The opening scene of the movie shows the mad titan effortlessly slaughtering families in his quest to destroy half the population of the universe. He seems completely unfazed by this like he's done it before countless times. There is a clever line of exposition in this after this, not only backing it up that he has (That we will see a flash back showing he's been doing it for at least 20 years) but also how he got the first stone. I like this decision to say rather than show this as it puts us in the action of the people we actually have emotional resonance with, The Asgardians. Throughout this scene we see the two previously strongest characters, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), get not only beat down by Thanos but humiliated. This is especially prevalent in the hulk as we don't see the fight between Thor and Thanos. We do get to see the fight between The Hulk and Thanos however. This is one of the best set pieces in the franchise as not only is it bombastic action but also shows character for both of them, but especially Thanos. Through a mere few counterattacks, Thanos decimates The Hulk. This shows the brains he has, not fighting like the animal The Hulk does, and showing he also has the strength to go toe to toe with the previous strongest avenger. The genius behind the decision to show the brains is that t circles back to when in the final fight he says ""You're not the only one cursed with knowledge"". In this scene we also see the smarts of Thanos, outsmarting the God of Mischief-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He ultimately kills both Loki and Heimdall (Idris Elba), the final remaining people from Thor's previous life before the first Thor and the avengers. I think the next time we see Thanos on screen is in the Knowhere scene. In this he uses his grip over the weapons he has gathered, showing their abilities and his ability over them by cutting through The Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff) with ease and going as far as to turn our beloved Mantis and Drax into Spaghetti and just blocks respectively. There is a lot more in this scene which I could talk about, Peter's arrogance and the Guardians dysfunctional family ultimately leading to their downfall to the hand of a competent villain, but I will elect to talk on the emotional climax of the scene, Peter Quill attempting to kill the love of his life in order to save humanity but getting the rugged pulled out from underneath him. This leaves Peter in a complete state of disarray as if he had killed he would have felt immense guilt for killing the one true love of his life, and if he hadn't then he may have just doomed the universe. No win situations like these are perfect for developing character as we get to see them in difficult situations. This drives Peter and the rest of The Guardians the rest of the movie. There is two more Thanos scenes I would like to would like to talk about: the first of which is the Nebula torture scene. This is a truly perfect scene compared to the many others. Marvel has a tendency to crack jokes unnecessarily, which I'll get into later, but this is just completely devoid of all that humour which is just perfect. The fact Gamora says ""I always hated that chair"" and Thanos deciding to bring himself to the lower level, not feeling the need to assert his dominance over her sets up the next scene perfectly, and then the other thing in this scene is the decision for the 'Mad Titan' no to torture Gamora and instead torturing Nebula, again this makes the next scene perfectly. Then the final scene of the Thanos chat is the Vormir/Soul Stone scene. This scene is just chilling. When Red Skull (Ross Marquand) pronounces that you must give a soul you love for the soul stone, the reactions from both Thanos and Gamora are just amazing. Thanos goes completely silent, null and void he thinks over what he must do. The tear shed shows the pain perfectly set up in the previously alluded scene, but understanding he must do what he must do. In his eyes it means crossing the fate over the universe over his daughter and the only person he ever truly loved. Gamora in this scene is fantastic as well. She originally believes that Thanos doesn't love anyone and therefore he will fail, going as far as to taunt him about it. At the beginning the taunts come thick and fast but they slow down with her voice realising there's only one thing he loves. The climax of Gamora trying to kill herself instead of having to give the stone to Thanos is what makes the scene so great, giving the moral compass of The Guardians and she carries that to her grave ultimately.
Another reason for this being this being the best instalment in the franchise is because of the writing and acting for/from every character:
Iron Man is the man who started all this and Robert Downey Jr. gives a trademark performance. He brings the narcissism and arrogance that comes with the character. He also shows the swagger but more he brings arguably the fourth personality trait of Iron Man's tenure. This iteration brings the most human Iron Man. He has always had obsessions but in this the obsession is with having a child. This is started as far back as Captain America: Civil War (2016) with the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland). In this Spider-Man was easily the youngest superhero, he was still in high school, so Tony Stark saw him as a child, which later became his child of sorts. This is emanated as the same you want to push your child but not to the point of harm, Tony brings Peter Parker into the fight to expand the help for Team Iron Man or whatever it's called, but at the first sign of real danger he tells him to leave. This is carried over to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) where we see Iron Man as the mentor, Uncle Ben figure of the MCU. To those who don't understand that, Uncle Ben in Spider-Man is the man who teaches Peter humility and ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Tony Stark has this trait in this as he teaches Peter not to thrill-seek and do it for the greater cause, what Tony Stark had to learn 9 years prior in the first instalment of the MCU, Iron Man (2008). I say all of this because he gets annoyed at Peter for getting on the spaceship as he is fully aware that it could be a one way trip. The line Peter says ""I can't be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man if there's no neighbourhood"" encapsulates the lessons taught to him in the previous instalments of his character in other MCU movies. Then to see Peter die in his arms has to be the killing blow, comparable to losing a child. Not only does Tony feel this, but because of all the time spent developing their relationship in other movies and this one, we the audience also feel this like the dagger Tony Stark has just been stabbed with, both physically and emotionally. The back and forth between Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Iron Man is brilliant, it evokes the feeling when two of the worlds greatest but heads, like Messi and Ronaldo or Lebron and Curry. The ""I speak for myself"" from Doctor Strange is completely unnecessary and he just affirms Tony Stark's point but it shows however on the same tea, they are very much at each other's throats. This is even more apparent when in the spaceship Tony and Peter save Doctor Strange by blowing a hole and releasing the vacuum. Doctor Strange doesn't thank the pair but proceeds to make an indirect threat to them, saying he will not hesitate to not save them in aid to keep the Time stone. Also another 'alpha' character in Peter Quill joins them on Titan. This throws another problem as he has no willingness to listen to anyone but himself.
Thor is clearly fighting out of vengeance towards Thanos. Though not all by the hand of Thanos, in the last 3 features of Thor he has lost his father-Odin (Anthony Hopkins), his mother-Frigga (Rene Russo), his brother-Loki, and his four of his best friends in Heimdall and the warriors three (Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano). This man has seen everyone die around him so the guilt he must feel is through the roof. This is said by Mantis when trying to empathise with him. He is very much motivated in this by vengeance, it is because of this he is so powerful as he has ""Nothing left to lose"". This gives Thor the reckless abandon needle to take on Thanos alone or take the weight of a star to form his weapon. The will to take the weight, heat and energy of a star shows how much he was connected to Mjolnir. In very much way the the Tardis feels like a person in Doctor Who (1963-Present), Mjolnir had a sense around it that it was more than just a weapon, not just how Thor and it interacted but it's perfect timing and the noise it makes feeling like a language. Speaking of people Thor has lost, Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was destroyed early by Hela (Cate Blanchett). There isn't enough words doc for me to get it all in","4/10"

"Thor","daendil","6 May 2018","Warning: spoilers.There is not much one anticipates from a superhero movie. Spectacle (with lots of CGI), iconic characters, some basic story arc, and saving the world in the end.
Infinity War didn't deliver. And I hate to utter that. I hate to command movies to stay within they genre... But if they don't, there must be reason. There must be good reason. The makers stripped this movie of the most important superhero-flick-features and what remains, just falls apart.First of all, there are way too many characters (could this have been the reason behind the ""end result""?). And then the story arc: it's a downward spiral. The heroes try to stop the villain(s) at multiple locations only to fail one time after another, letting the villain march through with his plan and collect each and every one of the stones. And finally the world is not saved. The end. Cast. Oh, wow. Thank you.Now for the spectacle: that was ok - though most of the fight scenes were too shaky and chaotic for me. I would have preferred less and more detailed scenes, but I don't complain. It a little bit felt like a Japanese anime though, where one combatant pulls a big ass weapon only to have their opponent pull an even bigger ass weapon, and on and on, until one time an entire moon (!) was dropped onto our heroes...For the positives: we did have some good laughs, and the main villain is well detailed (for a superhero movie). Also, Peter Dinklage!Lastly I hate to be blackmailed to watch next episode like this. So no, I will not watch the next one, at least not in the movie theater.","6/10"

I had no idea what was going on and the tedious CGI and probable impossible situations and loud music and interminable explosions made this a tortuous event to sit through.

"Thor","BA_Harrison","28 April 2018","A mean, ugly purple dude scours the universe for the pretty gems that fit into his snazzy metal gauntlet, intent on using the power of the stones for his own nefarious needs. It is up to a team of brave superheroes to try and stop him.I've fallen way behind on my MCU, and am probably not the best person to comment on this latest instalment; or maybe, just maybe, my objectivity makes me more suited than most avid fanboys.For the best part of two hours I was reasonably entertained by what unfolded, despite not knowing the backstory to several of the characters. The plot was pretty easy to pick up, the action scenes were visually impressive, and there was never a lull in pace. It was slick, big-budget popcorn fodder designed to appeal to the masses, but which hardly qualified as revolutionary or indeed, all that memorable. Eventually, I could feel tedium creeping in. And then the last act changed everything...The final√©, in which half the population of the entire universe ceases to exist, makes Avengers: Infinity War a movie that lingers in the mind long after it has ended. Spiderman, gone. Dr. Strange, gone. Black Panther, gone. Groot, gone. And many more besides. Well-established characters vanish in the blink of an eye, and I have to admit feeling a lump in my throat at their casual dismissal. It's a bold move, for sure, and one that will guarantee discussion from all that stay the distance (which reminds me, be sure to remain seated for the now obligatory after credits scene).6/10 for the first two hours or so, but that ending... I'll be generous and add a couple of extra points for Marvel having the balls to go ahead with it.***EDIT*** Having pondered the fate of so many superheroes, I now expect Marvel to bring most of them back to life in the next film via Dr. Strange's powers of time manipulation-not such a ballsy move after all. My rating might be reduced to 7/10 if this is the case.***","10/10"

"Thor","plasticanimalz","15 July 2018","I wasn't going to bother with a review but then I read the first review by blparker that said everyone giving this a bad score were trolls who didn't see the film, then went on to praise it like it was Citizen Kane. I found that rather humorous. My suggestion is to see this in the theatre as the VFX are the only thing it has going for it and won't translate on the small screen. I had no idea this was a 2 hr and 40 min film until I bought the ticket and I seriously contemplated walking into another film because I just did not expect much from this film. When the film started it poorly leapt straight into a scene as if we were in the middle of the movie rather than the beginning. It didn't make a lot of sense other than a set up for on of the long-standing characters to die. Once we moved past this terrible scene it got a little better, which kept me in my seat 'cause the first 10 mins of the film made me want to leave the movie as I was afraid the rest of the film would be like this. It doesn't get much better but at the very least it manages to be entertaining.There is a plot, though, there is very little to it. If you know anything of the Infinity comic, which also was not that great, you know that a lot of characters die. The difference is they killed characters in the comic I cared about and the movies they don't even bother to have those characters, so, whatever. Secret Wars was a much better comic and tells how Spider-Man got his black suit, but it had actual story, so, I guess they didn't want to use a better comic. Infinity truly is one big dude fight. But not even that exciting of action. I thought the Black Panther action was better. I'd read that a bunch of guys don't like Rey from Star Wars because she's a Mary Sue, which I learned means a woman with ultimate, unstoppable powers. Funny, I've never heard a name for guys but they bothered to come up with one for women. Basically, every dude in this film is a Mary Sue. If Thor has the power to resist a star how is it he can't get out of a couple steel girders a wizard wraps around him? How is Captain America always so invincible? He was always kind of a lame character but now he's all-powerful in this universe. Why is Spider-Man suddenly Iron Man? What is the point of Vision, for someone so powerful he doesn't seem to do much other than whine.I did think Dr. Strange was cooler than his own movie in this film. Tony Stark, always likable. Thor was very enjoyable, and I loved his scenes with the Star Jammers. Peter Parker's humor was funny and I liked him better in this film than Homecoming. The best scenes for me were the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Pretty much everything they do is good. The best comedic line was from the bald Black Panther woman, which, unfortunately they didn't show that much of her. In fact, this was a 2 hr 40 min movie with only 2-3 minutes of screen time for the few female characters they've bothered to add to the film Marvel Universe, who are mostly only in the films to make the guys not look gay. The Scarlett Witch seemed to be one of the most powerful characters yet her few scenes were only dedicated to talking about how much she loves Vision and fawning all over this boring robot guy who doesn't seem to have emotion. Yep, a real attractor for women. Black Widow has been lame from the start. A Shield Agent with no powers whom they've given laser guns to, on the team with a bunch of super powered dudes and a god. Lame. There's a long assortment of Marvel super power females they could have added to Avengers but they literally just added someone to look hot. It really annoyed me how underused all the female characters were in this film. Black Panther's sister was the star of the Black Panther film and she has no purpose in the Avenger film other than to cut out Vision's stone. She's basically an extra.I've never kept much up on Thanos 'cause he's a relatively boring character who wasn't very often used in the Marvel universe for the 10 years I read Marvel comics. I think he was more of a Silver Surfer or Rom villain...which, did anyone actually read those? I thought the idea that balance is used as bad and evil was a bad message. What is he now, an eco-terrorist? He didn't seem so much crazy as a Green Peace dude with too much power. Thanos chose people at random so he wasn't a racist, a bigot, or anything else, he was by the films portrayal an environmentalist. Humans thin out animals when they ravage the terrain. How is it different? I go to films to be entertained, not have these poorly plotted out existentialism by stoners moments. In the past 6 months, Infinity War, Jurassic World, and The Last Jedi all had these nihilist themes or moments where they are trying to express some weak, childish form of morality but it is actually anti-heoric, selfish, immoral, or just lame.I, in some way applaud the writers for making the film mildly entertaining despite the amount of characters they were working with. That is a challenge. But, overall there wasn't much story going on or actual emotion so I really didn't care when they killed off a good chunk of the heroes. All I could think was, ""Oh, his contract is up, so they're killing him off. They didn't use her anyway, so, of course she's dead. Oh, well, he's a new actor every 2 or 3 movies, so, no surprise."" Didn't care. The entire film was fairly unmemorable and my life could have continued just fine without seeing it.","9/10"

"Thor","jtindahouse","2 May 2018","There are some films that simply can not be reviewed without going into spoilers. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' is one of them, so fair warning. I watch roughly 150 films each year and yet this is the first MCU movie I have seen. Not a single one of them up until now appealed to me. What finally got me along to see this one? Well the fact that it is currently sitting in the top 10 of the IMDb Top 250 had a little to do with it. I had to see what all the fuss was about. There are some truly tremendous and groundbreaking films in that list and the top 10 in particular holds some of the greatest films ever made. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' has no business being there.There are a lot of characters in this movie to keep up with and it is frankly exhausting at times. Admittedly, the film actually does a pretty god job of balancing everyone and giving them sufficient screen time and a purpose for being in the movie. There are so many characters though and so many story arcs that it can become a little frustrating waiting for the good ones to role around again. What I've learnt is that there are some incredibly strong characters in this universe ('Iron Man' was the stand-out for me) and some phenomenally weak characters too ('Captain America' probably being the weakest from what I could ascertain). The strongest thing the movie has going for it is the character of 'Thanos'. A genuinely intimidating, menacing and threatening villain is always the key to any superhero movie being good. Josh Brolin plays him brilliantly (as he always does) and this film owes a lot to that character alone.Now let's get into those spoilers by talking about the ending. Basically 'Thanos' wins and with the click of his fingers kills half the universe. We then see roughly half of the superheroes crumble into nothing and ""die"" (supposedly). I suspect this has a lot to do with the film having such a high IMDb rating. It turns out people love an ending where the bad guys win. That makes me happy, because it doesn't happen anywhere near enough in Hollywood today. My problem with the ending though is this. If you really think those characters are dead, never to be seen again, then you are sorely mistaken. So in that sense it is incredibly cheap. I hate movies (universes) where a character dying doesn't actually mean they're dead (DC is just as guilty of this sadly). As if this isn't obvious enough to 90% of people, the film actually reminds of you of this fact not 5 minutes prior when a character is killed only for 'Thanus' to go back a few moments in time and thus bring him back to life.Enjoy this film for what it is. It's a great looking flick, with some excellent action sequences, funny one-liners and a menacing villain with a clear and simple plot that is easy to follow. It's done well no one could deny that, but don't try and claim that is something truly great and worthy of the IMDb top 10 because that is simply not the case.","8/10"

Minutes of pure action, people that were fans, were not fans or think they are fans watched this movie around the whole world, their are groups of characters that fight for the same thing and as the movie goes on, more and more characters group together until there is only pretty much 1 big group of heroes. This movie is unique because the heroes aren't the protagonist, it's kinda the amazing villain Thanos, he is emotionally driven and his story is great, he is kinda a hero, he thinks wiping out half the universe is necessary to safe the universe from problems caused by overpopulation, he knows it is crazy and solving a problem means trying not to hurt anyone but he believes he has to do it! He is constantly getting hammered by the heroes and you kinda feel bad for him, there is no villain. This is why he is a great villain, he is not trying to be a menace out to blow the world, he is trying to do his part and save it.Another thing I love is that anyone can watch it, anyone can enjoy it even do they don't care about marvel, the MCU works in a way that someone only has to watch some movies to understand that there is a connection with these stones, and someone going after all of them is a big deal! The movie is it's own think and is pure fun superhero action, it is great and truly has a infinite amount of fun.The movie is a must watch and is the big event in a way, it is kinda the first part and the second being Avengers Endgame, both movies are their one story at the same time as being a part of this now over a decade long franchise.

His goal is to save the universe by killing off half of its life with the snap of a finger...and enjoy the sunset. The film combines all the Marvel characters available to do a film to fight the villains and Stan Lee to play a bus driver. The feature assumes you have seen all the other films as there is zero introduction of character, and hopes you have forgotten a few minor details that conflict with the current film. The film is generally darker than previous films, but still has the humor. I wished Star Lord had discovered a new tape whereby he could defeat Thanos. Not thrilled with the plot or ending.

Many of the characters are likeable esp the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Hulk and Tony Stark BUT, there are just too many groups involved with too much repetition. The plot is mildly interesting daring to touch on overpopulation crisis. Thanos makes a good point. Though in true Hollywood style, he goes about it the wrong way. He should have sterilized half the planet, not dissolve them.","8/10"
"Thor","Top_Dawg_Critic","30 April 2018","A film that exhilarates and cheats you at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes. Sure, non-stop action with all your favorite heroes and foes, yet an overly fast paced plot leaves only the outstanding SFX to remember when you feel cheated by the ending, and knowing you have to wait another year to close-out the mystery. So until then, you have to jump to your own conclusions. Not a fan of these type of plots. Still, exciting and well directed and acted. A generous 9/10 from me.","5/10"

"Thor","l-r-patrick","2 May 2018","Firstly, special effects were really good, cast was also very good! I grew up reading these comics and Thanos along with Doctor Doom were my two favorite bad guys!
Thanos is very good in this film, it's just the writers obviously don't know the comics very, or just think they are better than the likes of Stan Lee and Jim Starlin who
was the person that created Thanos. Thanos kills to please Lady Death, he does not kill just because he thinks there's to many people, what a stupid idea that was.
I mean if he is worried about there not being enough resources for the population, once he has the infinity gauntlet, he can solve that by creating enough resources for
everyone! It would have been so simple to have Thanos worshipping Lady Death, her just silently watching, and him, as in the comics trying to gain her attention by 
killing to please her, but that was to complicated for the writers to put in, as audiences would not know who she was, lol. Self explained by Thanos, easily done, 
we've not seen the dwarf before, but he magically appeared, I mean, that was another waste of a whole sequence, Thor trying to get a hammer made (Beta Ray Bills 
hammer btw), I mean WTF, just have his proper hammer rejuvinate and hold the power, oh yeah, these writers wanted to change that part of the story as well.
These writers need to know, Stan, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko etc etc wrote and created these characters and they should stick to the original elements that made them
what they are today. They think they can come along and rewrite these stories in their vision, just like JJ Abrahams with Star Wars and Star Trek, they think they are
better than the original creators which they are not by any means!For me it's getting to the point where I don't really care if I see these films anymore, they just let me down every time, where these writers don't do the proper research
and just create it in their own way. The comic fans made the comics a success, without us over the years, there would be no films, so maybe you should try to please the
fans before the random cinema goers?Bits that really annoy me, no Lady Death or any celestial power beings of any kind, Red skull appears on the planet galaxies away to Thanos about the sould gem, great writing
there, true to the comics, NOT! Boy that sucked, I thought, why is this not at least Mephisto here or Lady Death, Red Skull, it's so bad I want to cry.
The Hulk was not really in the film, just the first few minutes, they just wanted to give the actor face time, so just had him jumping around in the Hulk buster outfit, yawn!This film is an insult to The Infinity Gauntlet Comics, go and read Thanos Quest, then The Infinity Gauntlet 1-6 and wait for this on normal TV.Totally ruined one of my favorite story lines, these writers need to get over themselves and not write it as if they think it's their creation, it's not!Best bit in the film for me, was Stan Lee's cameo!5/10 but should have been an easy 10.","6/10"
"Thor","MAYESY-44","1 September 2020","Absolutely brilliant from the MCU once you put everything together. It was initially painful having to wait a year after the end of infinity war but the film was brilliant. All the characters and different elements to the film. I could go on and on but 10/10 says enough.","3/10"
"Thor","milleniumlogan","3 May 2018","This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans. The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. 
Star-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy. Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot. Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene. Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense. Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie. Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth. Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU.","3/10"

"Thor","dmmsj0","6 May 2018","This film is disappointing, at best. Its plot is a series of battle set-pieces, in which a cast overstuffed with hero figures engage in pointless fights with an unbeatable enemy. The dialogue is throwaway, the scenes of human interaction brief and trivial, and the moral seems to be ""you can't win"". The ending is particularly offensive, because it violates the prime rule of narrative-- providing the viewer with a sense of closure. At the end (almost) everybody dies and then. . .The End.

But these never-ending franchise add-ons are pretty boring unless you're 12 or a CGI junkie. There's very little evidence of a story behind all of the mind-boggling action, over acted drama, and special effects. It drives me nuts anymore, when fighting takes a 5 minute 'time out' for a lame, ""poignant"" dialog scene. I guess that I've seen too many of these to enjoy them anymore.","3/10"
"Thor","searchingfortao","27 April 2018","I've watched every MCU movie at least twice. I love them all, even Iron Man 2, but this was terribly disappointing. This whole thing gave me the impression that the writers watched a lot of Game of Thrones and thought: ""I know what people like, let's kill a bunch of heroes!"" Even if the fight scenes devolved to the absurd, it didn't matter, we had good guys dying, so this would be a win.Now obviously it's a comic book movie, so it's a safe bet that most if not all of the heros they killed will somehow miraculously be resurrected, but that's not the point. I just paid ¬£12 to watch characters I fell in love with get murdered for 2 hours only to have it wrap up with half of everyone dying. Now I get to wait an entire year to find out how they're going to fix it.If I wanted to get punched in the stomach, I'm sure I could find someone to do it for less than ¬£12 and 2 hours of my time.","4/10"

If you'd done your job, there could have been legitimate reasons for failure, not just you writing ""even though their lives are at stake and they are seconds away from getting off Thanos's glove, let's have Chris's Pratt say 'No! I will not hold on one second and beat on him after you get the glove off, I will do it now!' because darn it, it's too tough to expect us to come up with a good reason they fail."" How about having some of Thanos's followers show up and prevent it? There are so many other problems with the last third, I swear it was written completely separate from the rest.

"Thor","tfminfl","13 January 2019","303. Avengers: Infinity War. Heres what I get... There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Droid army Vs the Naboo... only now it was Thermos' computer viruses Vs Wakanda... you're sayin that wasn't intentional? Filmbufftim on FB.","8/10"
"Thor","TheMovieDoctorful","14 November 2018","No matter what people think about me or my opinions, I wanted to like this film more than anyone. I love superheroes, I love Marvel and as much as I criticize the MCU for being safe and formulaic, there are several Marvel Cinematic Universe films that I've loved (The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the first 2 Captain America movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther to name the big ones). And I love that this movie enthralled and captivated many of my friends, a good number of them calling this one of their favorite movies of all time. However, the truth of the matter is that Avengers: Infinity War disappointed me. It deeply let me down. It's not an absolute failure and I certainly wouldn't call it irredeemable, but I can't say I find it to be a good film either.In terms of positives, the first one to come to mind would obviously be the jolly, purple giant himself, Thanos. He's undoubtedly one of the most interesting and developed villains in the MCU to date and he's acted phenomenally by Josh Brolin. I commend the creative team for keeping Thanos utterly despicable and villainous while still making him a compelling enough lead for us to be invested in his dark mirror of the Hero's Journey. It's fascinating to see an arc like this, full of sacrifice, struggle and personal loss concluding in an ultimate triumph, be translated to a villain without losing any of the qualities that keep him monstrous. He is a fully rounded, fully realized, human character; just not one who's a good person.As someone who hated Tom Holland's Spider-Man in both Civil War and Homecoming, I actually liked his performance and characterization here. The high stakes consequences of the story allow Holland to go to emotional places he simply wasn't allowed to before and his relationship with Tony Stark carries much more emotional weight, relatability and humanity to it than either of his previous two films. Maybe there's hope for this Spider-Man after all.Most (Keyword; most) of the content regarding the Guardians of the Galaxy is done wonderfully. Dave Bautista's Drax and Pom Klementieff's Mantis act wonderfully off of all the Avengers they get to interact with and it's nice to see that MCU teamup movies have moved and matured beyond thinking that every teamup movie needs all the team members to hate each other and fight over nonsense for 2 acts. Chris Pratt's performance as Starlord is truly heartbreaking and I commend the team behind Infinity War to have the guts to painfully strip away everything this character ever loved. For all my problems with the film, Starlord's emotional breakdown at Thanos after learning of Gamora's death is actually a major highlight of the movie for me. It's a deeply human and relatable moment that Pratt acts with such intensity and power.I also found myself really invested in the love story of Vision and Wanda. Elizabeth Olsen and Kevin Bettany have beautiful chemistry and their calm, soft moments before the storm bring a real gentleness and quiet beauty to the film. Scarlet Witch being forced to kill the only man she ever loved to save half the universe was by far the most emotionally powered moment of the movie and it's such a shame these two got so little screentime.That's the biggest problem of the film for me. Characters getting little screentime. Infinity War is deeply overstuffed, it has characters by the dozens and no idea what to do with a good half of them. Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Black Panther, the Hulk; all of these characters (As well as the side characters they're associated with) could be completely removed from the film and nothing would change. And yet, I'm supposed to feel the epic weight of their massive battle with the army of Thanos despite their importance to the story being minimal at best and non-existent at worst?The ending felt cheap to me rather than dramatic and emotional. The only deaths to really affect me were Vision and Spider-Man. The rest (Minus Gamora, whose death is too awkwardly edited and weirdly toned down from a violence standpoint to affect me until Starlord's reaction, and Loki, who has been seemingly killed and brought back to life so many times that I hardly buy he's finally dead) die with little to no reaction from their friends and comrades when that's exactly what we needed. We don't get to see Rogers react to losing both of his closest friends or the rest of the Guardians all dying together. It's all such blatant sequel baiting, especially with many of the characters (Including Loki) already having future MCU films or TV shows announced. Gee, I guess they're all just going to center on piles of sand, huh? This kind of sequel baiting conclusion is hardly ""new"" or ""bold"" or ""inventive."" In fact, it's pretty much what the MCU already did with Captain America: Civil War.Speaking of, as much as people want to give Guardians Vol. 2 crap for not balancing the comedy and drama well, where were your criticisms here? Towards a movie that starts making pop culture reference jokes almost immediately after Gamora's death, hardly even giving us a moment of mourning or reflection? A movie that hardly ever gives us a moment for pause for Thor to mourn Loki? I'm sure there was ambition in here somewhere, but in the end, everything got overpowered by the Marvel formula and tone for me.No, Infinity War isn't terrible, but I simply think it bit off more than it could chew. However, everything is set up for Part II to blow me away. I'm still holding out hope for this stage of the MCU to end in a high note for me.","10/10"
"Thor","hp-33729","6 August 2018","I'm not really a Marvel fan, but I did enjoy some of their movies and like some of their characters. Apparently this movie is a culmination of all the previous storylines in the Marvel universe, so this time they made sure to _really_ go over the top with it to please the fans. All your favorite characters are there doing their own thing to fight against the main villain in an end game that feels like it's 7 hours long. With so many characters and so many parallel storylines I found it hard to focus or care about anything and just tuned out, like when you're watching a very long battle in a Transformers movie that has no consequences whatsoever and the movie loses you and you start to ask yourself why you're not doing anything useful with your life instead of watching that nonsense.It's probably just me as I'm not really interested in this universe in general and the main villain is kind of disappointing in my opinion, but be warned, if you're not a die hard fan either, you will probably be bored to death just like me.","4/10"
"Thor","s3276169","30 July 2018","The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel. This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh. The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks ""all the same"". On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer. That said this film is what it is. I've seen it all before and I'd be hard pressed to want to see it all again. 5/10 from me.","1/10"
"Thor","haydenluz","13 August 2020","Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!","9/10"
"Thor","ryfin","8 November 2021","I adore this movie, and it is by far my favorite MCU movie. Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.","10/10"
"Thor","bora_mustafa","28 April 2018","I was really excited to watch this third Avengers movie, being that they were going all in with both the Avengers and the Guardian characters but ultimately the movie is just one big mess of a movie. The movie is more of a Thanos story which is fine as we need to know as much about this Titan, however the rest just didn't measure up.I understand getting some 30 characters together in one movie was always going to be a stretch, but I really didn't enjoy the movie. I won't delve into the plot as many reviewers have done so, I will just say that some of the action sequences were pretty good especially from Iron Man and Dr Strange, but ultimately the ending really agitated me and yes, we all know there will be another movie soon to complete this story but it just felt like a setup movie.Not as epic as everyone is making it out to be.

The power balance between characters strength and weaknesses seemed flawed. One character would be in peril from X weapon in one scene but then beat a more powerful weapon Y in another scene.

Not many were, though many of us knew several avengers and other major characters would die in this film, i did not expect it to be this many.This movie truly didn't waste any time getting down to business, as before ten minutes had passed, Heimdall and Loki are killed, and we see the Titan kick the crap out of Hulk, this set the tone for the entire movie right of the bat, and was IMO a smart move, now we knew for sure what a badass Thanos is, and this was before he got all the stones.What the Russo brothers have done here is to overdo themselves. Winter Soldier and Civil War are two of the best MCU movies to date, and you got to wonder how Marvel found these guys, and knew what they were capable of, because Infinity War just lifted the bar even higher. This movie is sort of Michael Bay's wet dream, this is what he wants to achieve, but never can because he has no idea how to tell a story or handle emotions. This movie is a 2 hour and 30 minute spectacle, which has action scene after action scene lined up, and it never feels too much, somehow they managed to balance it, and that is a feat not many directors can pull off.But also the music is masterfully composed, and fit every scene perfectly. And the costumes and props design are state of the art, everything looks and feels so right in this film, all the people involved has done an outstanding job.And i really have to give it to Josh Brolin. Thanos is easily the best villain i have seen in quite some time. He is a complex villain, that is so well portrayed i almost start rooting for him, and that is saying something come to think how many years i have grown to love the avengers and the guardians. This is also big thanks to the amazing cgi that just brings so much life into the character. I can understand his motivations, i can side with his thoughts, i both agree and i disagree at same time. Such a great character, easily the best MCU villain so far, and i had Loki as my favorite before him.At the end when Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Scarlett Witch, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Black Panther, Mantis, Bucky Barnes and many others are killed because he gets all the stones, i both felt a sense of pride for Thanos completing his mission, he truly is a determined badass. But at the same time i felt great sadness that so many of the characters that i loved, are dead.But MCU has killed characters before, which has been brought back to life, so i guess that will be the case here as well, as the next movie most likely will deal with time travel and fight Thanos in the future and the past. Dr.Strange gave up the time stone because of the 14.000.605 outcomes that he saw, only one lead to victory for the avengers, and giving up the stone was the beginning of the victory path. So even though this movie ended on a cliffhanger, it left enough hints that will be talked about for a whole year, and it will build the biggest hype in the history of cinema. So at the end of the day, this movie just delivers on so many levels, and it will make way for the rise of many new characters to enter the MCU, and finally take down Thanos and undo some of the damage he has done.It's quite amazing that this movie actually managed to live up to the hype, that should not even be possible when you think about it, but it did. The movie is absolutely amazing.I can't wait for Avengers 4.","1/10"
"Thor","brunovanael","21 January 2019","Jurassic Park, The Sixth Sense, Alien, Harry Potter and The Hangover are great movies. Putting all characters, realities and styles of these movies into one would probably result in a hidious thing, and that's what's wrong with this Avenger movie. There's too much of everything. More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.","2/10"
"Thor","tommy5677","29 September 2018","That's what you enter the theater with. Especially when you're going to see a Marvel movie. In this case not a single one was met. By the middle of the movie I found myself asking, where is it going and when is it going to get there.Three quarters in I found myself realizing it needed to be over. Every scene became a drag because that's what they did. On and on, one after another, with no endpoint. It was like the writer had a vision and then went blind.A simple plot that was easy to follow but it never seemed to develop. And you would think that in 2 1/2 hours you might get to know your characters a little. There was so much constant action and CGI, there was little or no time for that.If you enjoy being on the edge of your seat the entire time, this movie will do it for you because the action is never ending. A shining example of overdone CGI, lots of violence, and not enough time to tell if anyone can actually act.All of this nonsense to be left in the end with an incredible sense of loss. When I go to a superhero movie I want the superhero to win. In this case, The Avengers are nothing but a bunch of losers. And then there was the End Credits. They were giving credit to employees of the studios, like the CEO of Disney. WTF! This went on ad nauseum just like the movie itself. Don't waste your time waiting for the scene at the end, you'd be better off leaving the theater before the credits start to roll. 
In my opinion, this movie is an abysmal failure. Don't waste your 13 bucks on such trash.","2/10"
"Thor","warren-87235","20 September 2018","Having missed this at the cinema, my other half and I finally got round to buying and watching it (in 3D). Wow... what a mess. I'm glad we didn't pay to see this at the cinema. I'm quite honestly amazed at how many good reviews it's been getting. It's disturbingly close to 'Last Jedi' level bad (but not quite... that would still take some work). There's no real plot to speak of, things just seem to happen 'because', any sense of logic or consistency goes out the window (And that's in comparison to most of the other Marvel movies, which are hardly that great in the logic stakes in the first place!), power levels constantly change to fit a particular scene, rather than match what has been established for characters previously, etc., etc..... To top it all off, after all the build up, Thanos turns out to be one of the least interesting Marvel villains, with face-palm-inducing 'woke' motivation. The only good thing I'll say, is that it manages what most Marvel movies usually manage: the character interaction and banter is fun for the most part, and amusing. Oh, and most of the effects are good (except for Banner pointlessly in the Hulk-buster).I understand and applaud the desire to try an 'Empire Strikes Back', but there are a few big differences (A story, for one). Empire works so well because our heroes get their posteriors kicked. They struggle tooth and nail to survive, and even when they do get a chance to fight they are soundly defeated. Infinity War falls flat, because the villain and his forces never feel particularly strong, and our heroes get repeated opportunities to defeat Thanos and simply don't take them because it would end the film early.To be honest, despite its very obvious flaws (and a certain top lip deserving second billing), I actually found Justice League more enjoyable. I genuinely began falling asleep at the end of Inifinity War and closed my eyes, just listening till the end, I was so bored. Such a shame and a wasted opportunity after the build up of so many movies.","10/10"

"Thor","mikocot","11 May 2018","I am not a comics specialist and unlike most of the others I have no emotional connection to any of the hereos... so I might be biased.I have never expected much of a story line or intrigue from a movie solely based on the heroes presence, but being recommended as a revolutionary and number one of the series I hoped for at least a bit of cheap humor and great pictures.Yet, in the movie I've laughed twice, first time when Thor called raccoon a rabbit, and second time... when he did it again. The ending is surprising, especially for an American movie, but besides this the movie neither offers scenography comparable with Star Wars or Avatar nor any unique special effects.There is no consistency in action, power distribution or whatsoever. One minute the same character can die from a fist hit, the other he survives an explosion of the whole planet. Once he travels the space barefoot, the other he dies from being sucked from the ship. The colorful light goes back and forth but the evil character doesnt use any of his powers most of the time just to prolong the boring fights.Watching this movie is just distubring and frustrating.","10/10"

I absolute loved it and the end shocked me.
I went out of the cinema and couldn't believe it.

"Thor","tyrantlizardthad","19 August 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film so powerful and good that instead of being crushed by the weight of its expectations, it lifted them up and launched them out into space. Packed with epic, intense action, fantastic character work, and a powerful ending, it doesn't get much better then this. It's especially remarkable when you remember just how much buildup there was to this film and how massive the expectations were, you would think it would be almost impossible to meet, but Infinity War does it so well it makes it look easy.The story is exhilarating, it moves at a brisk pace which really makes you feel the immense stakes and how urgent the situation is. Every single character is handled extremely well and are all in character. The film makes sure to pay attention to what spot they're in in their character journey since the last film each respective character was in and continues their development. It maintains continuity and brings every character together in a way that's organic and serves the story perfectly. Tony Stark finally gets to fight the thing he has been tormented by and preparing for years to fight, Steve Rogers and most of the other Avengers are fugitives of the law and thus are more rugged, Bruce Banner is still dealing with his conflict with the Hulk (continuing what was established Thor: Ragnarok), Thor is dealing with the grief of losing everything, manifesting in personal vengeance towards Thanos, and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the characterization of Thanos, one of the best villains in cinema since Darth Vader from Star Wars (which was the intent of the Russos, specifically saying that the wanted to make ""the next Darth Vader""). He is a ruthless, insane and narcissistic monster, but he still has honorable traits, respects his enemies, he has a very flawed perspective of how to save the universe but believes it whole-heartedly, and even a fatherly love towards Gamora. He's terrifying but also humanized, and it just works perfectly.The computer generated effects, especially those that brought Thanos to life, are perfect, as is the soundtrack. While MCU scores are typically regarded as forgettable, Alan Silvestri's score for Infinity War is anything but. The performances are impeccable as well, there's not a single unsatisfying or uneven performance. Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Benedict Bumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Zoe Salanda as Gamora in particular stick out to me and knock it out of the park.In conclusion, Infinity War is the best MCU film and one of the best films to have come out in the past 10 years, and I don't think you could ask for more. Infinity War (along with its sequel, Avengers: Endgame) isn't just a movie, it's an experience.","5/10"

"Thor","pal05052003","29 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War manages to fix and upgrade superhero movies on many levels. First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.","3/10"
"Thor","jeller94","31 January 2024","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a triumph that flawlessly juggles the weight of its monumental narrative with moments of uproarious humor, delivering an exhilarating rollercoaster that earns a solid 9/10.From the outset, the film grabs your attention with a boldness rarely seen in superhero cinema. The stakes are sky-high, with the formidable Thanos looming as a threat of cosmic proportions. The Russo brothers showcase their directorial prowess, skillfully managing the massive ensemble cast and multiple storylines to create a cohesive and engaging narrative.What sets ""Infinity War"" apart is its audacious decision to give equal weight to its villain, Thanos. Josh Brolin's nuanced performance injects the Mad Titan with a formidable presence, and the exploration of his motivations adds layers to the character beyond the typical antagonist tropes. This bold approach elevates the film, creating a genuine emotional investment in the fate of the universe.The movie's big spectacle moments are nothing short of awe-inspiring. The visual effects are a testament to the technological prowess of the MCU, delivering jaw-dropping sequences that make full use of the cinematic canvas. The action is relentless, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats as heroes from across the galaxy unite in a battle of cosmic proportions.Marvel Studios strikes a perfect balance between gravitas and hilarity, infusing the film with the trademark humor that has become a hallmark of the MCU. The banter between characters adds a welcome levity to the intense situations, showcasing the camaraderie and chemistry built over years of interconnected storytelling.The plot's boldness is evident in its willingness to subvert expectations and take risks. The film doesn't shy away from exploring darker themes, resulting in emotionally charged moments that resonate long after the credits roll. The conclusion is both shocking and satisfying, leaving audiences eagerly anticipating the next chapter.In summary, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" stands tall as a testament to the MCU's ability to deliver a cinematic event of unparalleled magnitude. This epic superhero ensemble is a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike, showcasing the unparalleled storytelling and blockbuster entertainment that has become synonymous with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","1/10"
"Thor","pink_floydilia","10 February 2019","So to preface this review, let me start by saying I'm a massive Marvel fan. I've lived, breathed, written and read Marvel since I was eight years old.
The Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie. And to the masses, it was good. So hats off to them for making a crowd pleasing movie. But to the others who like some sense and substance when they pay good money to see a movie, try harder.","10/10"
"Thor","Mr-Fusion","29 April 2018","High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, ""Infinity War"" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color. But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result. If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly. I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction. And that's about it.6/10","10/10"
"Thor","comolgab","12 January 2019","Superheros are super because they do amazing things compared to the rest of us in this world. Here however, everyone does amazing things, always, for too long. It becomes boring. There is no normal world in the background to provide the contrast, it is one (long) fantasy tale. They're all ""super"" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still ""clunky"" and ""solid"". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character. Of course the movie is visually striking, but again, from the first scene to the last: I got used to the visuals after about 20 minutes, the rest felt to me like repetition.","3/10"

If you love these characters, were hooked on the previous movies, *don't.*

This movie is not like the others, and honestly, does not show much screen time for most the characters.
It is much more violent and emotional than the previous films, but more than that, it is extremely disturbing.
Basically, if you feel obligated to view it for your favorite characters, just beware, there's not much screen time for them, so don't push yourself, or feel like you have to do it.
Also, I would definitely NOT take kids to see this, as the movie has a very dark and disturbing atmosphere to it.","10/10"

"Thor","olgavalentovaov","30 April 2018","This movie has certainly made history. A film that has so much going on and still manages to be boring just has to be some sort of a record. I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there).
Also, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot.
And to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay. We don't need another character up in here, we really don't. And especially not Carl Manvers.
Not worth the cash, not worth the hype, not worth another word.","7/10"

Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some ""plot holes"" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers","1/10"

"Thor","oliverdimitri","26 April 2018","Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.","3/10"
"Thor","JayDeeezy","10 October 2021","This film knocked it out of the park and will go down in history. Seeing our heroes crossover was done very organically and led to a fun and thrilling path. The story was unpredictable, had an unexpected main character and the ending was perfect.","1/10"
"Thor","nicar127","13 May 2018","Kill kill kill. Death. That's what this movie is about. To their credit, the actors in this film were all great, despite each being given minimal screen time, with near zero character development. There are just too many characters and angles, each with the same ultimatum: KILL. (They are all trying to kill the villain Thanos, of course, but it's still Kill Kill Kill!)I never felt any passion for any of them until Gamora was thrown to her death by her POS step dad Thanos. When we see movies we want to feel the passion of the characters we are watching. None existed until this moment. My favorite character in this film is Peter Quill. Way to go Chris Pratt. He brought depth and passion, sorrow and love, to his role. He is the stand out in this film. I cried when he cried. I was pissed off when he was pissed off. Peter Quill / Star Lord was the sole representative of human emotion in this film. And he did it well.On the technical note, Thanos just looks like a cartoon character.
(No offense, Josh Brolin, you were GREAT as Thanos!!)
CGI always looks fake. I watched the entire movie imagining the ""green screen"" behind all of them. In a few years, actors won't be needed at all.Iron Man could have just gotten a huge eraser to erase Thanos The Cartoon.
Have a great summer!","10/10"

"Thor","dezsokekovacs","28 April 2018","If you like to watch for 2.5 hours how your heroes get beaten and even killed then this movie is for you, otherwise it will not entertain you. 
At the beginning Thanos has only one Infinity Stone but at the end he has all the stones and therefore he snap his fingers, half of the population dies (Avengers included) and ... THE END!
This means that there are 5 fights for the 5 stones and Thanos wins all the fights by beating and/or killing the Avengers.All MCU movies structures are the same. They are split in 2 parts: in the first half the heroes get beaten and the villain wins all, but when all hope is gone it start the second half when the heroes recover from their wounds and they win (almost every time) with a big ""idiotic"" bam.
The Avengers: Infinity War is the first half. I think it will be entertaining to watch it when the Avengers 4 will come out (just like The fellowship of the ring + The two tower). It's very likely that in Avengers 4 they will use the time stone to reverse the time to resurrect the dead Avengers. Or maybe another stone (honestly I don't really know what they can do) but the resurrection is for sure.Bottom line: this movie is watchable if you see it only once. But to watch several times how your heroes get killed means that you need therapy.PS: When Dr. Strange looked into the future to find a positive solution, he found only ONE from millions of possibilities and they didn't used it. Why? Or they used it but Strange didn't saw in the future that Peter Quill is coming?","10/10"
"Thor","sergew","18 May 2018","I'm tired of the comic based movie genre which further signals the death of original scripts and content. Don't get me wrong, originality alone does not make a good story. This movie continues to try squeeze water from a rock and I leave wanting so much more. The movie was much too long and especially the fight scenes. As in the old Wendy's commercial, ""Where is the beef?"", or in my case a good story and characters I care about.","2/10"
"Thor","adeckofcards","25 July 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.
In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.
It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.
'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","1/10"

There is a huge amount of holes, henny. The chemistry between actors (hence acting) is non-existent. All that we get - is a portion of idiotic choices just to excuse the upcoming ""ACTION"". Ye, baby, gimme more... These sweet fireworks and a talking piece of purple CGI is all I need.

"Thor","ocr-94520","10 May 2018","It totally wasn't how i expected it to be. It's just a silly film with only action. Many cringy dialogues and dumb moments ruined the film. I felt really bad when yondu died in GOTG 2 but in this film never felt anything for anyone. So many died but i don't know why this film was in a rush and that's why their death didn't made me feel bad for them. They should have increased the runtime of the film. One of the worst thing is characters were not balanced. Captain america hardly had any dialogue. Hulk was shown only for 30 seconds in the entire film. There were many ways to stop thanos but hey he should look badass so let's make heroes dumb. Cgi was okay but in many places it looked cartoon-ish. In one scene it looked like Mark ruffalo's face is pasted on hulk buster. The film is full of plot holes.","3/10"
"Thor","Shakor77","18 July 2018","To a certain degree most super hero movies are pointless as they are mainly about beings with super powers and in flamboyant costumes duking it out at each other. And, seeing as I grew up reading super-hero comics, that is just fine.However, without getting into any spoilers, this movie could have ended the first minute as the end-result would have been the same as watching the whole thing for 2+ hours. So I guess you could say that this game was a setup for the next Avengers movie, which seems to have become the norm these days.But disregarding that, there are a number of other weak points in this movie such as:Hulk was a massive disappointment and made his weakest contribution so far of any Avengers movie. And it was never explained why.Vision was another disappointment as apparently the Black Widow, who has no super powers, could hold her own against someone who was mopping the floor with Vision.Some young girl in Wakanda, who I never heard of in the comics, is apparently more intelligent than both Bruce Banner and Tony Stark as she came up with a solution, in about 5 minutes after been presented with the problem, that those other two hyper-intelligent people could not come up with. I suppose that is because of feminism?Loki made a very uncharacteristic choice which quickly made him irrelevant in this movie. Why then even have him in the movie to begin with?Dr Strange, who was pretty good in the movie, didn't seem to stand much of a chance against a Thanos henchman but apparently could go toe to toe with Thanos himself?Thor was easily swept aside by Thanos, in the beginning, yet by the end seemed to be the only one who could actually defeat Thanos, just because he had a weapon. Yet in Thor: Ragnarok Odin suggested that Thor, was more powerful than Odin and did not need any weapons as he said: Are you Thor: son of Hammers? I could go on and on but this is basically a very nice action movie with some great performances from actors such as Josh Brolin as Thanos. But don't think too deeply about it as it is just an action movie and not much more.","10/10"
"Thor","aj_gr8","2 May 2018","I mean I don't get it why this movie came in the top 250 movies in IMDb. I am not saying that this is a bad movie but the best super hero movie ever? People have just have just made up their minds that it's avengers so it must be a very good movie. The pervious avengers movie were better than this one. In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.","1/10"
"Thor","three_dead_crows","5 May 2018","In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. 
 
The day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel. After watching this movie I feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure Peter Quill is, just like they did with Danny Rand in the defenders.","1/10"

So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!","9/10"
"Thor","DaytonaBob","17 January 2019","The movie was mostly a lot of CGI and a lot more fighting. ALL neat to watch. BUT the idiocy of believing there are a handful of little stones that control the ENTIRE UNIVERSE? All the neat outer space scenes and strange alien landscapes all of that.BUT to say he would be able to control the ENTIRE Universe?I am sorry but that is beyond ridiculous.I am huge Marvel fan and can actually say I have been reading Marvel since FF#4. And at one time had almost every single issue of the comics they put out until the mid 70s. They were great fun.This movie on the other hand is silly. One person with a handful of stones controls the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.Do the writers at Marvel et al have any clue as to the size of the universe and that is just what we have been able to see? The bazillions and gazillions of GALAXIES, the number of planets would be a ONE followed by millions of zeros. The amount of beings, and all sorts of life forms would be a One followed by a number of zeros so large it is unfathomable.I would have bought say, the galaxy. But this stupidity of the entire universe was just that.Seriously lame. Silly and beyond any sense of rational thought. YES it is comics and just a movie but the primary belief in how to enjoy a movie is the SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Sorry, NO. And on top of that it all centered around a small planet in one of the arms of the Milky Way closer to the edge of the end of the arm than otherwise. Really? HOW did we get so lucky in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.We are supposed to believe the Thanos character would have the ability to wipe out half of that? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAI love Marvel but this should have been an insult to anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together. Oh well I hope we don't get a conclusion that reminds me of an old Saturday Morning serial of Jungle Jim where at the end of the episode where we had to come back next Saturday to that theater to find out how he got out of the predicament of being caught in a HOLE half way done and below him were lions ready to tear him apart and above him were natives ready to rip him apart and cook him.So how did he get out of it? Well Next Saturday's episode started with the voice over stating: ""After Jungle Jim got out of his last trap he headed towards the nearest village"" Seriously that is how they did it.So are we going to get either this was an alternate universe?
A dream that when one of them gets out of the shower his wife says I had the strangest dream?
Or .....? ""Thanos you bad boy, Where have you been? Your father and I have been looking all over dozens of universes. Now you put things right or you are going to get such a paddling when we get back to home!""Thanos: ""Aw gee mom you never let me have any fun""This will be the only interesting part is what silliness they use to restore the universe to its natural order minus some nutjob like Thanos.Gods above and below that was an awful movie but it was cool to see all the Superheroes in one movie.. So glad I could watch it at home and fast forward through all the fighting.BUT ya gotta hand it to the fanboys who have posted it was the greatest cinematic effort in the history of the world. And the one guy who said anyone who says differently then IMDB should immediately pull the review and probably publicly flog the person who wrote it.","8/10"

You could really empathize with the characters and feel the urgency and dread as time ticked away.The MCU was a powerhouse before this film, and the film cemented its place in pop culture. Even if you haven't seen the movie, you've likely heard of and know what film is being referenced when someone says, ""the snap.""Ensemble pieces really hinge on the chemistry between the cast, and everyone here played so well with each other's characters, it was a real treat to watch.

"Thor","myema77","17 May 2018","Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates.
Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find?
You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered:
Slick action and stunning visuals.
The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here. Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond.With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie.
The story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing.
(The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner)
The supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe.
 On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn.
Thano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing! Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life.As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this. Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie?
Opinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie.Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme.2 stars, one for Tom Holland and the other for Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.","1/10"
"Thor","Lewis_Heather787","28 April 2018","What did I just watch???? To be honest I don't think I can process everything and I'm not such if that is a bad thing or a good thing. To get it out there straight away I'm not a die hard fan of these films actually if anything I've losing more and more interest in the MCU as its gone on. I'm not quite sure why, just a lot of them are not for me but I can see why general audience love them, they are vey appealing. Positives.The Russo brothers were given an almost impossible task and that was to bring together a huge amount of characters in one film and tell a cohesive story that works. For the most part I think they have achieved that, the directing of the film is faultless and is a real achievement considering the number of things that could go wrong with a film like this. Personally though I would put it behind ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"" for the Russo's , those films have less problems than this one.The cast for the most part is good, I cant mention them all because there are so many however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly and I'm really shocked to be saying this, the best character in the film for me is Doctor Strange. Now I personally didn't like the character in he is own film, but thats another story, in this film he is the heart and plays an important role. Acting from Cumberbatch is obviously going to be great, but I was blown away by how good he really was. There is a fantastic fight scene between him and Thanos on his own, wow. The other standout is Thor, Hemsworth again knocks it out of the park and has really cool scenes towards the end of the film which are worth the wait. The others are all really good as well for the most part, but those two definitely stood above the rest. NegativesThis is where this review gets a unhelpful mark because it goes against the consensus of this film. For me there are four main negatives film the film, ok bare with me. Firstly its the same old same old problem I personally have with the MCU and that is the dreaded humour. Extremely cringeworthy at times and once again far to much of it especially with the Guardians, which also really don't like. I know Im in the minority on this, and I have no problem in people thinking this is the best part of the film its just not for me. 
The humour of the film links to the next negative and that is the tone of the film, which to say the least is all over the place. One second we have cringeworthy jokes and the next second its all trying to be serious. I think the Russo's really struggled with this element of the film because the humour and jokes undermine the seriousness. Do one or the other??
The third negative is the end which is a complete joke right? The end was looking at first glance to be a fantastic emotional punch and shocking end to some characters. However instead they decide to ""kill"" off characters that we pretty much know for the most part will be back for the next Avengers film next year. Marvel have already announced sequels and other solo films for characters like Black Panther, Spiderman and maybe even Doctor Strange. So their deaths are meaningless and carry no weight, brings up the question what is the point in the whole film really when we know a reasonable amount of it is going to be reversed in the next film.(I could be wrong)
The final small negative is the length of the film which is far too long, the film does definitely drag in some parts.Overall the film is probably just about good enough for 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, when the film is good it is very enjoyable and good to watch however I have my reservations. They are mainly my own fault and I'm definitely in the minority when it comes to them. However I'm wondering whether even the most die hard fan is not a little disappointed with this film like hasn't this been 10 years in the making. Finally if you like these types of films you will absolutely love it however if your not to bothered like me then you might not enjoy it as much.","1/10"
"Thor","Vartiainen","21 June 2018","Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something.So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring.The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more.Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending... We will be talking about that ending for decades to come.","1/10"
"Thor","CubsandCulture","12 December 2018","Everything about this movie was portrayed as bigger and more. Bigger Action! More heroes! The problem with that eventually more becomes less and the story collapses under its own weight. That happens here but not as much as I expected. The final film is coherent so there's that. It is also largely fun. There's that too. However, there is still too many sequence of the same stuff (get the stone!) and a lot of the film is very unwilling to play with the world it has set-up. Of note Dr. Strange and Thanos (post reality stone especially) are far too punchy. You can change the fabric of reality. Why do you insist on just punching people?A film like this lives, or this case disappoints on its villain. Thanos is OK as a villain. He is played well by Brolin. How he is written leaves much to be desired. His radical environmentalism simply doesn't connect with anything that is actually happening in the world today. It makes the film feel insular and escapist in the wrong way. Moreover, the logic of the character requires him to be either a eugenicist or a ""eat the rich"" radical; the screenplay does neither. The writers try to split the different by applying the big moment randomly. (but somehow random means 1/2 of each significant couple among the heroes). It simply doesn't work. It is not chilling. It is not human. It is silly.The deaths (""deaths"") are overdone. I simply do not believe Disney is going kill off a bunch of Golden Geese. It simply doesn't have any emotional weight because too many characters that have sequels in the works ""die."" The ending only gets a hearty chuckle from me.This film is fun. It moves and most of the action is good. But it is shallow, hollow and expects us to forget how capitalism works.","10/10"

Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie.

"Thor","jandrfilms","9 December 2021","Anything that has to do with the Avengers, Marvel comics in general, I'm there with bells and whistles on. Love these types of movies, like I said, I'm a comic book geek.The scenes were outstanding, Thanos fighting all of the Avengers and then some who wasn't Avengers joined in to beat this evil foe. I just hated in how it ended the death of Tony Stark (aka Iron Man). Now for me, I wasn't much of a Robert Downey Jr. Up until his role as Iron Man, loved the way he brought some intelligence to the role of Tony Stark as well as humor to. I just hated that they had to kill him off.Maybe Dr. Strange can go back to that moment and change the coarse of history and still keep the ending the same, by allowing Tony Stark to live but still killing off Thanos...hmm, interesting concept, HEY MARVEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?","8/10"
"Thor","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","10 June 2018","I know I'm extremely late to the party, but I waited for a time to sync up and see it with a friend (we both have too many obligations in the education realm), plus I had to see Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok beforehand.Now before I leave any impressions, know that my experience was dampened by students with a moronic goal of sabotage by deciding to blurt out anything about the film they knew that I wouldn't want to know. I mean... what can I do to them in retaliation? Fail them? Strike them down with the hammer of Thor? Nothing, they're untouchable and they know it. It's sad, and I thought I've taught them to be better than that. Unfortunately, that select few is out there and always will be. I've waited nearly thirty years of my life for a film of this impactful magnitude to come out in its respectful genre, and individuals half of my age decide to play the card of indecency upon me and essentially impede on the level of my viewing experience.All that being said... it was a very good film, even better than I liked it (the problem was the spoilers). In fact, if I were to list negatives for this film, it would really just be all in one lump-sum bullet point regarding the lack of grounded material: a lot of space related stuff, nanotechnology (and I really don't like the Iron Spider compared to regular ol' Spider-Man), whims of inexplicable magic sources, levels of seemingly unbeatable friends and foes where I don't understand the devastation of a punch or explosion onto the individual taking the blow, and the recurring MCU element of death not necessarily being a finality for characters' ends.Conversely, there were many things that I really appreciated about the film. The first thing I would like to mention was the balance of everything, starting with the balance of characters and their moments. I thought this was going to be a massive issue going into this film, where it would just be one endless action battle and people wouldn't be able to serve their parts correctly, or they would only serve aspects as a moment of convenience to further the plot. Instead, where everyone was at during any moment seemed very natural to the overall MCU progression of items, and interactions that were had (on top of some that have yet to occur, lying in wait for the fourth Avengers film) were nicely played out. Villain encounters even appeared late in the film, which is kind of nice so that the legend looms larger as the movie goes on instead of playing beats such as: ""We need three fights between hero and villain, so let's spread them out."" Even characters who are physically inferior weren't just suitably matched up with other characters of that nature, and instead they found a way to possibly hold their own or team up to make things equal enough so that the fights could be anywhere with anyone. None of this works just in script alone; this was done by the hands of great directing. The Russo Bros have found a way to serve this great kind of balance for two straight films, though in Civil War it really felt a little more like: ""Let's force the issue and get everyone on screen at once, even in a bit of a friendlier brawl."" Admittedly some characters miss the boat of even appearing in the film, but it was few and far between, and they are explained away where frankly it worked just fine.Another great form of balance was in the light versus dark emotional moments. I have been on Marvel for having too many lighthearted moments in their films, or really too much levity for the sake of entertaining the crowd on their first viewing of a film. They really pushed the envelope with Thor: Ragnarok, and honestly I was not appreciative of it. They needed to find a way to strike the right balance of when to say what and what surface level of comedy they need to inject during the characters given the moments, but most importantly every light moment needs to be balanced with a dark moment for emotions to hit the right heartstrings. Infinity War does exactly that. I wasn't eye-rolling when they injected humor, and only one or two comedic bits were out of place for the moment they were in. That is a fair price to pay for the overall structure. They had enough characters to find those moments with in the 160-minute running time, and for once they didn't have the villain(s) either be demoted to that same level of yuck-yucks nor did they subject them to another character's comedic relief as a way to actually victimize them.This is a great time to transition to this film's villain: Thanos. I have had my quips with MCU villains being rather underserved in scope compared to that of the larger picture at play, like where they may be more of a pawn so the rest of the chessboard could do its thing. Thanos, however, appears as the king of this universe's chessboard. He was the main character in this film, and probably had the most screen time. He was not just a villain seeking ultimate domination of everything for the sake of it, he has his own goals and purposes in an attempt to restore a harmonious balance (there is that world again) for all species. It was not only believable, but it was also sympathetic. He shows remorse for his (attempted) actions, he shows mercy to those who beg for it so long as they aid in furthering his cause, and he speaks with a level head in a way that if we haven't already had eighteen other MCU films liking our heroes so much that we would actually root for the bad guy here. Definitely the best served comic book villain in a decade, if not right alongside the Joker for 'overall' status. Granted, Heath Ledger has given us the performance of a lifetime, though that character is very one-dimensional (and really good at that dimension, no doubt). Thanos really surprised me that he was more than just a large purple alien wanting ""MOAR.""I want to give the directors credit for making an extremely long running time feel extremely short. I don't know if I'm sitting here saying that I'd like to watch a whole 'nother hour of the film, but they hit the right beats and paced it so evenly that they really made time fly by in a manner that other films really can't speak for in the same vein. For all the movies I own on Blu-ray, I sometimes stop short of watching something that runs this long because I tell myself: ""This is a long film man, you are going to be devoting a lot of time to this."" I don't think I'll be saying that about Infinity War. If I were to show this to a friend who hadn't seen it yet, I wouldn't be warning them about the duration of it nor would I fear they would be looking at their watch every fifteen minutes wondering when it would end. The more you get into the film, the more you lean forward on the edge of your seat. Yes, sometimes they do cut away from characters to get to others because they have to, but you never forget your place where others are at and you aren't dismayed at the next grouping's story line. It all worked so very, very well.I'll cap this off with one thing that wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be, and it was in the movie's action. There was nothing wrong with it, but outside of some last-act battles I wasn't ever really wowed by anything either. All visual effects were top-notch, though (ehem, Ragarok was not good here too). I do think I'm putting this on a relative scale though, because it's interesting that I say that looking back at the whole picture that I think the moments outside of the action were actually better than the action points themselves, not in terms of entertainment but just in overall value. That's a good thing too, so now you're not just sitting around waiting to be getting your money's worth again. This jumps back to how the film's length is not a concern. No action scene overstays its welcome either, or it has enough dynamic elements and cross-cutting that it fits properly (again, jumping back to Civil War, that airport scene was just way too contrived... this doesn't have that). Age of Ultron was much more of a popcorn flick for me that I really do enjoy, and The Avengers has all of its lasting appeal in the final third of the film when they all assemble together, so I think I can say this one is the most consistently put together.Overall, I would say that my experience was definitely a great one and it is likely hitting inside my Top 3 of all the MCU films (The Winter Soldier still wins). I'm not ready to officially rank it just yet and I still have a lot of questions about what I saw in this one, but again that's a good thing about this film's natural depth where I'll have to watch it more than once to understand and appreciate those items. I really think the thing that brings this movie down a notch was my experience because of spoilers beforehand, and I didn't want to believe many of them to be true but unfortunately many were. This is a movie that I even avoided watching trailers for. Any knowledge about an event I am already interested in does not help ramp up the hype by me learning more about it. Shame on them for doing that to my theatrical viewing, but thankfully this film did not only rely on its spoiler-bound moments to be as good as it was. It was very ambitious, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next because I really have no idea where they want to go from here.","9/10"
"Thor","attila-698-252301","21 May 2018","I wish I could have my 2.5 hours back. The film was over-long and packed with way too much violence for what it delivered as entertainment. It also spent too much time focusing on the villain and his rationalizations for genocide. I found myself wondering if such indulgences would seem inappropriate to dwell on for a real mass murderer like Rudolf Hoess, why is it appropriate dramatically for Thanos? 
Answer: It's not. This film was easily the worst Marvel film I've seen.","9/10"
"Thor","viithtrump","26 May 2018","Marvel's biggest issue in my opinion is that there is just too much to take from comics, as it is a giant cluster mess. There is so many marvel characters now that some are just not that great and they shouldn't exist. Black panther is a yawn, and same with the second iron man (pure stupid, along with a 3rd in Banner? Are you kidding me right now?) and new younger spiderboy (even more dumb), which I feel shouldn't be in this series. Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful. I really think they are headed for clash with like Galactus and other bigger enemies and when Fox is bought out by Disney it will lead to the Xmen joining too, gets bigger and worse. Good luck.","5/10"

"Thor","highmarksreviews","29 April 2018","""Avengers"": Infinity War"" is an epic unlike any other. It's a reminder of how far the MCU has come in 10 years and this movie capitalises on its bloated, but beloved cast to draw you in. Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.","1/10"

And it doesn't matter if you don't remember your last visit after a day or two, there's no correlation. Wether it's shapeless, explosive, dripping, ludicrous or misleading, it always ends with the feeling that there could have been more. But even if you try harder for another minute, there's only void. And as soon as you stand up, the whole stuff is flushed out of our memory. Only persists a reminiscence of nauseating miasma.

"Thor","Pjtaylor-96-138044","29 April 2018","'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10","10/10"
"Thor","danjstanley","6 May 2018","I don't typically write reviews; however, someone needed to balance out the over the top love for this bad plotted film with way too many stars. For me, it all comes down to this question:
""Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?"" The answer is NO! 
I know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. 
Then, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.","4/10"

"Thor","AdrenalinDragon","26 April 2018","I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too.I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to 
focus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it. The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations.9.5/10","5/10"
"Thor","arthuradam","5 May 2018","If I am to get to the point, the movie was noisy audibly and visually. It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. 
There's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. 
Too much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other.
Wakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now.
Anyhow, there are some good parts in the movie, but it's rushed and just awful. I preferred Justice League as a movie; the pacing was a lot better.","5/10"
"Thor","Lord_of_the_Things","29 June 2020","I understand why Marvel fans like this movie, but I wasn't impressed.From first scene to last it is just bang, bang, crash, smash, bang! The story is very weak and there is zero character development. Maybe the characters were already fully developed over the previous 30+ movies and hence why so little attention given here.I'm just not invested in the series and so don't find the Avengers movies to be much of a pay off, but get why others do. Personally, I found it to be an exhausting, unrewarding experience.I still gave it 7/10 for its appeal to the fans, but possibly 5 or 6/10 for myself.Recommended for the fans, not anyone else","9/10"
"Thor","Floated2","12 March 2019","Avengers: Infinity War has become a massive box office success and occasional worldwide phenomenon. Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous.Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Overall Infinity War does offer much different occurrences, a lot if characters and a lot going on.Though one can't help feel that it wasn't as great as advertised.

"Thor","Film_star","27 April 2018","I have rated this 5 stars, predominantly because I think 9s and 10s should be provinces reserved for truly great movies. This is an entertaining one, which kept me interested for most of its overlong running time, but which won't leave me with much lingering sense of a tangible movie - it felt like a solid episode in a series I'm binge-watching, but I'll struggle to treasure many specifics of this movie from a line-up of Marvel titles.There are a ridiculous number of characters in this; the film is using that as its ""event"" selling point, but in truth it was the factor which made me most apprehensive before watching it. To the filmmakers' credit, the juggling of storylines and superheroes (and their endless sidekicks and sub-teams) was almost impressive - it never felt as though many were shoehorned too awkwardly into the forward trajectory of the overall narrative, though some characters - including leading players like Spider-Man and Black Widow - inevitably get shortchanged.The series' most rewatchable movies - for me Avengers, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Ragnarok and Black Panther - all have something compelling that feels unique to them. I'm not sure this has a unique selling point beyond a huge cast jostling for billing position on the poster, but whilst it plods along it's perfectly decent, and fans of the franchise will likely lap it up.At the time of writing, the film is ranked number 10 on the IMDb list of the Top 250 movies OF ALL TIME. I'm certain it will plummet once the general public start to supersede the fanboy rush, but this kind of kneejerk over-ranking in the context of cinematic history is a nonsense.","10/10"
"Thor","austin0731","25 April 2018","Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody.Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment.Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable. But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.","1/10"

"Thor","namashi_1","29 April 2018","The sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 'Avengers: Infinity War', which assembles almost ALL of its Superheroes in one single film, is the biggest Marvel Blockbuster to date. Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story. 'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course!But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc.That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure!Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch! Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts.On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.","9/10"
"Thor","coreyjdenford","26 April 2018","This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free***** (5/5)IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock. Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron ""I'll do it myself"" and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin. How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage. Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them?Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait. VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.","1/10"

"Thor","frank_kneepkens","3 August 2018","Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that ""I don't understand"" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!","4/10"

You will cry from pleasure, you will cry from epicness and you will definitely cry from heartbreaking scenes. Ten years of building, leading to this MASTERPIECE!I guess you want to know something about Thanos. Well, he is the ultimate villain, I mean he is menacing. Every speech that he got, gives you chills, his movements, his motivation, hands down the best villain!The interactions between the different fractions of heroes is magnificent. The first time you see Guardians and Thor, Iron Man and Guardians, Strange and Spidey it's just awesome! The chemistry between them is incredible.The story is told incredibly. The waiting for this movie, the hype, everything is worth it. Actions scenes especially some....are jaw dropping, you gonna shake your head and you will be not able to stay on your seat calm. The music combined with the scenes, like I said MASTERPIECE...this movie is out of this world.Russo Brothers just strike again! The visuals are so well done too. There is no way to catch every single detail on the first viewing, also the movie deserves multiple viewings again and again and again...and I'm not even joking.On purpose I do not want to give you absolute any spoilers. I want you to enjoy the movie by yourself. I believe any real fan will be happy with the result of ten years gradation and like me, will got no words.","1/10"
"Thor","jhalcollege","3 June 2018","In linear algebra, a matrix is said to be rank deficient if one of its rows or columns can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows or columns. In layman's terms, this particular part adds nothing new to the overall picture, it just uses information that is already present.This happens to be the defining characteristic of Infinity War, there's nothing new here. What there is is a lot of action, a lot of CGI, and lots of bad jokes with a few okay ones tossed in the mix (exactly what Marvel has been doing for ten years).The film makes a half decent effort to distinguish arch-villian Thanos from the rest of the baddies, and its kind of succeeds on a minimal level. But in the end, he's just another world conquering fiend who's bigger and stronger than everyone else (Steppenwolf from Justice League?) who is set off to collect some arbitrary artifacts.Another issue is comes as a side effect of putting so many established characters in. Take Captain American for example, a character whose driven by morals, and whose films are relatively serious, and the Guardians of the Galaxy (about as serious as Looney Tunes). They've done fine on their own, but put them in the same scene and it just doesn't work. At this point, if you're not sick and tired of Avenger's Universe, then good for you. But for the rest of us, one thing's for sure, haters are definitely going to hate this one.(If you're not familiar with the IMDb rating formula, you should check it out. While Infinity War rests at an 8.8 at the time of this writing, it will drop reasonably over time as more casual viewers watch the film, and rate it the four or five it deserves.)","2/10"

His character is what we in the gaming world would call OP (Over Powered). How does destroying 50% of all life in the universe bring balance? The whole blasted plot was based on that silly premise! I am pretty sure I need to blame some obscure writers at Marvel for this ridiculous plot and character. The entire movie makes a mockery of science and even science fiction. Spoiler: The idea that you could collect 6 stones (which were created during the Big bang) and then snap your fingers to wipe out 1/2 of all life EVERYWHERE in the known (and probably unknown as well) universe takes witchcraft, sorcery and the supernatural to levels beyond anything within reason. Now where do you go Disney? You gave us a worst case scenario and any future villains will be mild by comparison.

It had some good action but made no logical sense! A good movie must make good sense. First, Hulk is so toned down that Thanos didn't even employ any of the stones to beat him! In less than a minute he knocks Hulk out! ""We have a Hulk"" is so meaningless right now. Then Banner is forced into and kept in an iron man suit. Agrhhhh! Thanos is so hyped that he shouldn't be beaten even in part 5. How is it that Dr Strange never used the time stone? Then Iron Man and Spiderman (humans) are able to breathe freely on Titan?Also annoying, Vision is carried about like a baby, limp and powerless. You just wonder whether it's the same vision that was so powerful in Civil War and could walk through walls. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting the Avengers to win Thanos in this part since it's a 2-part movie but let's put it this way; the avengers were humiliated! Probably should have been called - Avengers: Thanos the powerful.Waste of 2+ hrs for me.","5/10"

"Thor","classicsoncall","5 September 2018","Compared to the first two Avengers movies, I've rated this one a solid '9' against a pair of '7's' for the other two. The prequels felt more like getting the most out of all the destruction that the super-heroes could inflict on their cosmic adversaries. That formula's still at work here but it seemed a lot fresher with the team-up between The Guardians and The Avengers, while Thanos (Josh Brolin) brought a decidedly different dimension to his role as an intergalactic enforcer. Some might even call his mission honorable, in as much as he wants to save the universe with his philosophy that ""If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist"". Fresh on the heels of ""Thor:Ragnarok"", the Marvel and Disney folks do well here to keep the humor in place while dramatic events unfold throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth)/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) dynamic was especially played well, and it was a hoot to see Thor accept Rabbit's, er..., Rocket's (voiced by Bradley Cooper) claim as captain of the Guardians. Where the film loses a point for me has to do with the inconsistency with some of the principal characters. Depending on which prior movie you care to cite, Thor and Doctor Strange have been positioned as the most powerful entities in the Marvel universe. However here, they were dispatched rather handily in the early going by Thanos's minions. There's also the quite literal overkill that occurs near the end of the story with the disintegration of heroes like Black Panther, Doc Strange and Spidey, along with the entire Guardian team. You know they have to make a come back in the follow up sequel(s), so it seemed like an almost cheap attempt to elicit pathos from the audience. By my count, at least fourteen Marvel characters met their demise in the story if you include Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner in the after credits scene.Once again, and I can't help it, but kudos to Stan Lee, Marvel comic writer and originator of many of these characters, for his bus driver cameo near the beginning of the picture. His one line was particularly apropos: ""What's the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?""And oh yes, don't want to forget this little tidbit. There have been any number of movies with scenes set in New York City in which the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are in prominent view prior to the events of 9/11, but in this flick, there's a quick glimpse offered of the new One World Trade Center rising from the city skyline. I thought that was very cool, and even better that it wasn't in the path of the New York City dust up.","10/10"
"Thor","skam_platform","4 September 2021","I love this film, it has the correct balance of all the ingredients. For the people saying this is better than Endgame, I suppose so, but I look at it as a Kill Bill type situation. They are parts one and two of the same film and as such should be viewed as a whole. Infinity war has so much bang for your buck that Endgame if compared it way flatter, but really they are Cause and effect, setup and resolution.Brilliant, vibrant, funny, highly entertaining and unpredictable stuff.","3/10"
"Thor","gradyharp","18 August 2018","Louder, Longer, Less plot - Groot has the best tool: an iPod..........
There is an audience (and a massive one willing to pay big bucks and stand in long lines ) who champion all of the Marvel Comics films. AVANGERS INFINITY WAR is no exception. At over two and a half hours even the huge cast of gifted actors - at their bet when being funny - explode, blow up things, zoom into outer space for a mission to find Thanos who goal is to rule the universe by obtaining all the funky jewels for his glove - all seem to wear thin from the plodding 'plot' and turn to dust. The true 'stars' of this huge effort are f course the CGI team - the special effects are truly spectacular, at least for the first hour. The characters don't get much time to develop but the actors assigned to the strange roles make the Avengers and their enemies entertaining. The 'plot'? 'As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.'Cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Vin Diesel, Benecio Del Toro, Chris Pratt, William Hurt, Josh Brolin, Gweneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper etc etc etc.

It's still one of the best superhero movies ever made. Thanos had made brief appearances in literally three other Marvel movies and we finally got a film focusing on him. Even at the ending credits, it says that Thanos will return and not the Avengers! The plot's pretty standard with the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians Of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from collecting all the Infinity Gems making him the most powerful being in the Universe. The biggest part of this movie is the ending in which...they actually fail.Yep, Thanos gets everything he wants and immediately gains his goal of wanting to kill half the people in the entire Universe! There possibly hasn't been a movie with more deaths of named characters. This was in fact something that happened in the comics, but it seemed so crazy I had no idea it would actually happen here! It's a shame that we don't get to see all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy in the same place at the same time. I believe this is the longest Marvel movie ever made. It certainly didn't seem like it as the pacing was so great!They said this movie would be darker, but it seemed to have a lot of jokes at first. Then came the ending and even the ending credits seemed gloomy. We finally get to see Loki kick the bucket. It's great that we have the characters reference all of their losses. It's just one awesome action scene after another. Unlike ""Transformers"" these ones are beautiful looking and creative. ****","10/10"

Not lining up to see the sequel/conclusion. I'd rather read the comics, or watch it on cartoons. Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe.Try to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing. And it was cool to see so many Avengers represented. Had some cool scenes.

"Thor","bgsmall","19 May 2018","Caveats on this review are; I'm no especial fan of comic book storylines made into films, my primary reason for attending was to take my children for their entertainment (not mine).As you might expect from a comic book rendering; the central plot of revolves around Thanos (the 'baddie') intent on decimating humanity by ~50% of it's current number to 'restore balance' to an over-crowded universe that has dwinding supplies and no means to support the ever growing populus. Taking that and the film at face value - this is a bizzare and macarbe storyline that hurtles between fight scenes without any character development or sub-plot development whatsoever (O.K, that's a little unfair - but not much). That's maybe my own fault - as I've not seen the other (precedent) movies in this series. However, as entertainment value goes, it's a little poor and in retrospect I would not have taken my children to see it.Now, taking the central plot as something 'other' than just fantasy I have a couple of questions / statements:
1. Is the storyline in anyway faithful to what was written in the comic book storylines?
2. Who signed off on the budget of this movie? - I'm guessing it cost $$$$$$$ (that's seven, each representing a 10-fold increase in magnitude) at least.
3. Whoever (individual or committee) did sign off on this budget, then also implicitly (or maybe explicitly) approved the premise of the central plot.
4. Given that Hollywood has been used historically to influence audiences and therefore by extrapolation (largely developed world) populations via it's 'messages' (propaganda) is this warning or threat? 
5. I don't believe that a movie of such an incredible budget is signed off without having an ulterior motive (usually paving the way for later films and more money) - and unless I've missed something - they just trashed the franchise??Just because I'm paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get me.","10/10"

I even went back to watch the original Iron Man and forgot that in those days, Disney didn't have their mitts on it yet. It was a Paramount movie. My how times have changed.For me, the movie was all over the place, jumping from earth, to a distant planet, etc. Yes, the war extends across the galaxy, that much is understood, but too many cross stories, and the entire former Avengers team isn't even together. It does set up the 2nd half that comes out in 2019 which looks lie there will be a head-on face-to-face again with two of the Avengers that split apart, especially since, well, you know why.All in all, the CGI graphics were excellent. Very top notch. But, a movie can only look so great before it falls under it's own weight, and I'm sorry, but AIW does just that. Editing is sub-par, there are some good one-liners, but I had just watched Ant Man and the Wasp just before this at home and that was a great movie for me. Funny, hilarious and action packed. This, so-so. Disney is trying way too hard here. Need to get back to reality and ground this series back to how it started.I dare say that AIW is the Marvel Universe's ""The Last Jedi"".

"Thor: Love and Thunder","masonsaul","7 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.","6/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","blott2319-1","20 July 2022","I think most people thought it was a big mistake when Disney cut ties with Lord & Miller before they completed their Solo film. Now I'm not so sure. It's a little off-putting having a downright farcical movie in an established cinematic universe. Thor: Love and Thunder is about as grounded as a Naked Gun movie, but for some reason the comedy rarely hits for me, where I can enjoy it in an actual spoof. I was surprised, despite the nearly constant attempts at humor, the crowded theater I was in rarely did more than chuckle. If they're going to make a straight-up comedy then they need it to be more laugh-out-loud funny. Of course comedic taste is extremely subjective, so I'm sure some people enjoy laughing along. I just wish it was as effective as Taika Waititi's other films have been for me (including Thor Ragnarok.)The real problem with Thor: Love and Thunder is that it is so irreverent but they also try to tackle heavier topics. The film starts with the death of a child, it focuses on a major character dealing with cancer, and the villain is literally called ""the god butcher."" Going back to my comparison to The Naked Gun, it's like you are watching that film and the filmmakers expect you to feel bad about Nordberg almost getting killed. There is no weight to anything, and it undercuts any attempt at emotion. I'd be genuinely shocked if someone told me they shed a tear while watching this movie, even if the humor lets up at the big climactic moment, though it clearly is trying for some real heart-tugging. I can take a light-hearted movie in the MCU where nothing of vital importance happens, but there are some important plot points, and that's a problem.That's not the only problem with Thor: Love and Thunder, and I could probably go on a full tirade about many of the other issues. However, I will restrain myself and just hit each one like quick bullet points. The handing off of Mjolnir like a loyal pet kind of undermines the magic of the whole ""worthy"" thing established prior to this film. The quick shuffling off of the Guardians of the Galaxy is about as shoddy as Chris Pratt's hair in the film. The whole god convention sequence is atrocious and makes you feel like Gorr has the right idea. Thor has become as shallow and dumb as the version they featured on the What If show. The handing off of Thor's lightning powers to anyone at any time with any weapon makes him look rather selfish in prior films when they could have used a bit of extra help against someone like Thanos. The deus ex machina of the Eternity wish now makes previous plans of people like Thanos and even the Scarlet Witch feel over-complicated when all they needed was a quick trip with Stormbreaker. I'll stop there, but the really sad thing about all this is that it has taken less than 3 years for the MCU to go from a franchise where I couldn't bear to miss a single film, to a franchise where I might just skip out on some movies because the quality has dipped so dramatically.","3/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","ryrymadrid","9 July 2022","I'm a huge marvel fanboy, and hardly ever have anything bad to say to about the MCU, but this was a huge letdown. Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","TakeUpReel","14 July 2022","...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) ""comedy.""During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The ""jokes"" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There's too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought...""I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie."" That's not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.","3/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","mluinstra","13 July 2022","There are so many things wrong with this film, I'm not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor's costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she's a girl. I guess Queen wasn't good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other ""Thors"" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor's clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.","3/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","afatedcircle","8 July 2022","First off let's start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif's arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There's so much of it that it isn't even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going ""can we get on with the movie?"". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The ""serious"" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, ""funny"" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that's one of many reasons it wasn't enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems ""final"".Thor steals Zeus' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn't it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn't they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor ""gives him a beer"" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr's resurrected daughter. It's just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok's mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.","3/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","FeastMode","8 July 2022","This review will come off as very negative, but I had a decent time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, Love and Thunder is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving two goats that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or the 20 times after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is a horrendous decision...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. I can only imagine what could have been if 40% of the movie was dedicated to that character. I can only imagine how amazing it would have been if they treated the God Butcher like The Dark Knight treated Joker.Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me.EDIT: I decided to give this another shot. Sometimes it's easier the second time without the hype and knowing what to expect. But I felt pretty much the same. I enjoyed a lot of it, but the stuff I disliked bothered me just as much.The two things that stood out to me the second time around, Bale's performance is amazing and they are idiots for underutilizing him. And the goats are the single worst thing in the entire MCU. Changing rating from 6 to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022, IMAX 7/20/2022)","5/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","FallenEye","14 July 2022","Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil.""Gorr - The God Butcher"", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn't have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi's egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don't interpret this as me ""bashing"" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it's their parents' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: ""Whatever it Takes"".Thor: Love and Thunder: ""Whatever"".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would've made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth's family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I'm not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I'm merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I'm just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I'd ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would've laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.","3/10"

But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie.

This just became a movie about a superhero who finally snapped and decided to act as a complete idiot from now on... What a great way to destroy years of character development.The writing is just lazy and the director made an excellent work of transforming it into a parody movie of itself.

Not the most awesome, but really enjoyable entertainment. I'd love to watch them again some time. But how am I supposed to do this again? When you see SIF in Thor 1, you will think of the worst death scene ever invented in the history of entertainment from Thor 4 and you won't get immersed into the movie. If I see Avengers again, I will think of this ""funny"" Thor and not of the great hero they created once.And even if you want to make ""Naked Gun"" in the marvel universe, how does Bales character fit in here?

It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too.

Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn't have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren't even funny, it's like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","frommeltstephanie","9 July 2022","While not the worst Marvel film, it is certainly not worthy of high praise. Ragnarok was a masterpiece but Taika falls incredibly short of expectations for a bar that was set high in the beginning phases of the MCU. I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't love it, and that is a trend with some of their recent offerings. I'm on the fence about a rating of 7, but my favorite MCU movies are in the 8-10 range.Characters:
Thor has been reduced to a joke and doesn't have the appeal he once had. Why does he look like a carnie ala Joe Dirt? Why is he so weak, dumb and needy?Valkayrie's character has been reduced to a lesser version of her former self and her rule of New Asgard was pitiful and lacked inspiration. Tessa's talent was totally wasted.Christian Bale's performance, while exceptional was a bit too Voldemort-esque.The appearance of the Guardians was lame -who would look up to Starlord? Chris Pratt came across as a white trash version of the character first introduced and has completely lost his likability. Rocket is the best character in the Guardians and he barely had any lines.The first battle was against hawklike chicken muppets riding Star Wars knockoff vehicles and they just weren't formidable in the least.The cameos were fun (Hella) and the goats were annoying when they didn't have to be.Music:
The use of music was ill-timed and not matched to the action -no offense to GNR, but why so much of their music? November Rain was the only song that seemed to be paired well with the action. There are so many 80's rock and metal songs that would have made a better fit .Plot:
Boring and drawn-out. Pay no attention to the commenters whining about ""wokeness"" and this has nothing to do with anything other than their own prejudice and intolerance. The humor was dumb, childish and just not that funny or witty, unless maybe you are a 8 year old boy raised by immature parents.I'm a huge Marvel fan but I have been so disappointed in recent offerings that are a result of Disney greed, poor writing and lazy directing.","7/10"

It makes me uncomfortable. The forced jokes and parody just don't sit well with me and I long for a more 'serious' take for a Thor movie. Other marvel films have embraced humour (Ant-Man is a great example) but not at the expense of the characters ... but Thor seems to have done a 180 in terms of personality at times - at times coming across as an idiot, which is really sad.I also didn't enjoy the borderline camp and racist Zeus ... which was a waste of Russell Crowe's talent and if that was all Taika's idea then shame on him. This was easily the least enjoyable portion of the movie for me.The Guardians also seemed a little like a wasted opportunity and for all the effort of getting them together for the movie I expected them to be in more than the first 10 minutes.I think this was better then Ragnarok - but neither were better than the first Thor ... or maybe even the second (gasp!).67/100.","7/10"

He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene.

So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this. This is on par with the worst of the genre and I cannot phantom who can honestly like this.","2/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","gavinp9","6 July 2022","'Thor: Love and Thunder' (or Thor 4) is a bridge between 'Avengers: Endgame' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3' and is not really linked to any of the other recent MCU films/TV shows, but it does a really good job of building on 'Thor: Ragnarok' and the spirit of that film, including making Valkyrie (Thompson) and Korg (Waititi) the two main sidekicks of Thor (Hemsworth, who both ground him and add humour.The plot is based around Gorr (Bale) having a sword that can kill gods, set-up well in the first 10min, and at the same time, Jane (Portman) being back as ""The Mighty Thor"" and being able to wield Mjolnir. A lot of this is explained in nice quirky montages, courtesy of Korg. There's plenty of great cameos - from a lot of Aussies too, since it was filmed here - but the biggest (not a spoiler) is Russell Crowe as Zeus, who has a semi-important role, and is great.Love & Thunder is very fast-paced, using the soundtrack excellently - especially four Guns N Roses songs - and it's amazing the difference of ""the vibe"" during/after 'Thor: The Dark World' and 9 years later compared to this film. The black and white scene is excellent, there's plenty of battles and whenever it starts to get too serious, there's some well-placed jokes. The ending seems fitting and leaves you happy to see where Thor's journey takes him.","8/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","duggies70","31 May 2023","I loved the start. The back story of Gorr was wonderful. I never liked or cared about the movie version of Jane Foster. This did nothing to change that. Making her the principal character left me with little hope this movie would please me.The constant bad jokes were just annoying. Not only were they not humorous, they were ill timed. The king/queen of Asgard doing TV commercials was pathetic. I'd heard plenty of bad reviews on this movie, but they didn't do it justice; it's much worse than I'd heard.I'm not certain how the Valkyrie that abandoned Asgard somehow ends up as ""The Woman King?""

"Thor: Love and Thunder","rghvvikas","7 July 2022","It's surely a disappointing one from Marvel, After a disastrous Ms Marvel show i expected something concrete from Marvel. The Movie is full of comic punches even at the more intense scenes. Christian Bale did a fantastic job at God Butcher but there is just not enough of him for my appetite. Gorr fails to represent himself a Threat at any level to Thor or any other god because we don't get to see the depth of character. The movie feels to be very rushed, it was like watching 4 mini episodes of a single series. The climax was just way more obvious. The Only saving grace I think was of Mighty Thor Arc which was executed beautifully otherwise it was all just a filler for phase five MCU.Watch it once for the sake of continuation if you are an MCU follower rest you can easily skip it. Honestly if it was not a part of a franchise, it's totally not worth going to theatre.","4/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","MiroslavKyuranov","6 July 2022","Taika has managed to balance humor, emotion and action in a way that must be experienced in order to be described. The story is more than interesting. Once again, Waititi points us in a certain direction, and just when you think you know what's going to happen, he turns our heads. If you liked ""Ragnarok"" you'll like this one too, if not...well probably this movie will not be your cup of tea.At this point, everyone knows that Hemsworth was born for the role of Thor, but in this movie, he elevates his character to a completely different level...you'll see.Natalie Portman returns as Jane, but unlike previous films in which she was not a particularly interesting character, Taika has applied her magic and, in addition to embodying her in Mighty Thor, makes her a well-built character. Her return to the franchise is important for Thor's graduation, but it also tells us a story you can't watch indifferently. She's also funny, something we can't say about her previous incarnations in the role.All other supporting characters such as Valkyrie, Korg and Guardians also add a pinch or more of themselves to the final product. The chemistry between Thor and the Guardians is ridiculous, something we already saw in ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"". The chemistry between Valkyrie and Mighty Thor is something I can watch all day. Korg has a bigger role than and every scene is pure pleasure - that's what happens when you make enough pamphlets for a revolution!Christian Bale...frankly it's still surreal that he's part of the MCU, but his role as Gorr The Godbutcher is quite the reason for an actor of his caliber to perform it. Gorr is brutal, some of his scenes will remain etched in my mind for a long time, but not his radical actions are the only thing that makes his character memorable. You know that once the villain of the movie makes you sympathize with him and understand him, he is more than ""another villain"".One of the best action scenes in the entire Marvel universe is in ""Love And Thunder""! I can't wait to watch the movie again! The film feels like a collection of several comic book editions of Thor, adapted in the form of a film, flooded with a solid dose of style and music from the 80's.""Thor: Love And Thunder"" is all that was expected and more. Taika doesn't do more of the same, but pushes the boundaries even more, giving you a solid dose of laughter, action and emotions that you may not be ready for! The film has many pleasant surprises for fans and the love for the details is visible. The film surpasses all expectations balancing absolutely bombastic insanity with moving character driven stories. Christian Bale is top tier and Natalie Portman is truly outstanding. Waititi may have just delivered the MCU's best movie of Phase 4 and certainly one of the top 10 in the entire Marvel universe.You know this, but still stay for the credit scenes, which are extremely important for future events at MCU!","2/10"

Its going to take fans saying enough and voting with their pocketbook along with shareholders saying we invested in you to do great storytelling not just churn content and merchandise.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","philthegreatone-786-63058","7 July 2022","Thor with help from Valkyrie played by the great Tessa Thompson and his ex Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. They have to take on Gorr the Butcher played by Christian Bale. This film is visually stunning with some really funny typical Waititi humor.I really love the themes of redemption and love going on in this film. Waititi loves making films about misfits and children at the heart of his stories. There is a cool 80's soundtrack that I really liked. I love Tessa Thompson's character in particular the first bisexual character in the marvel universe. She is funny, heroic and sexy with an awkward sense of humor. Thompson is one of my favorite actress's right now. She can do small indie films with depth and great action films like this one. Hemsworth is always great funny, powerful and shows depth on screen as well. Natalie Portman as Jane Foster was terrific her character now has stage four cancer. She uses Thor's hammer to make herself better and have adventures with her love Thor again. Bale as the villain shows a real dark side but also depth to his character as well. As we seen before in Marvel films they humanize the villains. I really enjoyed this film and think it is one of the best films of 2022.","2/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","MrDHWong","7 July 2022","""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is the 29th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the fourth solo film to focus around the Marvel superhero Thor. Directed and co-written by Taika Waititi (""Thor: Ragnarok"", ""Jojo Rabbit"") and again starring Chris Hemsworth in the lead role, it continues the God of Thunder's journey throughout the universe in a solid adventure that both satisfies and saddens.After the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been in outer space with the Guardians of the Galaxy, visiting distant planets to help out their inhabitants with any problems they are facing. Some time later, Thor is forced to part way with the Guardians after he receives an emergency signal from New Asgard back on Earth. Upon arriving home, Thor is informed that a being known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) has come into possession of the god-murdering Necrosword and intends to wipe out all gods from existence, with the citizens of New Asgard next on his hit list. With this new danger looming, Thor hurriedly recruits his associates Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi), and his old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), the latter of whom has taken up the mantle of ""Mighty Thor"", to stop Gorr from his deicidal killing spree.Since he was first introduced into the MCU back in 2011, Thor's solo films have been, to put it mildly, a mixed bag. The first two struggled to find a harmonious tone, with an inconsistent blend of out-of-place comedy and unnecessarily dark moments preventing them from becoming memorable additions to the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, if it weren't for the amusing antics of Loki (Tom Hiddleston), I assume most people would skip these two films without a second thought. All of this was rectified in 2017 with ""Thor: Ragnarok"" finally striking the right balance between humorous and serious themes, all of which can be traced back to the involvement of Taika Waititi. All of that remains here in ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", as it thankfully continues everything that made its predecessor such a great inclusion to the MCU.Though it doesn't deviate too much from the previous film in terms of tone, this one still retains the same amount of fun and energy that all the MCU fans crave. Here, we get to see Thor as a more upbeat character, who has worked through many of his personal insecurities that were holding him back following his fight with Thanos years ago. He is more optimistic and sure of himself, and despite causing the occasional collateral damage like most superheroes, he always finds ways to make up for it (or at the very least TRIES to).I like how over the course of three prior solo outings and four ""Avengers"" films, Thor has since developed some of the most relatable humanistic traits in the whole MCU, which is interesting considering the character is supposed to be a perfect god. We've seen him go through a wide range of personality changes, from self-important deity, humbled defender of Earth, depressed wreck haunted by his mistakes, and now a man contemplating what his future might bring. But it is in the latter example we see Thor delve deep into what is arguably the most important emotion of all: Love.Considering the film has the word ""Love"" in its title, it stands to reason that it will be the overarching theme its main character will grapple with. Long time MCU fans will remember Thor's original love interest Jane Foster, the astrophysicist from the first two movies whose belief in a scientific explanation for everything is shattered when she meets the God of Thunder for the first time. Though the two seemed to hit it off at first, certain factors prevented the pair from going any further, leading to their break-up and, in turn, her not appearing in the third film.Foster returns here with a vengeance as she makes up for her absence with her new identity as ""Mighty Thor"". Watching as Thor tries to comprehend the sight of his ex-girlfriend donning not only similar attire to him but also using a repaired version of his old hammer Mjolnir provided some amusing comic relief upon their reunion and the way he handles this situation shows how far he has come as a character. He now truly feels a love for someone unlike anything he has felt previously, allowing the story to take their relationship to levels not seen before.In addition to implementing all of these new romantic elements, director Taika Waititi also uses his eye for visual detail to the film's advantage. He shows us brightly coloured locations such as the Omnipotent City, a sprawling metropolis populated by various other gods, including Zeus himself (played by Russell Crowe). Waititi uses this place in particular to show how these gods all have different attitudes to what their titles may suggest. For instance, some of these gods actually care about the well-being of the less fortunate while others just find their positions nothing more than a burden. These moments allow for some quirky universe-building that only a film set in the MCU could properly pull off.But it's not all vibrant environments we get to see. There's also the Shadow Realm, a sinister place lit only by the colours of black and white. When our heroes arrive at this menacing location, the film starts to resemble those classic colourless feature films, tapping into that old school feeling of people exploring somewhere frightening. The movie's antagonist Gorr appropriately considers this place home and his dark intentions suit it to a tee. The way in which Waititi is able to balance these two polar opposite locations alongside one another is testament to his talent as a filmmaker and goes to show that his presence among the MCU staff is a welcome one.Returning to the role after a three-year absence, Chris Hemsworth demonstrates how much he has evolved alongside Thor as a character, going from a stoic overpowered god to a fun-loving hero not afraid to show his sensitive side. Hemsworth uses his signature Aussie larrikin likeability to bring out the amusement factor that makes what I call the ""Waititi-era"" Thor a more endearing hero than when he was first introduced. His scenes with Natalie Portman as Jane Foster had a believable warmth to them, which is surprising since I always thought they lacked chemistry with one another in the first two films. I guess it was simply poor writing in those movies because with the way the pair interact here you'd swear their relationship always had this much of a spark to it. With that in mind, Portman is clearly enjoying herself more this time, considering she has a more physical role in the story than before. It's nice to see her occasionally one-up her co-star during the film's action scenes as she manages to hold her own when the going gets tough.I also think Christian Bale did a good job as the film's main villain Gorr, a man hell-bent on causing the extinction of all gods. Knowing how talented an actor Bale is, it was nice to see him provide the character with more dimension than your typical MCU antagonist. Without venturing into spoiler territory, Gorr's backstory is shown to be quite tragic, immediately clueing the audience into why he is on this genocidal crusade in the first place. The best types of villains are the ones who think they are doing everything for the greater good (like a certain purple Titan wielding a gauntlet), and I did feel sorry for Gorr once I understood his motivations, although this of course doesn't justify him wanting to murder the innocent.Now four solo movies in, it's great to see how a hero like Thor has finally found the appropriate balance between a powerful god and a regular person. Though I think there is little else that can be done in future films to develop the character beyond what we have right now, we can still appreciate him for what he is already - a genuine person with relatable flaws. And that is what I believe to be one of the reasons why the MCU has been successful for so long - it shows that heroes, even literal gods, are capable of going through legitimate growth and changes to become better people. That and the casual humour of course. Either way, it has proven to be a winning combination.I rate it 8/10.","7/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","theffachrif","6 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is about The Space Viking Thor Odinson, after teaming up with Guardians of the Galaxy to help everyone in the galaxy who are in distress. And later he travels to New Asgard to fight a new threat in Gorr The God Butcher who've vowed that all gods will die, only to discover his ex, Jane Foster, who now wields Mjolnir and became the Mighty Thor.I liked this movie as much as I did with Thor Ragnarok. The visuals and cinematography are slightly more colorful and stunning than before. The humor is slightly funnier and sillier as well. And the actions are fun as hell.And again, the pacing and runtime are the issues for me with this movie. Because some moments are happened relatively quick, like when Gorr becomes The God Butcher and Jane becomes The Mighty Thor. A little backstory or a flashback about the necrosword would be neat. Although it didn't really affect the overall story so it didn't bother me that much, I just wanted some more after what they did in Multiverse of Madness.MAN, Christian Bale really lived long enough to see himself become the villain. His performance as Gorr possibly is the best villain portrayal in the MCU to date. And seeing Natalie Portman back together with Chris Hemsworth since The Dark World is a pleasure. I'm satisfied with the ending it definitely lives up to the title ""Love and Thunder"".(SPOILER TIME) (SPOILER TIME) (SPOILER TIME)In the post-credit scene, I was hoping Loki would show up considering he actually died in the main timeline.

I'm not saying that Taika Waititi is a bad director, but the fact is he wrote and directed this empty movie with some jokes. He could maybe make a great Deadpool movie but Thor should have been more than this. Even Christian Bale's outstanding performance as Gorr couldn't save it.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","Zeus-pro","7 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is largely successful in honoring Thor's long journey towards self-actualization and rarely falters while keying into the crackling chemistry between leads Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Tessa Thompson. It's essentially the MCU's first romantic comedy, and plays with those tropes in delightful ways. But while Thor and Jane's relationship is handled well, Love and Thunder is less deft -- and a lot safer than you'd expect -- in pushing the greater MCU story forward. Christian Bale's Gorr feels underutilized and Tessa Thompson's King Valkyrie takes a frustrating back seat, especially as the movie goes on. Taika Waititi's signature humor and visual style persist from Ragnarok, and are essential to buoying the movie through its cookie-cutter plot. With Hemsworth as enthusiastic an Asgardian as ever, Thor's future with both love and thunder are bright.","6/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","fredschaefer-406-623204","17 July 2022","I am a lifelong reader of Marvel comics, and have consistently tried to see every single MCU film in the theater going back to the first Captain America film. I was blown away by INFINITY WAR and ENDGAME, and unlike some fans that have soured on Marvel's super hero adventures after the latter, I've hung in there, finding a lot to like even in film efforts that paled when compared to what came before. Though Robert Downey Jr. And Chris Evans have retired their parts as Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, there was still the consolation that Chris Hemsworth would continue as Thor, the Asgardian God of Thunder. Hemsworth is a perfect fit in the role, with a real movie star's physical presence, and a good sense for comedy, two attributes that are not always evident in others. For these reasons, I was really looking forward to THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER, the first stand alone Thor adventure since the excellent THOR: RAGNAROK back in 2017.Sadly, I was disappointed. Though I didn't find LOVE AND THUNDER to be the disaster some fans did, I thought the film was done in by a script and a director that took the God of Thunder down the wrong path in a big way. I have admired a lot of Taika Waititi's work in the past, especially on RAGNAROK and JOJO RABBIT, but this time he leaned into the humor way too much, doubling down, and then tripling down, on the humorous elements that worked so well in RAGNAROK, but forgetting that there needs to be some heart and sincere emotion for the humor to play off. That's something that even a lesser MCU film like last summer's BLACK WIDOW pulled off well. LOVE AND THUNDER picks up post ENDGAME where Thor is roaming the galaxy with the GUARDIANS, enjoying the adventures of being Space Viking. But soon, he is back on earth trying to hunt down a villain going by the name of Gorr the God Butcher, who, for reasons of his own, is going about systematically killing off all the mythical Gods of the many civilizations spread throughout the universe. This is where Thor, and his trusty sidekick Korg (CGI, but voiced by Waititi) meet up with his old flame, Jane Foster, who is now wielding the hammer, Mjolnir, and going by the name of Lady Thor. After an awkward reunion, Thor, Jane, Korg, and Valkyrie (again played by Tessa Thompson) are off in search of help to fight Gorr, who has kidnapped the children of New Asgard. What drags this plot down is the incessant humor, with most of the jokes centered on Thor being a clueless oaf, and his relationship with his ex, who is now his equal when it comes to super heroics. And for the first two thirds of the film, that is just about all it is: setup and punch line...setup and punch line...repeat and repeat. And in case we didn't get the joke, Korg says something to underline it. The God of Thunder himself is reduced to being a big muscle bound doofus in scene after scene, a far cry from the prideful and earnest character trying to do what is right and be worthy that we knew in The Avengers films and his own earlier solo screen appearances. I agree with those who say that much of the film felt like badly written SNL skit-especially Zeus's lightning bolt, which looked as if it had been found in NBC's prop room. Having Matt Damon, Sam Neill, and Luke Hemsworth (joined by newcomer Melissa McCarthy) reprise their cameos from RAGNOROK only diminished the joke, and the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY were totally superfluous the story. There should be a new rule that cameos have to be pertinent to the plot in some way. I have no idea what they were going for in Russell Crowe's small part as Zeus, a part played in a way that seemed to belong in another movie. And the deficits in the script only highlighted how badly this film relied on CGI effects.Only in the final third, when there is a showdown with Gorr, does the story switch gears, and it feels like we're in a real super hero film. And that is because Christian Bale, who plays Gorr, really does show up and give a heartfelt performance. Gorr's origin in the pre-credits opening is well done, and anytime Bale was onscreen, everything is kicks up a notch. But even he was hurt by an inconsistent script that had Gorr, traumatized by the loss of his daughter, turn around and terrorize the children of New Asgard.But despite my criticism, I won't say I hate LOVE AND THUNDER and consider the MCU dead the way many online have done. If you don't ask much of it, the film is entertaining, and I did like seeing the Marvel concept of Eternity brought to the screen. But mostly, I'm left with a sense of an opportunity missed. We didn't get a rousing adventure with a self described Space Viking, which would have been nice. But most of all, we don't get an idea of where the MCU is heading in this next phase. There were two post credits scene, one of which implied that a dead character might have a way back into the MCU, and in the other, we briefly glimpse a super powered being not shown before. I was hoping for something dealing with the next GUARDIANS film, or maybe a hint at who the Big Bad will be in this next phase. Then there is the introduction of the X-Men and the Fantastic Four to the MCU proper after MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS. It would have been nice to see some progress on that front. I know Covid has scrambled the time table for the MCU after ENDGAME, but right now, it feels as if they are simply treading water. And more films like LOVE AND THUNDER will burn up a lot of goodwill with fans like me.","2/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","CoopaSoopa","6 July 2022","After seeing doctor strange in the multiverse of madness; which I did enjoy; I came into this movie with rather mediocre expectations, overall I think the film was good but not great.The representation was incredible, and the cinematography was awesome, but the plot and character depth was rather stale, Gorr the main villain came off as both menacing but weak, and his whole characters story was rather shallow, as for Jane Foster however, her character was probably the best in the film. Thor was Thor as usual, and his overall character change by the end of the movie was not to extensive, but good.The side characters of the film, who still served good purpose for the plot were great, Valkyrie and Korg shined in there performances and were probably the funniest characters of the film. The Guardians of the Galaxy were great aswell, but didn't shine as much as they did in there previous film appearances, hopefully that's to change in the Holiday Special, and Guardians Vol. 3.To avoid spoilers I'll leave it at this, it's worth a watch, but it's not for everyone, I personally rate it between 6 - 7 out of 10, but one thing I'm left with is the fear that these films are soon to become cash grabs, and not genuine works of art, I see phase 4 as phase 1 (2.0), the stories created in these movies are gonna lead into a more extensive and greater plot, which I am excited, but worried about.I'm underwhelmed to say the least, but I'm happy that the film leaves the story open, and continued certain characters stories!

Interesting choice of soundtrack which will either be loved or hated by many I would say. It needed a good half hour more to flesh out the story. It was really quite short for a Marvel film.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","Vishal_s_kumar","6 July 2022","Thor: Ragnarok was a terrific movie, and Waititi has returned (with a co-writing credit) to deliver the next chapter in the ""Thor"" saga, restoring the atmosphere of the previous odyssey with a slightly heavier round of freewheeling fun, looking to keep the God of Thunder loose and amusing, but also hitting the big guy with some profound emotional weight this time out.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has cleaned himself up, feeling renewed purpose to help others with his weapon, Stormbreaker, and his Asgardian powers, happy to be part of the Guardians of the Galaxy with his pal, Korg (Taika Waititi). When the Guardians depart, looking to ditch Thor, the God of Thunder is left with a new threat in Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), a man who once believed in a higher power, only to learn of godly cruelties, inspiring a plan of revenge while armed with the devastating Necrosword. Gor is looking to slaughter all gods while trying to reach Eternity, kidnapping the children of New Asgard to tempt Thor into the open. However, the hero isn't easily defeated, joined by Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a gift of magical goats, and The Mighty Thor, with ex-girlfriend Jane (Natalie Portman) trying to prevent the spread of illness by claiming Mjonir's power, transforming her into a formidable warrior.Waititi does particularly well with villains, continuing his interest in dark paths with Gor, whose story is economically detailed in the prologue for ""Love and Thunder."" He was a simple man who trusted in his god, but Gor was betrayed by his faith, turned into a fool and soon a killer, taking the Necrosword on a journey to remove all gods from the universe. One doesn't hire Bale to play it cool, and the actor goes all out as Gor, with the skeletal figure of doom an unusual antagonist, living to torment others while setting out on a defined journey to Eternity, backed by creatures of the Shadow Realm. He's taken children, including Heimdall's son, to inspire a rescue mission, and Thor is ready for action. At least for the most part.""Love and Thunder"" finds Thor trying to find his place in the world again after time spent with the Guardians of the Galaxy, eager to return to power as the hero everyone looks up to, but writing disrupts such confidence with the reappearance of Jane, who's keeping herself alive with Mjolnir, which has reformed in the human's presence. Thor is floored by this reunion, unsure how to process seeing Jane as The Mighty Thor, wearing his outfit, and one of the best running gags in the feature is his secret interest in reconnecting with his beloved hammer, leading to some jealousy issues with Stormbreaker. ""Love and Thunder"" crisply arranges a plot and establishes emotional stakes, and it keeps the story on the move, sending Thor, Jane, Valkyrie, and Korg out into the world to acquire the help they need. This involves a visit to Zeus (a very silly Russell Crowe), with his powerful lightning bolt just the thing the gang needs to take on Gor.Waititi is making a comedy with ""Love and Thunder,"" working to revive the ""Ragnarok"" mood with defined playfulness from the cast, including Hemsworth, who seems to love playing Thor as an insecure Asgardian putting on a show of hypermasculinity to keep up appearances. Laughs are sizable in the endeavor, but there's a grim side to the screenplay that's a little harder for the helmer to manage. Jane's illness is addressed, and Gor's intro includes the death of his daughter, giving him the inspiration to rage. This heaviness doesn't always balance with goofiness, leading to a few awkward breaks in the action, but Waititi is trying to land a more sensitive ""Thor,"" and it works for the most part, exploring the tension between Thor and Jane as they work with their special powers and confront their personal history.Led Zeppelin is traded for Guns N' Roses in ""Love and Thunder,"" with Waititi keeping the metal cranked up and his visuals stunning, following the gang as they visit new lands, including the Shadow Realm, which turns everything black and white. The sequel successfully continues what ""Ragnarok"" started, developing personalities and action potential, keeping thrills coming and humor consistent. The new, fun Thor probably drives comic book enthusiasts crazy, but he does marvelously on the big screen, with Waititi understanding the bigness of the character, the colorfulness of his world, and the universal feeling of his uncertainty.","3/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","drakande","14 July 2022","Terrible Terrible movie. The plot holes and lack of consistency with the characters and timeline is shocking. It looks like all Taika is good for (apart from repeatedly flashing his name every other line in the end credits) is satire. And yes, it's funny in part, but we're not laughing with you Marvel studios; We're laughing at you as the credibility of all your offerings is disembowelled one character at a time by self grandiosed charlatans like Taika Wahiti. Such a shame. Generations of comic book heroes destroyed by an unthinking egopath.","8/10"

Well talking about the movie if you know the movie director than you should probably get the idea of his movie making. As I being completely honest I was expecting more but still I like it what the director has deliver us. Chris Hemsworth is far More better than in the endgame. Natalie & Tessa simply nailed it with rest of the cast. Story could've been more better because you have such a powerful villain but I don't know what the director thought and movies runtime could be long rather than it's Christian Bale just nailed it. Yeah he has less screentime but whenever he comes at screen he'll just made your day. Director should've given a lot more time to Gorr but still nonetheless. Anyway It's a fun movie if you are a THOR fan you'll definitely like it but don't expect too much because it's a standalone film as it should be....","7/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","vermaarya-99725","6 July 2022","This movie is so much fun which I was expecting just watching the trailer. This is probably the best Thor movie to date but I have a few problems with it. One, The dialogue with Jane and her problems doesn't really hit for me and another thing is that this movie is a bit too similar to Ragnarok in the sense of cool epic shots like the one with Thor awakening in Ragnarok. All those scenes are great to look at but lose their charm after a while. Otherwise, Chris Hemsworth, Christian bale and Taika watiti are at their absolute best in this movie. Visually this is one of the best MCU movies to date. If you have strayed away from the MCU like me, give this a shot, it's worth it.","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","cardsrock","19 August 2022","Thor's fourth feature film increasingly blurs the line between fun and farce, although it mostly succeeds in what it sets out to do. Taika gets a little too much free reign as there are many unnecessary jokes. I really hope you like screaming goats. In addition, it's often hard to take the dramatic moments seriously when you think there's about to be a joke inserted to undercut it.Natalie is a nice addition as she brings some gravitas, however her character is saddled with some occasional poor dialogue. Hemsworth is game as always with his stellar comedic chops. His interactions with his various weapons are some of the best scenes in the film. The colors and vibrancy Waititi brings continues to be a highlight and one particular scene on a moon is stunning to watch. I have to say I also loved the GNR needle drops.It's not too often that I wish a film was longer, but this is one of those cases. I feel like we miss a lot of Thor-Jane moments we need to really feel the payoff here. Gorr is also shockingly underutilized and we barely see him butcher any gods. Bale goes all out with a phenomenal performance as one of the MCU's best villains, but I just wanted more.Love and Thunder is pretty standard Marvel fare that we're all accustomed to, which is fine, however I wouldn't mind a more consequential story in Thor's next cosmic outing.","7/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","dave_maguire","7 July 2022","I love Thor - maybe an unpopular opinion but the first Thor film is one of favourites in the whole MCU. The fish out of water comedy elements were great and Chris Hemsworth shone with these comic moments. Thor got funnier as the movies went on but still retained a serious edge to the character. Then Taika Waititi got hold of the franchise to tell a story of loss and pain with ragnarok, and turned him in to an all out comedy foil - And this is much the same as that movie. Don't get me wrong, I did laugh at some bits, but then immediately thought this is ridiculous. I know people clearly like him but in my opinion Waititi has no place being involved these films, if Gorr hasn't butchered your god, then pray to them that he is never allowed near the franchise again!Thor is an absolute idiot in this film, you can never tell if, in his serious moments he is actually being serious, or acting that way within the character. He also somehow gets in to a love triangle with mjolnir and stormbreaker???? With the exception of Portman the film is full of annoying characters to be honest -Valkyrie - never looks bothered about what she's doing in the film and doesn't even take part in the last battle cos ""she might get killed"", despite talking to Jane earlier in the film about how she wants her Viking death so she can get to Valhalla????? Speaking of Valhalla, Sif makes an appearance so she can instantly be dumbed down and not understand how you get in to he place - even I know how to get in to it!!Korg - time has come and gone for him and he is just annoying now, constant interrupts the serious moments and just has no point in being in the film.Overall it's just a very boring story, there's no real plot, Thor finds out someone is murdering gods, and just goes to kill him.... Synopsis done, that's it! Way too much filler in the film and pointless scenes just to drag it out far longer than it needed to be. I had also heard that Gorr is the best MCU villain since Thanos.... not the Gorr I saw - he's barely even in the film! I did find his shadow powers visually impressive, but overall though he was quite underwhelming, and didn't really understand the ending - which was also underwhelming.Don't get me wrong, thee are some good elements to the film, there are some excellent set pieces, the cinematography is great at times, Natalie Portman is the best part of the film and I found she has a very compelling story during the film, and there are some genuinely tender moments between her and Chris Hemsworth when the film allows. And the goats are funny.... You'll see.The most worrying thing is, after seeing what phase four has given us so far, I really worry where the MCU is headed as there doesn't seem to be any overarching story arch going on with these films, there was one scene in Shang chi about the rings, but the rest of the credit scenes just seem to be confined to their own movies. I honestly don't know where they are going, and with the last four films being very ""cosmic"" based, I'm not sure what is going to happen with Black panther next.Anyway, rant over so in closing I'll say, if you like ragnarok then you'll love this film, if not then maybe best to wait till it's free.","6/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","chaudharysaab13","7 July 2022","A good movie, but too many jokes left me a bit distasteful. I couldn't comprehend the need of too much comic tone of the movie.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","cthirlby","7 July 2022","Had high hopes for this film. The fact Jane was in it I thought would bring in the emotion and also the sadness of the story with it and darkness of her having cancer. And also Gorr the God Butcher! Wow I was so excited for him to be in it and Christian Bale playing him was also exciting for me! This movie was fun, it was really fun! Fun isn't always enough. The movie was way too fast paced and didn't flesh out enough of the story. Jane having cancer was mentioned but added up to not too much especially considering the post credit scene, it was a little sad but wasn't really held on in a moment. Thor was alright in it I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, he's goofy and somewhat cool. Christian Bale though... Gorr the ""God Butcher"" himself! He did in fact live up to the name in the opening scene, but then where was the rest of it? Was it cut? The name and the look alone was scary but the actions weren't, no consequences or fear of losing any characters along the way. Gorr was watered down and your just supposed to imagine him killing gods I suppose. And he really wasn't in the movie that much either, they seriously under-utilised Christian Bale and did Gorr dirty. Can't say I was bothered by either of the post credit scenes. It was just fun there's nothing really more to it. Just way too fast paced, even more so than doctor strange which managed to pull it off so either it's the writing or things were cut and the movie should've been longer. Enjoyed it but disappointed so yeah but the style and the colours on screen were really pleasing to look at especially the black and white mixed with colour.","7/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","movieman6-413-929510","7 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder is the fourth Thor film in the film series. Like the third Thor film, this film is directed and this time also partly written by Taika Waititi.In the film, after all his adventures, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is somewhat lost in his life and decides to go back to New Asgard. Before returning here, he learns that a dark creature called Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) is on a mission to kill all the gods.When he arrives in New Asgard he wants to ask Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) for help, but here he sees that his old hammer Mjolnir has been restored, but has found another owner. This owner is his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who has magically taken over his hammer and powers. Along with Valkyrie and Korg (voice of Taika Waititi), both try to stop Thors Gorr before he manages to kill more gods.With this film, Tor is the first superhero from the Marvel film series to have four films of his own. Taika Waititi managed to get the Thor series moving again with the third Thor movie and is trying to do the same again with this fourth movie. Together with other script and story writers from other Marvel projects, he managed to turn the third Thor film into a more appropriate comedy action Sci-Fi film. In this fourth Thor film, the writing comes only from Taika Waititi herself and the more aspiring writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. The fact that the writing now comes from fewer people is reflected in the film. This fourth Thor film contains too many comedy elements, which often unnecessarily overshadow the drama moments and other elements. The comedy also comes at the cost of some of the different storylines, making some of these seem a bit rushed and if not clear which can sometimes lead to a more long-winded feel.Fortunately, Taika Waititi knows how to provide beautiful and believable visual effects in the film and thus brings out different worlds of the gods in creative ways. For example, he brings out the divine sides of the Marvel film universe more clearly and more playfully than they tried to do in the Marvel film Eternals, for example. In this film he also manages to use rock music from the 80s as a soundtrack in a fun and appropriate way.The returning cast members once again reprise their roles in this film. Despite the lesser sides of the script, Taika Waititi managed to persuade Natalie Portman to return to the Thor film series. Portman gets more drama sides with this film, but also super power sides to work with. In addition to Natalie Portman, Taika Waititi also managed to get Christian Bale back to act in a superhero movie with the script and request of his children. After his time as Batman in The Dark Knight trilogy, he no longer wanted to act in superhero movies. Bale brings a darker serious side to this film, adding more darkness and some light tension.","7/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","Joeltahapary","6 July 2022","Thor Love and Thunder is a good movie with an absolute good storyline.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","r96sk","24 August 2022","As usual for the MCU, 'Thor: Love and Thunder' is a good watch. I did want more from it, though.Chris Hemsworth remains the star of the show, I'm adding nothing new by saying he is just perfect for the role. Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi and Natalie Portman all make for good support. Christian Bale is also someone I enjoyed, I like the look of his character but kinda felt that I wanted to see more of him - it's like we see a beginning and an end, but part of me feels like we coulda had something in-between.The special effects are solid, as is the music; even if the track choices aren't the most creative. I probably would've shortened the run time a little, though that isn't anything all that noteworthy to be honest. There are some funny moments in there, which is always something I expect from a Taika Waititi flick.As for me and my own personal Thor ranking, this - like the 2011 original (also 7/10) - isn't one of my favourites (fwiw, I enjoy 'Thor: The Dark World' and 'Thor: Ragnarok' (both 9/10) way more) but it's still a fun enough time that I'd recommend it.I simply cannot (cannot, I tell you!) believe they didn't just call this 'Thor Four' btw... üíî","7/10"

Korg is the narrator and is telling us, the audience, the story of how they defeated Gor the God Butcher.The entire opening plays out with Korg' narration over the top and plays like someone telling you a story rather than action taking place in real time.I don't think it's a wild theory but if I'm wrong this is a very different movie.","7/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","IanHaymton","6 July 2022","The story it self in this movie is good, it's nothing we haven't seen before, but it's still good. But it's like they couldn't decide which direction to go with the story, so they went everywhere with it. Literally EVERYWHERE.On one hand we have a sad but also beautiful new happening/story surrounding Jane, which really got to me, and I wished they'd kept that realness and sense of honest reality throughout the movie. They didn't..The action scenes are cool and some intense, and the overall cinematic scenery is stunning, like we're use to receive from Marvel. And some scenes are really funny. But here's the problem, cause on the other hand they're trying too got damn hard to be exactly that: funny.It's like they've said: ""what can we joke about next?"" instead of focusing on the story. Instead of taking the heartfelt story they have, and made that the roots of this movie, they joke everything away. Jokes are meant to just spice things up a bit, put a little zing on it, not take over the whole show. This makes the story weak, and most of the story they're trying to deliver in this movie is lost. So why a score of 7?Cause the story between the jokes and orgie-humor, is that good.","8/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","SHU_Movies","7 July 2022","Thor: Ragnarok is a truly great movie that perfectly balances action, comedy and emotion through an interesting story. This movie was a fun mess. The main focus was on the comedy and action throughout a decent story that went downhill in the final act. It's decent, and Christian Pale (sorry, terrible joke) gives a great performance as Gorr The God Butcher - an interesting antagonist with a great motive. Like I say, the movie had a pretty great start with a solid first two acts. It just goes way downhill after that with a bad ending. Giving it a 7/10 is me being generous.","10/10"

I think it has more comedy than Ragnarok, so if you didn't like Ragnarok, you probably really won't like this. But it got some huge laughs (see it with a packed crowd) and I did laugh out loud a few times. There is also some great use of Guns n Roses songs.Of the cast Hemsworth is great, I love this version of Thor, as opposed to one from the first two movies. Bale was superb, he was very creepy when he was onscreen!! Natalie Portman works in a way I didn't expect. I LOVE Natalie Portman, but I never cared about the Thor and Jane relatiinship. I was surprised at how much I got into it and their relationship in this one. Russell Crowe is clearly having fun, but he won't be for everyone. Tessa Thompson is no fun, but that's how her character is written, so it's not her fault. Where was the bad ass from Ragnarok?It's tone is a bit all over, the comedy is so front and centre it kind of takes away from the seriousness of what is happening and it is serious at times.The Jane/Mighty Thor storyline seemed a bit rushed and I'd have liked more Bale, but overall, I really liked it a lot and will be seeing it again.","7/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","AfricanBro","8 July 2022","After endgame, I noticed marvel trailers only use cuts from the opening 15min, so everything after is more of a mystery and I like that. On that note though, I did watch a YouTube video on '10 things to remember before watching Thor' and basically everything it suggested would happen actually did happen, it was still interesting but I would suggest avoiding that one if you're one to look at recaps too.This is definitely the most schmaltzy take on Thor so far, it still kept its comedic and action elements. I love how it wasn't just a hero stuff but more on Thor's search for love and life's meaning. I love how they focused more on the actual action, not just the visuals which is what I felt some of the recent MCU movies did. It was also paced really well, didn't feel too long or too short. Gorr is definitely one of the best MCU villains, I still think Thanos was it, also love how Ultron looked at the internet once and it was enough to convince him humanity needs to go, just funny to me. So Gorr's definitely up there, with a more cognizant villain origin story. And his nickname 'The God Butcher' is so badass, I love it.One thing I didn't like about the movie is that there were slight inconsistencies in strength/power levels, Gorr would clearly have the upper hand and in an instant one of the Thors or Valkyrie have him fleeting, like you were whooping their ass 2s ago, wasn't too concerning though. The girl playing Gorr's daughter had terrible acting though, but she's just a kid so if she is coming back hope she does better. The scene sequence at the gods gathering felt too comedic for me, definitely justifying Gorr's hatred for them, but I thought they could have taken matters a little more seriously. Biggest problem with the movie was it was they tried sneaking in jokes at everywhere unprovoked.Still got a standing ovation at the end which shocked me, it was okay but not that good. For every good moment there is also a cringe one and I think that smudges the movie as a whole. Like the goats were so over done. Had low expectations but turned out better than M. O. M. In my opinion. I thought Zeus was ""killed"" way too easy, barely showed why he was the strongest and wisest god, just circus theatrics. I won't say much on the post credit scenes(2) but they got me really excited for whatever's coming next. I gave it a 7 but it's just about, the good things make me want to give it an 8 but the bad ones make me want to drop it to a 6. There's a good movie somewhere in there, still good enough to recommend watching though.","3/10"

The Hulk and Grandmaster added to the success of that movie so in my opinion this one didn't live up to it's former one. Christian Bale was great but not exceptional.

But, because this is a Marvel movie and he's playing a ""disposable"" villain you already know how this ends without me needing to tell you. For shame. Why does Marvel have the tendency to kill of the three-dimensional villains that are actually interesting? They should keep pumping out complex and flawed villains, same as heroes. Otherwise, what's the point? For us to be bored to death? Mission accomplished. Marvel: Please do better.","6/10"

Don't get me wrong, the movie has a lot of very good jokes I genuinely laughed out loud, but the movie was so focused on delivering jokes non-stop that it became a parody of itself.This movie is the definition of sometimes less is more.Almost every moment that had some sort of heart to it is completely buried under a pile of jokes that made these moment completely irrelevant.Taika found a great balance of story and humor with Ragnarok. I mean, almost everyone praised how the humor he injected into the Thor, brought it to a whole new level. Easily on of the best movies of the Infinity Saga movies.So I'm a bit confused as to why they decided to go so overboard with the jokes, that it killed almost every character moment.Christian Bale's Gorr was highly anticipated, as we all know the acting chops he can bring to any project. And he did bring everything one would expect from any character he plays.Thing is ... he's the only one who tried to bring any amount of seriousness to the movie, and was severely underutilized. He was creepy and intimidating. His character had the right motivation for what he was doing. He had everything a good villain needs. I'm not exaggerating when I say that in the almost 2 hour runtime of the movie he was present about 25-30 minutes in total, most of which was in the climax of the movie.So if the main villain of the movie takes a back seat what was this all about? Well, in short it was romantic comedy between Thor and Jane. Emphasis on the comedy part, since the romance was severely overshadowed by constant need to inject comedy into every single scene.There was even a genuine moment for 2 gay characters, that was very well written, and would have worked so well as character development moments, if it wasn't squeezed in-between a major story beat and a returning joke, that overstayed it's welcome, since it was done for around the 6th time at this point.So my biggest gripe with the movie as whole is that it can't be taken serious at any level, as the movie handles itself as parody within the confines and logic of its own universe.","2/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","sayedabidali","7 July 2022","I pretty much loved this film. Because of its humour, CGI, VFX, Soundtrack and Impactful Emotional moments. I enjoyed watching it. It was really like a treat to me. I personally suggest you (who have not watched this film yet go watch it on big screen) from your busy schedule. Because it will entertain you in a best possible way. I loved two characters in this movie the Most and i.e Natalie Portman's Mighty Thor and Christian Bale's Gorr the God Butcher because they have a quite interesting, engaging storyline in this movie. So no complaints about this film unlike Doctor Strange 2.","9/10"

Thor: Love and Thunder is the first Thor movie in what is essentially the new 'phase 1' of Marvel. There is a lot that needs to be set up and unfortunately Thor: Love and Thunder has to do it's part in setting up that greater story.All in all, it's an entertaining, well executed, movie that I walked out of in a good mood. Given what it has to accomplish in the overall Marvel narrative, I'd say that's an accomplishment. And with the ending that it has, I'm very excited to see what is set up in this movie payoff.","6/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","frankiesilver-91836","9 July 2022","After the overly-hyped and mostly disappointing Multiverse of Madness, I tampered my expectations for Love and Thunder despite it being a direct sequel to one of my favorite Marvel movies. I was right to do so.The concept already wasn't too great. Mighty Thor is pretty dumb to begin with but Gorr was an awesome villain idea. The Jane stuff didn't end up as awful as expected, but it still felt forced and her being ""a Thor"" is just stupid.They at least try to explain it, but how Mj√∂lnir changes Jane doesn't happen to anyone else worthy. It also just makes Thor and Steve seem less special.This movie degrades Thor enough as is. He went from a humorous kickass god to now acting like a bumbling idiot. He genuinely is a parody of himself. The way the cast behaves doesn't fit the dark plot lines of Jane's cancer and a god butcher.Jane reappearing after being absent in Ragnarok felt weird. Still she looked awesome and this was probably her best appearance. I was expecting her to take over Thor's mantle permanently, but surprisingly she dies instead. I'm thankful they didn't kill off Thor, but Jane's death felt rushed and not impactful.Gorr's depiction by Christian Bale is downright wonderful. He brings his A-game, but we get very little of him. Gorr's suffering could've been fleshed out more and they could've explored the moral grey area of his goal. We get none of that. Instead we only see the GOD BUTCHER kill one god on screen, and they cut away during the decapitation! We see him terrorizing children most of his scenes, which is pleasantly terrifying but they should've done way way more with him. As it is this is a waste of both the character of Gorr and Christian Bale in the MCU.Everyone else gets next to nothing to do. The Guardians understandably leave early on, Korg and Valkeryie just tag along for nothing other than jokes and forced sexuality commnets, Lady Sif returns and is degraded as a character.No one is taken seriously for the sake of comedy. The serious opening with Gorr comes off as jarring because of this.Also the Warrior Three's deaths are made fun of and Darcy only gets one scene.Many of these jokes seem to actively be making fun of pre-Ragnarok Thor content.For a positive, I will say I loved the first act of this film. It was downright hilarious, most likely due to James Gunn collaborating with Taika. The Guardians' chemistry with Thor is awesome. By the time act 2 started I was still laughing out loud throughout, but the jokes made less sense and were either shock humor or unintentional. By the ending of the film I was just depressed at realizing this wasn't the Ragnarok 2 I expected.When you also take into account the shockingly unfinished looking CGI and special effects for Marvel standards you get a messy movie that is funny, but not well-constructed by any means.Ragnarok wasn't just funny, it had a deep, high stakes story behind it. This movie needed to not just be funny but flesh out its story and keep continuity better.This isn't the total miss that was The Dark World, but it's very much under the quality I'd expect from one of the most beloved Avengers.","4/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","benjaminskylerhill","7 July 2022","Taika Waititi amps up the zany craziness of Ragnarok to unbelievable levels in this film, both for better and for worse. The movie is often hilarious due to how unpredictably absurd it is, but sometimes suffers due to the overbearing need it seems to feel to always have jokes in every scene, regardless of whether they fit in with what's happening in the movie.But, this is nothing new for Marvel. I only bring it up because it happens far more often in this film than in any other Marvel outing.What is new in this film (and quite fresh) is the villain. Christian Bale gives a surprisingly both creepy and heartfelt performances as the God Butcher. Right from the opening we have a deep compassionate understanding for why he does what he does, and the conclusion of the story gives him a very satisfying conclusion for his journey as well.I just wish there was more of him. He gets a great introduction and a great ending in which compelling parallels are drawn between him and Thor, but throughout the rest of the movie he's just ""evil possessed guy."" The motivations are still there, but I wanted to see more of what he was doing and how his possession was affecting his mind or personality.I was worried about how Jane would be as ""Lady-Thor,"" and thankfully her presence in the movie is warranted. She's written into the story in a way that both makes sense and actually amplifies the emotional stakes, which are sadly nonexistent in a lot of these Marvel films.The action is mostly pretty good, but kind of a mixed bag. The camerawork and selective use of colors is fun and frenetic, but the overuse of CGI is sometimes far too noticeable and makes the movie look...cheap. Cheaper than any other Thor movie. Cheap is not a word I like to use when describing $200 million movies, but there isn't a better one to use for this.Endings are hard to write, and the ending of this film (no spoilers) both works and doesn't work. There's a satisfying payoff to the themes of love and loss, but at the very end the story asks us to care about Thor's relationship to a character who we have not seen and know nothing about.It's a sweet and charming ending, but it left me feeling...colder than I think the filmmakers wanted me to feel. And that's because they didn't put in any work throughout the movie to make me feel as satisfied as the characters in the movie are by the ending's outcome.I do recommend this film, for Christian Bale's performance and for Taika Waititi's very distinct (if flawed) absurd method of telling stories with a lot of humor and heart and ambition. A lot of ambition.","6/10"

Though the story may not be the strongest, and I'm sure there's some decisions made that some people may not like, I definitely had fun.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","jddv","6 July 2022","Thor 4 is going to cause quite a bit of division, with some people loving the fast pacing and humour, and others citing a lack of character development with a flippant disregard of true, life-threatening danger.In a way, they'll both be right.There will also be a never-ending comparison to Thor: Ragnarok, with some justification, as TR was Taika's first foray into the MCU and therefore a breath of fresh air; but also with the same reasoning being a caveat that we are a bit inured to Taika's originality now, and thus not as easily impressed.While I agree that the director's penchant for not wasting time on minutiae allows the story to proceed apace, it felt as though the middle of the film failed to allow the antagonist to establish his bonafides as a true threat, reduced as he was to scaring children. Without going into specifics, the ending also nullified his emotional motivation that ""All gods must die.""However, the film makes up for some of these weaker points with imaginative use of powers, props and locations. But you aren't allowed a moment to digest the more serous moments, and end up leaving the cinema feeling a bit confused and uncertain as to whether you enjoyed what you just watched. Hence the division of opinion of those who watched the film, but didn't take more time to digest what they saw.So when you do see it, give yourself a few hours to let it soak in, then decide if you feel it was worthy of your time & money.","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","seige-hound","11 July 2022","Thor Love and Thunder is two movies. The first movie is another Thor Ragnarok, a goofy Taika Waititi comedy with lots of improv and silliness. The other is a dark and gritty story about Gorr's grief for his lost child, and how it parallels Thor's grief for the impending loss of Jane.The issue is it doesn't quite balance that. I'm not sure if that's the fault of Taika Waititi's direction or producer meddling, but either way, the film is a bit 'off'.The good stuff is good. Christian Bale as Gorr is fantastic. He nails the portrayal of both the grieving father, and the corrupted evil mastermind. Jane's story as Mighty Thor is also very compelling. If I could say one thing, would be that she should've been the main focus of the movie, with regular Thor as a side character/comic relief for an otherwise dark story told straight.That, or just save the Gorr story for a later time, and have another goofy Thor comedy ala Ragnarok. Have him hang out with the guardians more or something. I don't know. The problem with this movie is that with the slightly reduced run time of 2 hours, and the inconsistent mix of tones, the film feels unfocused and rushed. Which is disappointing, because of the two stories that it used up (Gorr's and Jane's).","7/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","sentient-74528","12 July 2022","Bland story. Dull characters. I just couldn't care about them. It's a childish film, with silly jokes all over the place. Thor acts as a perfect imbecile all the time. Most of the story is about saving a bunch of children and defeating the bad guy. And of course, throw some woke nonsense to rub our noses in. The Marvel films just went slowly downhill. And I think this is the last of them I watch in the cinema. I just can't be bothered with Disney anymore. The film is so bad I can't even spoil it! It's already spoiled. Don't waste your time. Watch something else.","6/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","smkashan","6 July 2022","Overall a good movie, brilliantly directed by Taika, manages to seamlessly move back and forth between hilarious comedy and dark moments. However it falls apart a bit towards the end as the ending was quite rushed, making the film feel like 10 minutes too short. Also No Way Home's multiverse exploration has skyrocketed everyone's expectations and we kinda want to see something about the multiverse in every Marvel movie now and when that doesn't happen its a bit disappointing. Apart from that this movie is good fun!","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","7 July 2022","Let me preface this by saying that I don't really love any of the other Thor movies. Ragnarok was actually a massive misstep for me. The slapstick comedy made me eyeroll almost every time out, not at all fitting any progressive tone from the previous Thor or Avengers movies before it. After loving Jojo Rabbit, I thought that every Taika Waititi product that I didn't enjoy was some exception to his excellence, but I shortly discovered that that was the only film I did care to love from him. I started to give up hope, especially after hearing Love and Thunder only adds to the silliness that Ragnarok had.I'm here to say that the comedy this time around wasn't as maddening for me. Some of it was legitimately funny or at least served a courteous chuckle; it never interfered with the action, the villain, or serious moments; and I think the majority of jokes that fell flat passed by so quickly that I wouldn't even realize it was an attempt at humor unless somebody said it was supposed to be funny (which is never good, but it's better if it goes without a hitch). The Zeus scene was admittedly worst than the Ragnarok levels of 'bad' and really brought the movie down during the time, but thankfully that was the only time that I really felt the brunt end of failed comedy. There were two other running gags during the film -- one involving certain animals which I laughed at the more they appeared, and the other involving weapons which really didn't work except the first time it happened. They even repeat a bit from Ragnarok that I thought worked more this time around simply because it took place on Earth instead of Asgard. Upon re-reading my own paragraph I feel like I may be giving this movie more credit in its humor than I feel it's owed, but I feel this is all relative when I say: ""At least it's not as bad as expected or as previously established."" I can't see how somebody who loved Ragnarok is only now going to be upset at the knockabout that this movie at times can be.Love and Thunder introduces Jane as Mighty Thor, and although it was great to see Natalie Portman return, the dichotomy between her two selves with no in-between was very jarring. I guess in a two-hour runtime you have to accept these little nuances to be skipped time to time and she isn't the only character to undergo an immediate change like this, but if you're coming off the Phase One MCU character of Jane who you remember you would never believe she would evolve this persona. I guess that's what happens when your character lives on as you take a hiatus from the universe as an actress, though. Regardless, this story is very Jane-centric and I think it is something that Ragnarok was dearly missing. She helps complete Thor, or at least for a life that Thor pines for. There is a backstory montage showing a relationship between Thor and Jane (almost in an ""never before seen footage"" kind of way) that displayed more chemistry between them than either Thor or The Dark World bothered to give off. Like I said, very heartfelt.This actually is a good transition to Gorr, because his origins are also derived from the love of another as well. This movie does that thing that the show House M. D. did (where a patient with a certain quirk delivered thematically for the doctors in the episode), so what was happening with Thor was also happening with Gorr regarding their attachment to the loved ones in their lives. It doesn't play like this for the whole movie, but it is still a present theme. Christian Bale is really good, but I'm not sure if he has enough moments to show this. He both frontends and bookends the film very strongly and shows up here and there with shadowy minions, and he is absolutely a dominant presence every time he is on screen, but I definitely could have had more of him. He is never served as cannon fodder for Waititi's comedy, so his scenes are always serious and impactful. His monologues are very captivating and will get a lot of clicks on YouTube, and the action set pieces with him are very diverse and engaging.I'll restate that Thor never really was my favorite, and unfortunately it could be because he isn't Earthbound. Any time this character is off of our planet, losing that grounded aspect really takes away from it all for me. Never before had I imagined after seeing the first Iron Man film that we would get to a point where we'd have rainbow bridges and rock-bodied aliens, and that can be detracting for me. That said, the Earth scenes here once again grabbed me most (as well as the scenes with the colorless portrayal, you'll know when you get to it) and the off-world stuff did not (especially once again the Zeus scene). When Asgard was destroyed in Ragnarok I thought that was the best thing that could happen to this franchise if it meant more Earth scenes. There are some scenes away from Earth with nice grounded conversation, and these are the moments that almost reminded me of what Jojo Rabbit did so well. Valkyrie was also normalized a lot in this movie and I dug her every time she was on screen because of it.Despite some of the cringe that was afoot, I had a good time with this sequel. Given that I do not relatively enjoy the Thor films as much as many of the other MCU films, I can easily put this above the other three myself. It was a visual delight, the music was well done, the actors all gave good performances, and characters had solid arcs to play out. Furthermore, I like that it was two hours and they didn't needlessly add in other characters which didn't fit this story, even if they were a part of previous Thor films. I won't say this movie completely fuses the humor to my liking for this character, but the movie itself is the best/most entertaining of Thor that I have seen so I suppose I am accepting of it.","10/10"

I'm shocked how many reviewers can't count past one, because production value alone is worth at least five stars. I really wasn't expecting much with all the negativity, but wow was I pleasantly surprised! Just when I thought the industry ran out of superhero writing ideas, this little gem comes along, and we were all in tears laughing so hard. Even the story-telling narration was a brilliant touch and elevated the plot and the laughs. The entire screenplay had everything and something for everyone. The humor, the romance, family dynamics, and so on, everything imo was perfection. All casting and performances were outstanding. The almost 2 hour runtime flew by with the excellent pacing. The set designs, S/VFX and cinematography were amazing. The score and soundtrack were spot-on. I can't wait to see this one again, as it's now one of my favorite superhero films of all time. If you haven't seen it, ignore the whiners, this is one heck of a fun, entertaining and hilarious popcorn flick. It's a 9.5 rounded up to a perfect 10/10 from me.","7/10"

Not anymore. My daughter refused to go to Love and Thunder, she kept saying her friends hated it. I insisted and we just went to see it. Such a disappointment.The humor on Ragnarok was cleverly played. Action, story, Chris Hemsworth, excitement was all to the point. But Love and Thunder is like a bad middle school play, it is NOT funny, it is not exciting, it is not even a ""meh"" movie. I found myself regretting paying for the movie tickets. I don't want to watch a loser superhero, I don't want to see overly comics looking outfits, bad hair extensions, great actors doing terrible accents. I don't want stair skipping, skirt holding Zeus. Superhero movies were special because I wanted to feel those fight scenes, the emotions, the fear, the power of the winning. I don't think I rolled my eyes this much in a movie before.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","OnlyAtJMart","8 July 2022","So this had promise. Even though Gorr wasn't comic accurate, Bale did a good job, but the script was bad. With what he ultimately wanted, the whole movie could have been solved with a conversation. ""Hey I need Stormbreaker to have Eternity exchange lives so I can sacrifice myself to bring my daughter back to life, and I need someone to keep her safe. I have the Necrosword, and don't want to do this the hard, violent way."" Boom, whole movie was unnecessary. Also, lots of overuse of Guns and Roses. Does every action scene have to have ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" other than the one time they used November Rain? Plus they bring Jane Foster back, just to kill her off? The visuals were good, but the writing was bad. Very one dimensional. Phase 4 is probably the worst phase of the MCU so far. I really hope they see that it's been underwhelming, and get some better writers moving forward. As a big fan of the MCU, I hate to say all this, but they can do better.","5/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","newguy85","14 July 2022","I gave Ragnarok a 10 and it's one of the only MCU movies I seek out for repeat viewings. It's stylish, hilarious, balanced, and treats the source material with dignity.I saw the trailer for Love and Thunder and immediately wanted to see it opening night, which I rarely do anymore, but thought this warranted a big-screen viewing.Without spoilers, my opinion of what we got is too much silliness and irreverence and poor writing, pacing and plot in the first half of the movie that dampens the very exciting and fun second half.A very important plot point happens in the cold open in a very fast vision, and multiple plot developments happen off camera, yet we get a multiple moments of on-screen gags like Natalie Portman coming up with catch phrases, Stormbreaker being jealous of Mjolnir, the Zeus lightning bolt show from the trailer, and easily ten minutes of goofy flashbacks narrated by Korg that get old really fast. There are times that it apparent that director Waititi just likes the sound of his own voice (as Korg)As for the acting: Christian Bale's Gorr is the only character that works; Natalie Portman looks out of place and amateur trying to be Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson barely gets a line in despite being King of New Asgard, Russell Crowe's Zeus sounds like Borat and made his scenes unwatchable, and Chris Hemsworth goes full himbo Thor.Where Ragnarok felt like a love-note to comics, Love and Thunder felt like everyone involved believes Marvel Comics and the MCU are undignified and something to be mocked.As for content, if you are taking kids be aware that there is a lot of sexually charged dialogue, a scene about orgies and when Chris Hemsworth is disrobed a lot of jokes about the size of his genitalia.","6/10"

Maybe this is the best way forward for certain MCU stories, to make the plot more light-hearted, silly from which the plot has more qualities of a comic book adaptation than a separated entity from it's roots.

Probably like 10 reference of gay couples were made including the stone dude. Yes, believe it. Disney is causing Star Wars and Marvel real fans to get tired. They are more worried about the ""being inclusive war"" than doing good writing and directing. Spider-Man showed that they don't need to be woke in order to do a quality job.

The action scenes are energetic and fun to watch. There's also a certain weight to them, which sometimes can be lost via the CGI.3. There are some comedic moments, particularly when Thor (Chris Hemsworth) gets to jest back-and-forth with other characters.4. The horror aspect was well-implemented, and genuinely provided some tense moments.5. Chris Hemsworth gives his usual upbeat and jovial take on Thor. It's clear he's become at ease with the character.Cons:
1. The Guardians feature in the film for about 10 minutes, and then pointlessly disappear for plot convenience. This is especially annoying as they feature heavily in the trailer.2. Most of the humour comes across as if it was written by a seven-year old.3. The movie is tonally confused half the time. It inserts a plethora of jokes, and then tries to ram in a supposed serious moment, only to place a few jokes after said serious moment. It thus makes the jokes fall flat, and the serious moments feel hollow.4. Tessa Thompson's acting is some of the stalest and one-dimensional that I have ever seen.5. A lot of the special effects are distractingly bad. It's incredibly obvious that a lot of the scenes take place in front of a green screen.6. During the final fight scene, Thor conveniently turns the kidnapped kids into essentially mini-Thors. It's bizarre that this ability has suddenly turned up, as it would have come in handy against Thanos.7. Korg is starting to become like the Minions from Despicable Me (2010); funny at first, but is fast starting to outstay his welcome.","8/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","brianlespoir","9 July 2022","I didn't like the fate of one particular character and it's story. The comedy part was a bit to childish, too much, like a grown man went to far or didn't know how to be funny and sometimes not original.Bale was awesome, we want more Gorr. Not enough time for one movie.Still had a great time at the movies with some nice people.","5/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","nzfade","6 July 2022","I enjoyed it, I think the last movie was better, as this gets a little too silly.....kids will love it though with the goofiness.I think the reason it looses points is theirs no consequences.... I thought they took chances with people dying.....but no, just retconned in the end.Thor never really appeared to be in any danger.Lady Thor was great, she definitely connected with the role, and put in a solid performance.Probably the weakest part was Korg.....I didn't like how they used his narrating a story to drive the plot......it almost became a parody of the movie itself.Pretty solid, I think the last one hit the beats better, and Christian Bale puts in an amazing performance as the villian.","8/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","BrnzReviews","17 August 2022","Thor Love & Thunder was an entertaining movie as far as Thor movies are expected to be, although I felt this movie focused and relied more on the comedic side of things rather than diving deeper into the characters origin. Gorr The God Butcherer (Christian Bale) was magnificent, truly a standout performance. Chris Hemsworth is great at playing Thor, he invests alot into the role as we've seen over the years and hopefully more to come.I'll admit I was skeptical at first in the decision of bringing Jane Foster/Lady Thor back into the mix as her character has had no relevant screen time to the story for many years but I was wrong, she was brilliant. I couldn't help but ponder where Loki was, I was expecting a reunion/ a confirmation of Lokis possible survival for Thor but nothing. I know its all a plan and I have faith it will be incredible! I can't wait to see Thor return on the big screen, I'd highly recommend this one, not the best ever but still very entertaining!","2/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","pranayjalvi","9 July 2022","Love and Thunder was chaotic, all over the place, messy, filed with lots of weird dialogues and punchline with a not so strong storyline.The film is particularly disappointing given that it's directed by Taika Waititi, the nimbly funny New Zealander who made Thor's previous installment, Ragnarok, a smash hit and generally has a strong track record of mixing tones, swerving from silly to sentimental with practiced ease.The return of a major actor such as Portman should feel compelling, but she's simply part of some busy wallpaper. Bale and Crowe are instead the film's biggest standouts, because they dare to supersize their performances.To summarise, Love and Thunder offers the usual lightning-streaked action and tossed-off gags, but this time, there's not enough heft behind the flashiness.My Rating: 4.5/10.","6/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","cricketbat","17 September 2022","The Thor movies can't seem to get the balance right. Thor was serious, Thor 2 was too serious. Thor: Ragnarok was goofy, and Thor: Love and Thunder is too goofy. It feels like kids wrote the screenplay. Its tone is wildly inconsistent, the story doesn't make a lot of sense, and they maybe should have cut a joke or two instead of leaving in everything every writer submitted. When screaming goats are the funniest thing about your film, you should probably try some rewrites. I did smirk a few times, and Christian Bale really puts some effort into his character, but this Thor: Love and Thunder mostly fell flat for me.","7/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","hazelZD16","6 July 2022","Marvel have going downgrade lately. Quantity Over quality? Thats facts. This movie have a potential to be the coolest and amazing thor movie. But turns out its just another overhyped movie with mediocre story. I know this movie just build up for greater upcoming story. But why? Sacrificing a movie with great potential just to make another mediocre movie? Im afraid mcu have gone too far. U can see the quality since iron man 1 and endgame. After that? Nothing. Thor L&T have unstable CGI, Forced Joke, And lacks of depth on storytelling. I can't believe this movie have many plot hole. Like who know heimdall have son? Who know that thor ca lend his power for limited time or forever? Who know what happen to gorr before his daughter died? Or what happen to his race and wife? Why gorr only ask his daughter but not wife to eternity. Or maybe ask his whole race to be resurrected? Or maybe thats not how its worked? Whole MCU Phase 4 is nothing but A ""LOVE"" Story. Almost every movie they put in Phase 4 the main story of the movie is about love and regrets. I wanna know more about gorr backstory but i guess it will never happen eh? Or maybe someday his daughter will tell the story. And i want to know necrosword origin? They dont even tell us about that, just straight to gorr mighty sword to kill gods. Im worried that marvel have run out of ideas for their movies. Like the story for this movie its just not it. Now we come to post credit part. First post credit scene? Zeus told His son ""Hercules"" to kill thor odinson. Which im pretty sure we gonna wait another 5-6 Years just to see him again in theatre. Anyway Welcome to MCU Brett Goldstein (Hercules). Second post credit? Jane in valhalla and met heimdall. If im being honest they should leave this valhalla thing alone. Let the one who died just died. Shouldnt show us they physically alive in valhalla because its just ruined the emotional moment we get from the dead of asgardian. Is Thor L&T Good Movie? No.Is Thor L&T A Bad Movie? No.Is This movie better than recent Mcu movies? Idk
Because they all look the same.Peak performance for christian bale gorr
and natalie portman jane foster. Top Notch performance for both of them.","4/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","fraser-simons","10 September 2022","This worked for me more so than Ragnarok. It's a bit more silly, but also far more serious in many ways. The comedic beats worked and they're better balanced with other emotions. It's also just gorgeous in 4K HDR. Each new movie seems to out do the previous, making it an absolute feast for the eyes and ears. I had a blast watching it and I think it's more enjoyable than the previous Thor movies. None of them are particularly exploring anything deep. What thematics are present are done well, though. Just enough awkward ex stuff, screaming goats. The ending felt a lot more interesting than most of these flicks, that's for sure.","4/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","sbweightman","8 July 2022","An underwhelming film which should have been awesome, especially with the soundtrack during the iconic battle scenes, but it all felt a bit flat. The special effects were colorful but blurry, the humour rarely landed, the silly moments were too silly, the battle scenes too dark and the emotionally moving and horror moments didn't fit with the light hearted bumbling superhero vibe. The plot was good with a well-rounded villain and the acting performances were good, but overall, it was nothing special and I was bored by the third act.","6/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","becky-92346","17 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) follows Thor as he goes up against a new villain who aims to kill all gods. He enlists the help of his friends, and a new unexpected hero. Unfortunately I really wasn't a fan of this film, and I just ended up getting really bored while watching it!Firstly, the cinematography was fairly decent but there wasn't much to talk about. I really enjoyed the black-and-white that was used in the film, it was tasteful and set an interesting tone. My main issue in terms of visuals comes with the CGI, which I thought was poor and some of the worst we've seen in the MCU so far. I'd expect more, as they obviously had the budget needed.The acting was good, and the characters continue to be as loveable as they always were. Chris Hemsworth is charismatic as Thor, and Natalie Portman really put her all into her performance, however I feel her character was rushed and wasted. Christian Bale was intriguing as the new villain but once again, I feel his backstory was rushed and felt incredibly basic.The humour for this film felt forced, and I much preferred Taika's approach in the previous film, Thor: Ragnarok (2017). This was a shame as I really enjoyed Waititi's previous works. A few of the jokes made me cringe, which most definitely wasn't what I expected.The music was fitting, but Guns N Roses seemed to be almost the only music used, therefore it got old quite quickly and had less of an effect as the film went on. I can't really remember the score, so I feel unable to comment on that.Lastly, the pacing was messy, and the tone was confusing. The film was both fast and slow, but It didn't balance it very well, and the film completely lost tension for me because of this. My biggest problem was that I couldn't tell what tone the film was going for, and the tonal shifts were too often and abrupt.","4/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","triannouvtecson","6 July 2022","So far, the story concept was nice in this film. But the only problem was the script writing. The story wasn't better than it was before.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","asaracchio","6 July 2022","I went to the cinema to see a nice movie and that's how it was. This Thor movie is very cute, entertaining, the movie lasts two hours which are spent pleasantly. It never gets boring and the pace is fast.","5/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","snowadian","10 July 2022","What did I just watch... very disappointed. This movie was only about half as good as Ragnarok.Korg wasn't anywhere near as funny as he was last time, and for some reason, now is a pile of rocks that has a sexual preference?The CGI was absolutely awful - the worst yet in any MCU movie. Those other gods were total trash.Crowe was so out of place it was jarring. Hated his character.Bale's character was really good, but he needed a better movie, his gritty character and story arc did not mesh well with goofy Thor and company.Thor seems like he is no longer the strongest character in his own movies, he's become comic relief to powerful females characters.I gave Ragnarok a 10/10, Taika, you failed me on this one!","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","matthewynlin","6 July 2022","A casual MCU fan would find Thor: Love and Thunder to be more than enjoyable, arguably having the most character development in any solo Marvel Project. I would assume the vast majority of fans would rank this film better than Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness but worse than Spider-Man No Way home. It does not live up to the standard of the last Thor movie but sides as one of the better MCU films. Waititi 's iconic humor does not disappoint in this film and is filled with top notch action scenes; Bale's depiction of Gorr the god butcher is impeccable; However the film fails to move the MCU's broader narrative forward and leaves fan asking did this film have any impact on anything and anyone.","3/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","Carycomic","9 July 2022","If so, I have to say that I was relieved when the attempts at being comedic finally stopped! The attempted pep talks by Hemsworth as Thor were especially unfunny. To paraphrase the late, great Lloyd Bentsen: ""I've heard inspirational speeches by the original Capt. America, Mr. Odinson. And you, sir, are no Capt. America!""I also wasn't amused by Russell Crowe's portrayal of Zeus. I mean, if he was going to adopt a mock-Italian accent for the character, a la Chico Marx, he might as well have used the ancient Roman name of Jupiter!On the upside, I did enjoy the bittersweet reunion with Jane Foster (a.k.a. Thordis). And the flashback narrated
by Korg (a.k.a. The Stone Man of Krona) certainly helped explain why she and Thor broke up in between ""...Dark World"" and ""...Ragnarok.""I also enjoyed the cameo appearance of the Celestials during the hasty exit from Omnipotent City; the Zeusettes' disappointment at Thor having his toga restored; and the arguement between Thor and Axel over the latter's refusal to go by his birth name of ""Astrid"" anymore.*As for the mid-credit cameo ""hinting"" that the next Thor sequel will feature the character of Hercules? Kind of a mixed blessing, as Brett Goldstein boasts neither the musculature of Steve Reeves nor Kevin Sorbo! Plus; if Thor returned to the apartment to read her good-bye note, then Jane definitely and undeniably left first.In short; if you can stand the lame jokes by Hemsworth, go see it. If you can't; wait to download it from pay-per-view so you can fast-forward past the agonizing dialogue of the intended ""humor.""*Nor can I honestly blame him. Isn't that a Scandinavian girl's name?","7/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","pivan01","11 July 2022","In all fairness a truer rating would be between 5* and 6*, but it might eventually get there. At this point, I'm very tempted to believe a good percentage of the ratings are not genuine; the comments reflect a much grimmer situation.I'm not even going to comment on the movie itself, but on the approach and wokeness is written everywhere.The world does not need protection from fictional, unreal things. So worry less about how not to offend people and be more inclusive, instead worry about how to encourage and motivate them to overcome their weakness and reach their true potential by reflecting a world that is true and in that world people need protection from wars, viruses, incompetent governments, inflation, raising costs of living and so on.","5/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","RaidersOfTheLostCommunist","10 July 2022","This movie moves really fast, things are quickly glanced over or just given a quick explanation. Too much jokes, I would say that having a lot of people talking and trying to be funny doesn't work. Maybe 2 out of every 5 jokes are funny. Guardians are barely in this movie so don't expect a Thor and Guardian team up.The tone is kinda inconsistent, with serious moments getting interrupted by that tradition ""Marvel comedy."" There is no real threat, Christian Bale is great but all he does is say stereotypical evil villain monologues. His fights scenes are good though, I will admit. He has a good backstory but his transition from grieving guy to main villain was lame and quick. It happens within the first 5 minutes. One second he is a normal guy, the very next he suddenly changes his looks an is now a super villain.Natalie Portman and Tessa Thombson are good in this movie, and they get almost as much screen time as Thor. I would say the ending involving a battle with kids and shadow monsters was kinda lame, it suddenly turns into a little kids movie. Seriously, it feels like a (ahem) ""Disney movie.""Overall this is a good action movie with great effect and some good acting, but if you are looking for some deep story or stuff like that, it ain't here.7/10.","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","Data-1001","9 September 2022","I don't know if Waititi was overworked or what, but it's the direction more than anything which ruins this movie's potential.The actors are trying way too hard with the comedy instead of letting it flow naturally -- which good direction could've put a stop to.And Bale's scenery-chewing also needed to be reined in quite a bit. When every single line is played over-the-top, they all lose their impact. Subtlety would have gone a long way with him.The other thing about the comedic beats -- most of which completely fall flat -- is not due to the actors' delivery but the directorial choices of how the scenes are shot.Even the Guardians of the Galaxy, who can usually be counted on for solid humor, came across poorly in this.A better edit might have made this more enjoyable, but not by much. The damage was done before the film was in the can, so to speak.","4/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","amason-6","8 July 2022","It pains me to give this movie a rating of one star, but after watching less than 15 minutes, I actually thought to myself, ""who wrote this crap""? And yes, I'm looking at you Taika Waititi - it may be time to hang up your pen! This movie has some good talent in it, so it's a shame they were treated like idiots with poor dialogue, too many bad jokes that fell flat, and a plot that needed a major overhaul.Fat Thor turns into buff Thor and gets his very own nude scene - but relax ladies, he's only shown from behind. There were so many bad lines and lame jokes that I can't even pick out just one, but hey, at least Thor got to play a caricature of his former self!Smart Jane Foster turns into cancer ridden Jane, who then turns into Female Thor. Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, which was crushed to pieces by Hela, becomes whole again and is instructed by Thor to protect Jane. Apparently Mjolnir didn't understand and instead turns her into Female Thor whenever she picks up the hammer. Jane has new strength and hopes that a miracle will heal her. Unbeknownst to her, the hammer is actually drawing her remaining strength out, leaving her body unable to fight off the progressing cancer. Thor and Jane rekindle their love, only to be separated permanently by Jane's untimely death. Also, it looks like Jane became more godlike than human, because she joins other dead Asgardians in Valhalla.The Guardians of the Galaxy make an unremarkable appearance at the beginning of the film, but they are totally ineffectual until Thor shows up and saves the day. Say goodbye to the Guardians.Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) turns into King Valkyrie instead of Queen, without any real reason given. She's not given enough to do and is rather a wasted character, which is a shame.One of the better characters is Gorr (Christian Bale) who turns into the ""god butcher"" after being chosen by the Necrosword, and sets out to kill all gods. He also isn't given enough screen time and also becomes a wasted character.Funny rock guy Korg turns into the unfunny and annoying ""Jar Jar Binks"" of this movie. (writer/director and voice of Korg, Mr. Waititi makes sure to give himself plenty of dialogue) I found myself just wishing Korg would shut up and die, but even after being reduced to rubble, his dang face remains in one piece and he can still talk! Later on he appears to have ""regrown"" himself and he's back in one piece.Zeus (Russell Crowe) can't decide if he's an all powerful god, or just a simpering weakling who picks up his short ""skirt"" as he sashays down a few steps. I guess he was just showing off his ""feminine side"". Thor called him the most powerful god, but they cast an out of shape, flabby Crowe to play the part. Crowe also assumes the most atrocious accent and ends up sounding like a Greek mafia king, who turns out to be neither a strong nor benevolent god.There also seemed to be a lot of confusion as to who or which weapon was the strongest. First it's female Thor and her hammer, then it's male Thor and his axe, then it's Zeus and his golden lightning bolt, or it's Gorr and his Necrosword. In order to blur the lines between all of them, the movie used darkness, shadows, and a whole lot of CGI for the fight scenes so it didn't matter anyway.Disney continues to further its ""anything goes"" stance by bringing out how Korg had 2 fathers who got together and produced him. Then there's Valkyrie who admits to loving another woman, and let's not forget how everyone was invited to a giant, fun loving orgy by Zeus. It seems the mighty Zeus would rather use his strength for lots of sex, rather than save a bunch of innocent children from death by Necrosword.This movie had so much potential but it never lived up to it. I love the Marvel Universe and all its characters. They deserved so much better than this mishmash of tripe. I really wanted to like this movie, but felt let down on every level. Shame on you Disney. I'm sure Stan Lee is turning over in his grave.","1/10"

It had so much potential to be epic, especially with Jane coming back in as Thor. But there was zero Marvel magic to it, and her story was completely overlooked and rushed.Bale was the only worthy thing about this monstrosity, but his character and performance were completely wasted.Don't bother seeing it until its free on Disney+, and even then, make sure you're drunk so you don't remember it the next day !!","1/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","cinistersynthicate","7 July 2022","With review I'm going to try and not speak about anything to do with comic book accuracy, mainly because in short you can definitely throw any of that out of the window with this movie, and instead I am going to just focus on the film itself and why I don't like it. First of all I just want to say that Thor Love & Thunder is the first ever comic book film I watched where there felt like there was nearly zero at stake. The tone of the movie is just so all over the place, the dialogue was something that my 8 year old nephew could come up with, the story seemed good on paper but was not executed well and that could be because there might be a lot of things removed, the pacing just made me feel like I was watching this for almost three hours when in all reality it was among one of the shortest of the Marvel films. Wrap up all of these issues into one big bow and you got a product that feels like actually two separate films in one movie. I briefly scrolled through some of the other reviews on here and saw plenty of complaints this time around on Thor's personality, and how he's just in a full on idiotic form. In recent years, I have been feeling very strongly about this matter and it is in full effect within Love and Thunder to the point that it is blatantly obvious. As someone who did not care for Ragnarok I was not expecting a majority the humor to resonate well with me, I wont lie and say it was totally and purely awful, I think Waititi definitely nails the Guardians of the galaxy's humor well, not as much the Thor humor though. I didn't find most of the jokes in the movie funny and I think its safe to say that it appeared that my screening did not find most of the jokes funny either between the friend I attended with actually expressing to me he felt like he was almost ""forced to laugh"" at many of the jokes and the lack of the audience expressing a sign of laughter on most of the jokes. As it is, for whatever reason it may be, the runtime was restrictive enough as it was in a movie with a lot to accomplish, If only more time was focused on developing certain plot points, relationships, characters (especially Gorr the not-so-God butcher), and adding necessary details instead of focusing what joke they could nail next, I believe the impact that the audience was supposed to feel walking out at the end would have been greater, made more sense, and maybe even I would have liked it more.","6/10"

Really? These stories are just empty and dumb at some point. If Thor was able to just transmit his powers to anyone... why didn't we ever see this? Why he didn't do that during the last stand with Thanos so all the Avengers were OP? Now Infinity what the hell... I mean if this thing existed why never mentioned it? Why when he got his new hammer on IW instead of going to Wakanda to do nothing or at least help Tony... why didn't he go to infinity and asked for Thanos to forget about the stones. Why does Greg or Gorr or whatever his name is wished for her daughter to live if he knew how crappy was everything and either way he was going to die he wouldn't be able to be with his daughter cause now she's alive and he dead. You dumb Greg, I mean why bring his daughter back to life? Why he didn't say that Jane's cancer get deleted so she could be with Thor why would Thor care about that kid whom by the way is a terrible actress her dad dies and she couldn't care less.

I'm predisposed to enjoy comic book movies because I remember an era when all we got was Ron Ely as Doc Savage -- and we liked it -- and fake Iron Man TV movies like Exo-Man, so I always wonder when people dislike these movies for reasons -- that I'll get into -- it kind of makes me wonder how filmgoers went from being so afraid of the train in The Great Train Robbery and then a few years later didn't think motion pictures were dark magic and started saying, ""Oh, this is kind of boring.""Mining the work of comic book writer Jason Aaron -- having Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) gain the hammer and powers of Thor as she battles cancer; Gorr the God Butcher attacking gods throughout time and space -- director, co-writer (with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson) and co-star (as Korg) Taika Waititi has created a movie that is as much about Thor (Chris Hemsworth) seeking his identity as it is superheroics.Gorr lost his daughter and realized he was the last being left on his planet. After praying for salvation to the god Rapu, he discovered that the gods no longer care or hear these pleas. He discovers a weapon called the Necrosword and immediately slays that god, deciding that there's no need for them. You know, kind of like how we have monarchs and leaders who beg so much of us with no return.Thor has been with the Guardians of the Galaxy, who have begun to tired of him and a call from Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander) informs him that Gorr the God Butcher is coming to Asgard to destroy any of the gods who survived. It's intriguing that while Thor took Gorr's arm in their first comic book battle, Gorr takes hers.Asgard has become a tourist spot and Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) has begun to miss the life of combat she once savored, instead being trapped by bureaucracy. Gorr is a threat she can handle more easily than red tape, so she dives into the battle, soon joined by Jane as Thor, Thor's friend Korg, two braying space goats named Toothgrinder and Toothgnasher, and Thor himself, carrying Stormbreaker, a hammer that begins to grow jealous of its owner's old weapon.Gorr ends up kidnapping the children of Asgard and makes his way to find Eternity, the being in the center of the universe that he can ask to end the gods. Thor and his friends head to the Galactic Senate on Coruscant -- err, I mean Omnipotence City. There, they petition Zeus (Russell Crowe) for help, but start to realize that maybe Gorr went on his mission to end the gods with good reason.The movie is, at the end, about the love that binds us to people and defines us more than hitting shadow creatures with axes and hammers. The tone may vary throughout the film, as major threats are joked at throughout the film, a fact that was embraced in Thor: Ragnarok and yet disliked here. I've ever read comments that people wanted the entire film to be like the dark opening as Gorr loses his daughter and I wonder, ""Have they ever seen a summer blockbuster with four Guns 'n Roses songs blaring on the soundtrack?""Christian Bale is what made this movie, playing a role that finds him frightening children and laying powerful gods low. After The Dark Night Rises he claimed he'd never make another superhero film, but his children begged him to be in this. I hope they have the action figure of their dad; he's one of the best -- if not the best -- Marvel Cinematic Universe villains, one that may be more right and devoted to his cause than Thor, whose only cause is his own life for most of the film.I also loved that Korg starts and ends the film almost as a riff on Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, telling the children of the adventures of a legend. His constant fumbling as he tells the tale is actually pretty endearing. And hey -- any space Viking ship that names its bar after Cocktails & Dreams, the one Tom Cruise works at in Cocktail -- is going to make me laugh.Are people tired of superhero movies? Sure. But they're the reason to leave our homes and go see a movie. This is the natural evolution of the summer blockbuster and if big studios could have made a Star Wars every few months, they would have. As for most comic book fans, we get it. We get hundreds of new blockbusters released every Wednesday at comic shops and keep thousands of characters and timelines and alternate realities straight. I just wonder what people expect from movies now and what would make them happy. Honestly, I get the feeling that some people instantly dislike a movie just because they need something to kvetch about. Then again, I'm a forgiving lover of 80s sword and sorcery movies, Jack Kirby and neon colors on film. So maybe I was predisposed to like this.That said -- I never thought that I'd see so many Celestials -- much less one -- in a movie. Yes, I realize they were in The Eternals, but seeing so much of this movie is like reading through old issues of Journey Into Mystery. Sometimes, you just need to enjoy things, find the good and love the feeling of summertime, when movies just want to entertain you.","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","hectordanielbuelna","9 July 2022","Chris, Bale and Portman are at the top of their acting in here. There are a bunch of scenes where they really transmit their sadness, their passion and their hate. I really liked that. There wasn't enough of it, sadly. Disney's sticking to the old Marvel formula of ruinning a beautiful scene with a dumb joke or a funny gag and then looking directly at the camera going ""hahaha did you expect that joke about rocks making babies in the middle of a deeply emotional character scene?"". Horrible.I just didn't like it at all.This movie is made for kids. It was so much better when the movie was in my mind, now that I've actually seen it I'm beyond dissapointed. But I'm finally done with the MCU so hooray! I have zero interest in any of the upcoming movies. So now I can save my money and maybe buy some good books instead.","5/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","dupregalaxy","6 July 2022","Unfortunately the film itself seems to be quite underwhelming.Whilst the stars and co-stars continue with the similar style of performance as previously seen, the story itself seems to be lacking a drawcard that stimulates the hunger for more. The climax is quite anti-climatic and the cgi in itself seems to be of poor quality considering what we have seen in previous films.The introduction of the mighty Zeus could have illustrated a bit more raw power as opposed to introducing a comic, that could possible be taken out by Hawkeye if given the chance.The light hearted comedy observed in Ragnarok was well balanced whilst not detracting from the story. In Love and Thunder it feels that some of the comedic moments are forced, and that the emphasis of the movie is to create laughs rather than build up the anxiety and tension that you would expect Christian Bale's character to create, or feel any emotion between Thor and Mighty Thor.If you are not in any hurry, wait until the Disney+ release.Perhaps better luck in the next instalment.","5/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","prbessette","19 July 2022","With such star power and serious acting ability how on earth didn't somebody yell STOP? This isn't working! Write a script worthy of the actors who clearly did their job in preparation for this mess. All the blame for the much anticipated and highly hyped Thor: Love and Thunder lays at the feet of its director/writer Taika Waititi and I can't believe I had to write that. Often brilliant, all I could think of was why he didn't pass if he didn't want to make another Thor movie! I'm actually worried that someone will get the wrong impression that there isn't a story to tell about Thor when I'd pay to see this one again with a good script and with proper use of the available talent. These movies are made for young teens and enjoyed by adults and this turned me back into an early teen stomping my feet and yelling in my head at the screen for the lame jokes, the pitiful use of Russell Crowe, the tragedy of the lack of use of Christian Bale, (he finally has been given the right role to bother with a Marvel movie and you butcher his story?), the very indifferent story given to Natalie Portman to address the situation she is living in, and on and on. Why were The Guardians even there? Another complete waste! How do you manage to waste Chris Pratt and Brad Cooper too? Not to mention the star!! Hemsworth worked unbelievably hard to prepare for this movie and even he was wasted in this nothing burger, poorly conceived and genuinely indifferent direction with no story, certainly not one worth telling, of what could shoulda woulda been THE blockbuster of the summer! WHO LET THIS HAPPEN!! I'm very worried that the wrong people will get the idea that there isn't a Thor story left to tell when this actor, who has basically dedicated his career to playing him and cares every bit as much as Benedict Cumberbatch does about portraying Dr. Strange, won't get credit where it's due because so much trust was placed in the wrong director because he had a hit with Ragnerok. He keeps saying he didn't want to make it again when that's exactly what he did! This story called for a script that took the material seriously, including humour that hit the target instead of lame 6 year old jokes! And mostly it needed the time, that extra 40 minutes given to Dr. Strange, to fully give Gorr the time he needed to show us his rage and anguish becoming the God Butcher, there's never been an actor better qualified to play a character with the depth of this one (think Oscar Isaac as Moon Knight, where was Christian Bale's chance to bring his incredible performance out of the shadow because he was robbed of story time?). And also time to truly let us feel that Natalie's Jane Foster was the love of Thor's life who this all powerful god could do nothing to save? Where was their moment? Honestly Mr. Waititi, I don't think you wanted to make another Thor movie period and you should have been big enough to pass on it or get help when you knew your script wasn't nearly enough to properly serve the characters in a movie that clearly WASN'T Ragnerok but an epic tale which you admittedly said you filled with every single suggestion received by 6 year olds. How could you? How do you sleep? You're the king of comedy in New Zealand but you're more than that, you can be overly silly but you're extremely intelligent and must have known this was headed off the rails early enough to save it from a near complete disaster! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???","4/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","DasGlasperlenspiel","20 July 2022","Visually it is still opulent. But the story is full of the dumbest silliness imaginable. The scenes with 'Zeus' are downright annoying. Thor (and the MCU) are apparently told to the end.","3/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","eddidvd","12 July 2022","I really wanted to enjoy it, but it made me want to leave after 20 minutes. I am actually appalled at the amount of good reviews online. I know the movie is supposed to be light hearted and a comedy, but it still fails in an astonishing fashion. IT IS SIMPLY NOT FUNNY. I was not the only one to think so either. It was really painful to hear the silence in the cinema after most of the supposed ""jokes"". The pacing was terrible as well, with most of the movie not driven by plot points but by what jokes Taika Waititi found funny; some were rehashed old jokes as well. There are good actors in this movie but their characters are stupid and too goofy for us to appreciate them. Thankfully, Anthony Hopkins' character is dead, otherwise we would have heard him tell fart jokes. The dialogue is the worst part by far, with most lines sounding like they were written by 4th graders. Bale is an amazing actor and his character was one of only good things about the movie; however, his ark was also understandably limited and a little superficial. The random cliche cgi monsters did not help the movie either.I would have been satisfied with a simple parody-like superhero movie, however this one failed completely in almost every aspect.PS: I think the movie should be rated somewhere around the 5/10 range but I gave it a 1/10 because of how much I disagree with the current rating.","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","samquinn2006","6 July 2022","I really really wanted to love this but I just couldn't. Chris Hemsworth is perfect in the role as ever and there are some fun scenes and lines but overall it just feels formulaic and, at times, kinda boring.The Jane Foster storyline works well but the Valkyrie character is just reduced to stupid and Christian Bale's bad guy is just a silly joke with no real menace or threat.I'm still happy I went to see it but wish it had been so much better.","2/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","tmcmaster-67512","13 July 2022","Marvel has finally jumped the shark. They have had no idea what to do with their product after Engame. I thought this would have something to do with the multiverse seeing as that's the route they've decided to take but nope, nothing here on that whatsoever.The film is essentially a ""comedy"" but not one joke was funny. I laughed at the movie rather than with it. This movie really pointed out that these movies are very goofy and should be not taken seriously as with older films. The scene with Russell Crowe, I laughed so hard at the embarrassment all these actors must've felt doing it. In front of a giant green screen acting like complete fools to entertain no one.Speaking of the CGI, I'm not sure where Disney put all their money into this because is wasn't for the CGI. Everything and I mean everything in this movie is built In a computer. I'm pretty sure even the hospital scenes with Natalie Portman were in a green screen room. At one point in the first act Thor & Mighty Thor are talking and I swear they digital deaged both Natalie Portman & Chris Hemsworth to make them look better. I know they do this in movies now to get rid of wrinkles and stuff but it was so blatant and distracting I couldn't help but be baffled at what I was seeing. This is by far the worst effects I've seen in a marvel film hands down.That leads me to the action scenes, first of where were they? Whenever someone had to fight I honestly could care less. It was so boring and the villains shadow monsters were completely trash and forgettable. The action is not existent in this. It's really beautiful people standing in front of a green screen improvising every single word of dialog. I'm truly embarrassed for this film.So Thor, he honestly should've ended his screen time after endgame as well along with Ironman & Captain America. I don't see how he fits in the future of the Universe at all. If you were going to keep him around I would've much rather of seen an entire film with him with the Guardians of the Galaxy & working with James Gunn. Speaking of, no one should direct the Guardians of the Galaxy but James Gunn. The scenes with actors from that film are all off with a different director. All the characters just felt off in this movie and that lives and dies with Taika Waititi. Now I like his films, he is a great filmmaker and funny in general but the tonality of this film is just all over the place and he really isn't a great fit for this anymore.Now the only and I mean only saving grace in this film is Christian Bale hamming it up in spectacular fashion. The film was only ever good when he was on screen. Far and beyond the only interesting character in the entire film and he's honestly barely in it. Just a complete waste of his talent.So from here I have no idea what marvel is doing. Their ""storyline"" is all over the place since Endgame. They better figure it out quick because this was just a mess from beginning to end.","4/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","shrikantnikhil","9 July 2022","A very Broken Story.No character Development.Jokes every two minutes.Most of the Jokes dont land.Bale as Gorr is Fantastic but has very little screen time, his character has a complete different tone than that of the movie (doesn't fit).","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","dannylee-78082","19 July 2022","This is by far the worst movie in phase IV. I even enjoyed Eternals. While not as exciting, I thought it was a fun watch. But this feels hard to defend.Throughout the movie, Christian Bale gives his best effort to salvage the movie with little impact. Even the origin story felt clunky but it did set the light and comical undertone. I initially thought this was not necessarily a negative - just different. However, my mind began to see the truth of it as the movie passed.The entire trailer was like within the first 5 min. I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with that but it added to more anticipation how the rest of the movie was going to play out, which in the end added more disappointment because it did not deliver. It was good to see Natalie Portman on screen again but she wasn't particularly outstanding in this film. If she's not to return in future Thor movies, I don't understand why she needed to reappear as I feel like Jane's character was assassinated to accommodate the overall comical undertone. I simply couldn't comprehend why she would turn from a career-focused physicist to battle loving warrior. It felt so out of character but poorly explained. I initially thought that the hammer was to cure her terminal cancer but turned out that it actually drains its life force. This was some elementary writing that I cannot believe was approved. There was no sense of logic or buildup and the audience was just supposed to swallow the ridiculous propositions that the movie presented. Furthermore, Jane and Thor's relationship was portrayed so poorly. Their kissing had no emotional effect. They broke up because they got distant and 3 years later, they suddenly have a spark again. Elementary writing at best that surely cannot anticipate mature viewers to appreciate. Valkyrie felt like she was also another victim of character assassination. I even noticed this despite her not being the main center of focus in this movie. She has never felt this light.Overall, the technical aspects also felt lacking. Many have already commented on the low quality CG moments of the movie. I have to admit that I didn't point that out in my notes as I was watching the movie but it did definitely feel visually underwhelming, similar to how Black Widow felt. On top of that, the music and the battle sequences felt underwhelming and that's where I figured that this will be terrible because those are Marvel's strong suits. Not hitting those checkboxes indicates a serious problem.Once the veil of comedy was lifted and the movie started to take a more heavy turn, I still could not take it seriously because the execution felt cliche and subpar. For most of the movie, I had not taken the movie seriously because the tone provided zero weight with its cringe jokes that are supposed to make middle schoolers laugh. The inconsistency in its tone made the movie a little short of everything - not comedy, not action, not drama, not romance not a Marvel movie that we've all loved in the end.For some positives, I found the shadow monsters intriguing. I thought they were well designed, albeit nothing entirely new. I found the screaming goats funny, partially because I wasn't aware of the meme before. I appreciated the black and white tone in the shadow realm. Felt like Sin City for a moment. Bale definitely stole the scene in all of his moments but I am not still convinced that this movie was a good choice for his near-perfect filmography.Overall, I found Thor to be a high budget B movie that significantly tainted Phase IV and (hopefully not) will have a lasting impact on future Marvel projects.","4/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","jjakum-96413","8 July 2022","Haven't written a review in a long long time but I felt it was my civic duty to warn people about this dumpster fire. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought I stepped into a spoof movie. I was waiting for Mel Brooks to show up. I don't know how the MCU recovers from this. 1. They turned Thor into a buffoon. 2. The Pacing of the movie was terrible. 3. It tried to be funny and failed miserably. 4. Korg is the Jar Jar of the MCU. Every scene with him is as irritating as poison ivy.I also can not believe Russell Crowe signed up for this. Times must be tough.The mid-credit scene was pointless as well. Nobody cares about Hercules.","3/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","netflixry","10 July 2022","At best Thor: Love and Thunder is a 4.out of 10. I'm a HUGE fan of Taika Waititi, and of the Marvel Universe. Thor: Ragnarock is my favorite Thor movie, and one of my top five favorite MCU movie, but Love and Thunder is just an absolute train wreck. A total swing for the fences, and a miss. Unfortunately it seems they were swinging for fences which most likely border the Three Stooges Universe, and nowhere near the MCU. Is Love and Thunder worth watching? Yeah there's some entertainment there, but don't go expecting a top notch MCU experience. Lower your expectations a lot. Otherwise you're in for a big dissapointment.","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","apereztenessa-1","15 July 2022","Thor Love and Thunder is a massive failure. Like Ragnarok, it doesn't take itself seriously. Unfortunately, in this case, the jokes are just not funny. So while Ragnarok carried its audience along through its humor, Love and Thunder fails to do the same, and the audience is left staring at a not funny film that doesn't believe in itself. Soon enough the characters abandon the screen and the worst risk of all superhero movies materializes: all you see is grown-up people in superhero costumes. It's embarrassing for the actors (aren't you a bit old to be wearing superhero costumes?) and by reflection, for the audience.I find that poor directors can hide their weaknesses for so long, and Takia Waititi is one such director. His most famous films, Jojo Rabbit and Thor Ragnarok were generally weak, but went by, disguised in some humor that worked okay. Without that artifice, the gaps of Waititi as a filmmaker are fully revealed in this new Thor.","4/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","thePopcornExplorer","8 September 2022","The multiverse plotlines and the insane success of Marvel these days, has made their content become empty, shallow and a mere eye candy experience.The best word to describe this movie is soulless; a fast-paced story that doesn't allow for the plot to evolve organically, a goof fest of characters that are simple comedic versions of their own selves, terrible jokes, ridiculous scenes (the kids in the final act...) all of it wrapped in decent CGI to make it easily digestible.Taika Waititi did the hardest thing which was to recover a character with a boring couple of movies and making the third one the best adaptation for the character itself and for its place in the cinematic universe, but this second time around he simply over did it, I felt nothing for this film, it's an empty experience with good imagery.If you stay for the credit scenes you will see how pointless the final part of the film is, and it had the potential to do some sort of redemption but it's again an empty gesture... Also, the reason I don't score this lower, is the fantastic performance by Christian Bale (nothing surprising here) and makes me sad that they wasted such a great villain in a movie like this, a great achievement not from the acting department made possible by Bale and Portman but also for the villain's background story, one of the richest I can recall from the MCU.Wasted potential, Marvel and Disney are sitting on their pile of money making this Phase 4 which has been overall very underwhelming, I know this won't happen, but they should either give audiences a break from Marvel or just reinvent the Universe and explore other characters and directions.","5/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","tpcatoz-90650","8 July 2022","It pains me to write this review because I really wanted to love this movie and I really enjoyed Thor Ragnorak, but this movie just wasn't good.Before going into the movie I was interested in what people were saying about it and saw a ton of people comment on the amount of jokes. They were so right. It felt like there was a joke every 30 seconds. They were barely any serious parts in the movie and in my opinion it really hurt the movie. Marvel usually does an excellent job with balancing the jokes in their movies, but Love N Thunder just over does it completely.Also, why did Endgame make it appear as though the GOTG and Thor were going to be a team for the foreseeable future? The Guardians were basically not in the movie and it was definitely disappointing for me.The pacing also felt kinda odd in my opinion. It felt like it picked up and slowed down and kept repeating this.Overall, I didn't hate this movie but I had high hopes going into it and felt dissatisfied afterwards. The jokes and pacing were big complaints of mine but there was some decent parts to this movie's.","5/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","ryannoel-84353","23 April 2023","Thor: Love and Thunder feels like an absolute disaster of a movie, taking all the positive aspects from Thor: Ragnarok and focusing on mindless humour.The movie is poorly written and lacks any coherent plot. The screenplay is a mess of contrived dialogue, nonsensical character motivations, and lazy storytelling. The movie attempts to be a comedy, but the jokes are forced and unfunny, falling flat at every turn. Even the action scenes, which are supposed to be the movie's saving grace, are poorly choreographed and unexciting.The performances of the cast are wasted in this movie, with even veteran actors like Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman unable to save it. Hemsworth's portrayal of Thor, which was previously a highlight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is reduced to a caricature of itself, with the character reduced to a bumbling, unfunny joke. Portman's Jane Foster, who was previously absent from the MCU, is given nothing to work with, reduced to a love interest and a plot device.The new characters introduced in the movie are poorly developed and forgettable. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, who was previously a promising character, is reduced to a one-dimensional stereotype, and her role in the movie feels tacked on and unnecessary. The villain played by Christian Bale is a paper-thin caricature, lacking any depth or nuance, he is set up as the big bad however is quite underwhelming despise the efforts of Bale.The movie's visual effects are unimpressive and feel like a step back from previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.The CGI is often poorly rendered, and the movie's use of practical effects is uninspired. The film's overall look and feel are underwhelming, lacking the epic scale and scope that fans have come to expect from Marvel movies.In conclusion, Thor: Love and Thunder is a terrible movie that squanders the potential of its talented cast and adds nothing to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie's poor writing, unfunny jokes, forgettable characters, and underwhelming visuals make it a complete waste of time and money. Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be better off skipping this movie altogether and waiting for something better to come along.","5/10"

But Waititi just wants his mark everywhere. From the direction, the narration film screen time. It was just way too much infact piss poor usage.The only saving grace was Christian Bale who could only work with the material he had but worked his cotton socks off, as for Zeus what a lame attempt to use Russell crow in his worst performance as a kebab shop owner and also in a fat suit and honestly embarrassing to put his name to that.Love the marvel franchises but this one is a miss for me.","4/10"

The writing is for kids, the plot is for kids, the ending is about a kid that no one cares since it was gone for the whole movie!My sincere question: When all those executives &producers, major actors and actresses picked up the script, they all said wow that is good writing? Someone must be pulling a lot of strings if he can get funding for a script so badly written.Thor is dumb now btw. The whole movie is a parody of Thor.Thor can give his powers to anyone he likes, so he creates an army of little Thors basically.Also, remember when yielding Stormbreaker was a huge deal? Created by the flames of a dying star-will brake everyone not strong enough to yield it and make him mad?? Yeah...Now everyone can yield it basically. Even a KID!You also have a love triangle between Thor, Mjolnir and Stormrbreaker, which can drink beer now and can be petted....Marvel did it again. One of the worst, super cringe movies ever made.","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","hjalsayegh","17 July 2022","This is a popcorn movie that you're not meant to take seriously, while I'm fine with silliness a lot of it here is in very poor taste.The infinity gauntlet that caused half of humanity to just poof for 5 years? Yeah lets make fun of that tragic event that people are in-world are still recovering from as a one-time gag in an ice cream shop name.Our heroine has stage 4 cancer and dying, because that works so well with none stop silliness and fifth grade level humor. Cancer.... and they keep reminding you of it. Cancer and chemo is supposed to be funny to anyone?Thor is now a parody of himself and all the personal growth he got from the past movies is gone, he is now a clown that happens to have some powers.The screaming goats meme from 10 years ago was funny though. I laughed at that. Also the boat goat vehicle was creative but that's all the credit I can give the movie. All the key moments like Jane realizing her powers, gods dying...etc all of them are off screen, all you get to see is the silly fluff.","2/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","demoustierfrancois","28 October 2022","This movie was just... ridiculous by so many aspects. There are a few, very few great moments, but which are absolutely not enough to save the film from its director, his color frenzy, and all the ridiculous fluff surrounding the story, that generally make the movie fun, enjoyable, more interesting, but in this case seem like repeated and clear attempts to make the audience cringe.The main story in itself had so.freaking.much potential, and they completely wasted it, got completely lost in derision. Seemed like a sarcastic parody of itself... Lame. This one I'm clearly not going to watch again any time soon, if ever...I feel like it needs a 1* just to try and counterbalance the throng of fake votes made on this site to artifically increase the score of that crap.","2/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","rolfthe45","18 May 2023","Thor 4 is bad. Really bad. Like really really bad.I have no clue how Taika Waititi, director of Thor 3 (which is one of the best MCU movies) and Oscar-Winning ""Jojo-Rabbit"", could create such a bad movie.So do not get me wrong, this isn't THE worst movie ever, as a standalone it's just a quite average mediocore superhero movie. But this isnt a standalone movie. This is the forth installement in the thor franchise and features well known and established characters, of whom we all want to know how their story plays out after the defeat of Thanos.And in this context, everything, literally everything is this movie is bad. No not bad, horrible. This is a mess, a movie that feels like a badly written fan fiction.There is only one thing that grants this movie at least 1 out of 10 points: Christian Bale. He always delivers, and it is a shame he was wasted in movie like this.Really there is nothing good to tell about this movie. Even die-hard mcu and thor fans should not watch this abomination of a movie. Rather rewatch any other Marvel movie.","3/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","Cruise2061","8 July 2022","This much anticipated sequel turned out to be a morass of Avenger vs Playschool that fails to be either.Not that the action or FX was poorly done. What was totally off was the storyline.Whatever plot existed was white-anted by alternating weak comedy and melodrama. Swinging repeatedly from serious worlds-at-stake tension to SNL sketches just didn't work and playful, lighthearted cameos by Damon and a rotund Crowe contrasting starkly and awkwardly against dramatic monologues from Bale just added to the WTF factor.Add the innumerable plot holes and the cast must've been as bemused as the audience. Descriptions like drama, action thriller, RomCom and parody can not apply to this plot salad.Morbid curiosity or blind loyalty would be the only things keeping more from walking out on this trainwreck. For me it was mostly the former but I'd tuned out after 15 minutes.In summary, early reviews are correct.Whether it was a whim or a romp for self-amusement, MCU have created a flick to out-Razz DC's WW '84.This is one sequel better not made.","3/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","chera_khalid","26 September 2023","""Thor: Love and Thunder"" hammers its way into theaters with a 6/10 rating, and I must say, it was just okay. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson deliver charismatic performances, injecting humor and heart into their characters. The film editing keeps the pace lively, balancing action with quirky moments. Its strength lies in its exploration of themes like identity and legacy, and the film certainly doesn't shy away from the over-the-top comic book fun. However, it falters with a somewhat convoluted plot and a sense of d√©j√† vu from previous Thor installments. The music adds a bombastic flair, and the cinematography captures the fantastical landscapes with vividness. ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" may not be the most thunderous entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it delivers a decent dose of cosmic superhero antics for those seeking a fun, if somewhat familiar, adventure.","2/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","heidibokor","24 September 2022","Worst Marvel movie to date! It's ridiculous and lame. The constant jokes are very cringe worthy. The acting is by far the worst as well. And let's not get started on the CGI!!! Way overused and looks terrible! People complained about The Eternals movie being the worst, but it's spectacular compared to this drivel. Actually, The Eternals should set the bar for cinematography and great story telling. The Thor movies need to stop! And they definitely need to find a different director if they plan to make more movies. We need more movies like Logan and less movies like this. Terrible, terrible!!!!!","1/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","D4V1D2411","12 July 2022","I dont know what happened to the movie, it was at all times, a disappointment. The story of gorr is one of hte most interesting in the comics and here, he barely appears, he has 3 scenes of dialogue, a fight scene, the final fight scene and its over, hes dead. Valkyrie and Korg are annoying for me, the do nothing all the movie but to tell stupid jokes and to be gay. Thor while being funny in other movies like Ragarok or Endgame, you felt he still had its serious moments or realization, of growth, etc; but not in this movie, he is pure stupid, all the time he is just thinking in what his next joke is going to be, Jane foster also has the same problems, a character that was serious in previous movies and now is going throught a very serious stage in her life due to cancer, is also only thinking in the next joke to say. Fortunately, shes still the best part of the movie because to a certain extent, she is a little bit more serious and has her moments. But all the movie feels like that, a joke, and the worst part is that they dont make you laugh either, they sometimes tell the same joke over and over until you just cant stand it anymore or is the most stupid joke youve ever heard. On the good things, you could say that the fight scenes are really cool, not on the level as ragnarok, but still OK, the soundtrack is also cool but it has the problem that almost none is implemented correctly, and also the colors and normally the stethic of the movie is cool, with very bright colors and good designs.But thats it, theres nothing more to say I think, the entire movie is just a bad joke that apports nothing and doesnt make you laugh.","6/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","Jeremy_Urquhart","9 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder may not technically be the worst movie in the MCU, but it's probably the most disappointing. For that alone, I would say that it's probably my least favourite movie from the MCU so far.Taika Waititi brought a lot to Thor: Ragnarok, and it was an MCU movie I really enjoyed, and it took the character of Thor in an interesting, fun direction. Love and Thunder seems like it's trying to capture the same sense of comedy, action, and absurd fantasy, but the execution is off. The cast are all doing the best they can with what they're given, but the writers, director, editors, and all the people behind the scenes seem like they're on autopilot at best, and genuinely uninterested with the whole thing at worst.There were a couple of okay scenes, but even the okay scenes could have been better. For example, there's a good set-up for the villain, only to have that character ultimately wasted. Same for the Zeus + other gods scenes- it's a bit of fun, but it doesn't add up to much.I smiled a few times but there were no big laughs, and a shocking number of jokes fell flat. Sure, the idea of giant screaming goats is a funny one, for example... but the joke doesn't go anywhere, they're not built on, and there's no pay-off. They're just big and loud and that's it. Also... way to waste The Guardians of the Galaxy. They're there at the start, but don't even feel like the real characters; sort of like bootleg, knockoff Guardians. It almost felt like the entire cast of Guardians were being held hostage on the set of Thor 4.Elsewhere, the action scenes are so boring, and this is a big problem with the MCU at the moment. I feel like the only Marvel movie of the past two years that's had genuinely exciting, memorable action was Shang-Chi, and the action scenes here are particularly lacklustre.Also... three times an important character seems to die, only for them to be revealed to be fine. You can do this once per movie at most (even that can be pushing it), but multiple times? No one likes fake-out deaths! And Loki just had his own Disney+ show and was a big part of the first three Thor's... why couldn't he make some sort of appearance? He's just somewhere else in the ever-expanding MCU while Thor 4 is going on- the universe is getting dangerously big at this point.I didn't hate everything while watching it, but I forgot about 95% of this movie right after exiting the cinema. If there's a more disappointing release in 2022 for me personally than this, I'll be shocked.","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","alashiq-95615","7 September 2022","I don't know, I'm disappointed, mixed feelings.. does anyone know if Disney has bought Marvel? I know that marvel is a subsidiary of Disney but Marvel has always had its own style up until now anyway... you notice that disney has started to decide more in the marvel movies.. for example Korg when he tell a story about his two fathers who managed to give birth to a stone (which nonsense, sigh).. This Thor movie felt more like an old Disney movie i saw when i were 9 years old (23 years ago). At this time i was tagged and liked the cool budget effects without noticing how poorly made they were. That's how it was in this Thor movie now 23 years later. There was no context and no serious mission either, I think this was one of the cheapest movies Marvel made and it's made for kids?. The movie felt like a parody of a real Thor movie but the bad thing is that Chris Hemsworth is parodying himself? I must say, however, that the film had a very few serious and good moments that are worth mentioning (NOT).. the whole movie warth a 2a nothing more.","4/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","MrHomerJay","10 July 2022","Director - Taika Waititi: ""In the moment, you're like, ""This is the greatest thing that anyone's ever filmed in the history of filming things."" And you get into the edit. You're like, ""I still kind of like it."" And then, after about six months of it being in the movie, you realize it was fun on the day but it doesn't have any business being in the movie""Thor - Chris Hemsworth: ""It was Taika at his craziest. Taika, normally, is kind of at an 11, so you can do the math there. He described it as like he'd been given the keys to the kingdom, and someone said, 'Here, if a seven-year-old was making a movie, what would you do?' He said, 'Well, I want to put this in it. I want to do this. I want to try this.' And everything he suggested, I said yes to, and then we had this insane film in front of us.""Story - the core plot of the movie is actually good and has a lot of potential. However the scenes advancing the plot are few and far between, edited to be as short as possible feeling rushed. Each plot scene is then undercut with a comedy scene that immediately follows. Serious plot points aren't given room to breathe the way they were in Ragnarok. This movie plays like a clown dancing at a funeral.The worst issue is that the comedy doesn't work like it did in Ragnorok. Taika Waititi appears to be a one trick pony like M. Night Shyamalan. He doesn't evolve, he just gives you more of the same. All of the comedy is basically ""look at this random thing"" e.g. The goats bleat dozens of times for a supposed laugh. Just like Shyamalan, Waititi inserted himself into this movie. His character Korg unlike in Ragnorok is now one of the main characters present throughout the plot.Performances - The performances were good. Chris Hemsworth literally embodies Thor, Christian Bale is amazing and plays a complex and sympathetic character (too good for this movie). The rest of the cast does a good job as well.Visuals - Overall the best way I can describe them is a supersaturated rainbow splashed all over the screen. Visuals however are poorly done. The movie uses new tech that projects the background behind the actors. Problem is that in all the close up shots, it looks exactly for what it is. Actors appear in the foreground superimposed on the environment. Try watching the trailer in slow motion, you'll see it. Overall it's underwhelming for a modern movie and disappointing for an MCU oneOverall - This movie commits the worst crime of all: it was boring. You can't invest yourself into the story as it's constantly uncut by jokes and you can't enjoy a comedy since the jokes don't land, seemingly targeted at very young audience.Unfortunately I have to give this 1/10 judging by the MCU standards.","6/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","VisionThing","16 July 2022","I loved Thor: Ragnarok. I thought the humour in it did a great job counterbalancing the really dark subject matter (destruction of Asgard); the humour enhanced the film. I went to see Thor: Love and Thunder giddy with high expectations, but was immensely disappointed.The quality of writing in LaT in comparison to its predecessor is like particularly sordid fan fiction by someone who completely misinterpreted what made Ragnarok so great. (It's worth noting that Taika Waikiki did not write Ragnarok, only directed it. And none of the screenwriters from Ragnarok were involved in the making of this film.)There is no real plot. Dialogues are horrid, chock-full of very forced out-of-place elementary school level ""humour"". Directing, editing, and even a lot of the CGI feel like rushjobs. Most acting is bad. The only one who seemed to put real effort into this was Christian Bale, who unfortunately has very little screen time.To sum it up, Love and Thunder is an astonishingly bad movie. It is nothing but a cavalcade of bad jokes, pointless meandering, glaring plot holes, and degradation of the character that was Thor.","1/10"

Yes. Its worse than the dark world.I dont know what happened, everything was too short, massive decisions made no sense at all, there was an absolute hampering of the quality of this film to make it the shortest mcu film to date.I love taika waititi, i loved his vision for thor in 2017, but for me this was a total bust and it was unbelievably disappointing.

The concept of Gods and Asgard have been made to look like Disneyland.Overall, avoid watching this if you can. It's just a waste of time.Also this requirement of 600 characters is stupid.

What a loser.Then boredom happens, the screaming goats are funny for 2 minutes but it drags on for ages and is so repetitive the gag gets really old really fast.It has no time to breathe, the themes are love and loss and death and terminal cancer and inevitable loss, but there is a cheap gag every 30 seconds so we're not supposed to care at all about any of that.This is a film which seems to be aimed at, and written by, a 7 year old with ADHD.","3/10"

Bodies were being blasted apart and thrown all over. Maybe at least a broken bone or two. Yet when reunited with their families not a scratch.Finally what's the deal with Russell Crowe's Zeus?

"Thor: Love and Thunder","MattyLuke-81663","21 November 2023","It is never a good sign when I am rooting for the main villain to kill all the heroes.It is also not a good sign that freaking Deadpool did a better cancer story than this.One of the most irritating movies I have seen in a while. Annoying in terms of how every character (except Gorr) is a comedian and annoying how much potential is wasted.The movie felt like Saturday Night Live sketch stretched out to two hours.The movie could have been a dark finale to the character of Thor. I mean, this is the same god who lost his mother, father, brother three times, his home, and lived with guilt for five years after failing to kill Thanos the first time. If that wasn't bad enough, his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster is dying from cancer, and on top of that, there is a new villain who seeks to kill gods. Again, this could have been a dark finale, as he is the most tragic character in the MCU, but here he's just a goofy idiot. Chris Hemsworth has comedic chops, but they did this character dirty. They turned Thor from ""Thor making jokes"" to ""Thor is the joke"".Christian Bale always delivers, and he was creepy and campy as Gorr the God Butcher. His storyline is the only serious part of the movie that unfortunately gets undeveloped with very little screen time. His character work was rushed because at the start he worth ships the gods, but as quick as a light switch, he wants to kill every god possible. Since he is called The God Butcher, you don't see a lot of God killing. The ones he does kill in the movie were an afterthought.Natalie Portman was good, but sadly the dramatic elements of her character didn't pull on my heartstrings. On the other hand, there are some cool action scenes with her, even though it's strange how fully experienced she is in fighting with these powers despite how recent she got it.The whole movie is one big joke, with no clear focus on what storyline it wants to go. The short runtime does not help either, as it needed more breathing room for development like character work and story.I could talk about the visual effects, but I will not since the visual effect artists have been through enough already. Seriously Marvel, treat your employees with respect.The Guardians of the Galaxy team are there with no purpose than to help Thor lose weight, and then they leave.Director Taika Waititi went way over his head with this one. One of the most unusual inclusions of these screaming goats in the movie for no reason and there keep repeating the joke of them screaming. Like, WHY????Is it me, or do the recent Marvel movies feel like quantity over quality? There are like a factory machine, pumping out many movies and an endless line of TV shows. The runtime clocked in under two hours, with this movie and Doctor Strange 2, and yet I felt those movies needed more time to breathe and flesh out the characters because everything feels so rushed and, in a hurry, to end.Balancing comedy and drama are a difficult task to get right. If a movie has a serious tone while not being a good movie itself, there is a potential for it to be funny and enjoyable.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","kosmasp","10 July 2022","Round two ... my internet really pulled one on me. I had the complete review written and then it ... well it went away. So from the start - and probably a bit different than the other review I wrote. A bit like the Thor you get here. Taika reinvented him for Ragnarok - and he even went further with this installment.You have to dig what he does - and his humor too of course. I understand that some do not like the humor. You can't fault the movie technically speaking though. Ask (your) kids - maybe you got a bit weary, but they surely haven't. And the darkness that Christian Bale brings to his role (great as always of course), will not faze them either.Bale who gets introduced first in the movie. Might be a (new) trend for Marvel. Giving us the bad guy, before we see the good guy(s). Moon Knight did the same (Ms. Marvel did not of course), but let's keep an eye out for that.Bales character is not alone when he gets introduced. There is someone with him. And while you may want to forget about it. Bale will not let you. He will keep talking about that character - so much so, that you may get a bit annoyed. But there is a reason (or two, no pun intended) for that.Everyone except Bale can show off their silly side. Adding a bit of gravitas from time to time. But the darker tone and mood is kept for Bale and his character. He may not have much screentime, but the movie called Thor (whoever that might be - you probably have seen the trailer so you have an idea I reckon).But apart from reintroducing characters to us, the movie is also reintroducing the Thor (movie) mythology to us. So if you or the little one you are with or whoever have not seen the previous movies, you get a ""what happened"" at the beginning. Not everything will be rehashed. There is another flashback kept for later in the movie.This is the fourth Thor movie and aside of Hugf Jackman as Wolverine, no one has played a comic book character as long as Chris Hemsworth has. And the latter has gone through quite the transformations. I understand if you are not into the humor.I myself had an issue with another character (that you may already know is in the movie). The portrayal and the accent seemed weird to say the least. But even though I had my own preconceptions about that ... I'll call it character, I understand that Taika only wanted to do his thing. I did not know he was part of the Marvel comic book cannon to be honest, but I am not as involved in the comics as others are.So while there is not much story here (getting from point a to b and all that), there are a lot of cool set pieces. And a lot of weird (Taika) humor. Like him expanding the God universe if you want to call it that. Which is sort of the scene I was talking about above.It all makes sense in the end though and for me the balance between silly and drama did work. You have to suspend your disbelief, maybe drink a little bit of that kool aid and just go with the flow.I for my part am happy Thor is back. At the end of Avengers Endgame, no one seemed to know (apart from Kevin Feige probably), if any of the surviving (and available, no pun intended to the ""old"" man, who passed on ... well you know what) characters would return. So seeing Thor get into the Guardians of the Galaxy ship really made me hope he'd return. I thought it would be in a Guardians movie, but it's them who were in this ... at least for a little bit. A funny little bit that is.And then you have the end credits scenes. People should be aware of them, but still some get up and leave. As with most MCU movies (minus Endgame), you get some bonus and look into the future. One scene during the credits and one after ... both are promising and really great to say the least.So sit back, relax and let the (mostly) lightness wash over you ... it would be a shame if you couldn't. I just had to laugh, because there is a moment where Thor is naked. You don't see a front shot of that, but you do get to see his behind ... uncensored, if that means anything to you. It's another joke and it does work quite well too (no pun intended).Edit: almost completely forgot a few important things. One thing I am surprised by. Well the non reaction from people who are into religion (no matter what kind) that is. Because the movie essentially is critisizing almost everything about religion. It does make fun of Gods ... no pun intended. This is more than the silly depiction of Thor. This is kind of an atheist ... well heaven (another pun I know). It is underlying, but it is not subtle to be honest.And of course the music - Guns N Roses for the win as some might say. Music apparently played a big role during the making of the movie. And if you don't mind classic rock as I reckon people would call it now ... well you could do a lot worse.","3/10"

Despite being trapped in a wildly generic villain arc, he does wonders with what he's given!Natalie Portman too is a good bit of fun, perhaps for once enjoying herself in these movies.Within her newly dubbed role as Mighty Thor she conjures up more than a few surprises to justify her character's radical turn.But this is Hemsworth's show and he's a man who loooves any spotlight where he can be as absurd and against hero-type as humanly possible.Taika Waititi, no slouch either in the out-of-his-mind department, aids his leading man's every whim and throws curve balls left and right (to Hemsworth and the MCU in general).Yet, despite the two's almost transparent attempt to push things beyond the scope of reason or...taste, Thor still comes out the other side with hero statues firmly in check.And you can bet that's no accident.","3/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","sackofwhine","6 July 2022","The same old story with these MCU movies. I hate basically everything they represent and the main producer behind these films, Kevin Feige, is the literal demon that ruined cinema as we know it. He represents everything wrong with the film industry.This film is the same old garbage repackaged with some new fun ideas. For starters, yes I laughed quite a bit during many moments. You can definitely enjoy this film purely from a SNL skit perspective. Also some of the ideas Waititi plays around are fun and enjoyable, such as the 80s inspired rock-costumes and the designs of many aliens. The score and soundtrack are really well implemented.However aesthetically this film is one of the worst offenders. Rarely have I seen this much bad CGI in such a big film. The action ranges from ok to atrocious. The shot language is extremely bad and stale, not a single ounce of dynamic and movement. Just basic green screen single shots and reverse shots. Where's the ingenuity of ""Hunt of the Wilderpeople?"", it all looks so fake and textureless. Gave me Robert Rodriguez mid 2000s green-screen movie vibes, but without the charm.Every scene taking place on earth in an interior set is one of the most bafflingly looking things I've ever seen.","1/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","NormalGuyReviews","12 September 2022","I'm really not sure what they were trying to do here... it's a funny movie but I don't think it was supposed to be. If you took out Christian Bale's performance ""Love and Thunder"" is more akin to SpaceBalls than any Marvel movie. The ""comic relief"" feels painfully forced and it gets old quick. There was a lot of potential here for a fun Thor movie but it came across as more silly than anything else. The plot was there but the script seemed like it was written by a 14 year old who likes fart jokes. It could have been worse but it also could have been a lot better. Overall disappointed hopefully Marvel can recover from this one.","9/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","jmcd2007","25 July 2022","Phase 4 has had a mediocre run and ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" does not help with this bum streak. This film was hot garbage and felt like a parody of the Thor series while checking all the politically correct boxes in the process. For starters, there was not a lot of action and the humor was forced and really not all that funny. Secondly, nobody asked for Thor to be humanized. There is a scene where he is wearing an apron and flipping pancakes with his daughter at home. It's that bad.Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) enters the picture, is suddenly dealing with a terminal cancer diagnosis and becomes ""The Mighty Thor"" (complete with powers) to the delight of feminists everywhere.. Russell Crowe's Zeus was a waste of airtime and the villian wasn't really all that intimidating.If Marvel wants to have another good film under their catalog, then they should find a way out of their contract from Disney because they (Disney) are destroying what once was a great franchise along with pretty much everything else these days. With that said, Bob Chapek can add another failure to his expanding list of movie flops this year. Love and Thunder misses the mark and isn't simply worth the time and money spent.","1/10"

It's as if they created a movie they new would attract kids and then filled it full of inappropriate sexual content... groomers. Also, the hypocrisy was glaring - we see women ogling Chris Hemsworth's nude body when placing Natalie Portman in the same situation would have been called misogynistic . How about you leave it out all together, there was no need for it. The shame is there was a heart of a good story here with Jane and Thor, too bad it was ruined with Disney's anti-family/pro decadence agenda.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","mariellaaacati","6 July 2022","This is the best Thor film so far. If you enjoyed Ragnarok you will love this one as well.I really appreciate the humor in this movie, which is so familiar from ragnarok, as well as the serious tone in certain scenes. Love & Thunder managed to not only give us fun and action again, but also very emotional character-driven stories. This film seemed like a journey the characters just had to go through and everything just seemed so right.The acting in this movie is exactly as amazing as you would expect it to be with such an amazing and talented cast. My personal favourite performance was Christian Bale as Gorr, who is undoubtably one of the best mcu villains so far. Not only did he seem perfectly reasonable at all times, but he was also scary and intimidating.The cinematography is beautiful and sometimes even unlike anything I had ever seen before.Taika Waititi once again made Thor magical and proved us just how beautiful his way of storytelling is.All in all, this movie is so much fun and emotional and the closest to perfection a thor movie has ever been.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","williegannon","11 July 2022","I think everyone would agree that Thor: Ragnarok was the best Thor film by a good distance and one of the best Marvel movies.Thor: Love and Thunder is a very, very poor follow up. The Avengers: End Game restrictions on the narrative of Ragnarok have been removed and it seems that Taika Waititi has been given full creativity for this shambolic follow up.Awful humor and poorly placed jokes litter the film. Shoddy set pieces, terrible CGI and a really bad story ruin this follow up. More so when you compare it to the last Thor film.The film is filled with forced McGuffins from the first minute as the A to B story is forced from point to point. There is no jeopardy in the film whatsoever.Considering that the Gorr the God Butcher run and the Jane Foster run are considered seminal in comicdom, this film has done more damage to Thor on and off screen than if it hadn't been made at all.Actually, the best thing about the film is the soundtrack. And they didn't even get that right with a handful of Guns and Roses songs and not even a mention of Lady Lightning by Bang Camaro. Probably because its on the Peacemaker soundtrack.Actually, go watch that instead.","3/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","justriffy","11 July 2022","I love Marvel and Thor is one of my favourite characters! I enjoyed watching Love and Thunder but as I was watching this I could see problems with the film! If this was a DC's attempt at a film, I would have accepted this but Marvel have done so well with the previous phases that you think this phase would be amazing!As the film started with Gorr (Christian Bale), I should have felt his pain but because the script was bad it felt rushed, the scene was a disappointment,
Then comes in Thor, who seems to not care and just isn't with it. Instead of building his character, so that he cares, they throw him into a rushed situation! They could have maybe changed this and he meets Jane Foster on her death bed and when he loses her to cancer that probably would have been a strong reason for him to find his way back to being the hero he is. The whole film felt rushed and felt more like an episode. I didn't mind the comedy aspect to it but did feel like they did try hard on this aspect, when the writers should have spent more time on the storyline. Gorr felt more like a subplot and was underused, Jane and Thors love story was more the main plot which should have been more of a TV series.Gorr was meant to be this villain that everyone is scared off but never really felt it as Jane who has never really fought before is taking him on whereas a god that has more experience in combat lost her arm to him,Christian Bale and Russell Crowe were amazing! Chris Hemsworth as usual is Thor! Just hope the next film doesn't have this writer and director as this film was not what I was expecting!","3/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","tmccray","9 July 2022","I was really looking forward to this movie because I loved Ragnarok. This was a mess. The video quality was lacking.

How did the LED panels look so convincing in the Mandalorian and so fake in this? I felt like I was watching a role playing video game.Bale is a great actor, but wasted in this part. His character was not menacing at all. He just shows up in a mass fight and starts sword fighting? What?The Thor and Jane relationship retrospective was painful to watch. It was just plain dumb and juvenile. There was no hint of a real connection to be rooting for.This wasn't a standup routine, but it felt like it. How about a few great, well-placed jokes instead of throwing everything at the wall and see what sticks.I confess I didn't see the end, because I fell asleep!

I wasted time watching it. The MCU unfortunately doesn't feel the same anymore. The original comic book story is a dramatic piece. It feels like they replaced the drama with weak comedy to set it as the base for the movie,
then tried to garnish it with drama. I would've preferred it the other way around. There was way too many jokes in this movie and I just don't even see the reason to even have Korg in this movie. He was just there making joke after joke. The ending fight acne when Thor gave all those kids the power of Thor and the kid with the stuffed rabbit having lightning shooting out of its eyes. I was just annoyed of this movie for me it's like a 4 out of 10. Recently I have felt that I am experiencing what everybody calls superhero fatigue. The last two movies, doctor strange and Thor were moderate at best. I did not enjoy myself as much. The movies seem adequate at best, the characters felt cartoonish, the story was not engaging and I found myself yawning quite a lot. Especially Thor was really disappointing. After the widely popular and fun Ragnarok, this venture was surprising in the sense that the same cast and same director could produce such a joke of a movie. I did laugh in the movie but that was a pity laugh and I was laughing at how bad a movie could be. Many believe that it was not as bad. I myself felt that I wasted my money. I did not enjoy the movie. The superhero movies are not the same. I find myself falling out of love with these kinds of movies. I think I do not have the heart of a 10-year-old anymore. I have grown I guess. I love the mature content. I love something that I could relate to. For instance, I love the boys. I love the Zack Snyder iteration of superhero movies. They have a heavy tone and contain mature content that I can resonate with. The fart jokes are not funny anymore. The audience has grown along with the movies. After such heavy movies like endgame and infinity war, going back to silly things are idiotic on the part of Marvel. Finding a balance between what you cater to the mature audience all the while keeping the children interested is the trick and Marvel should learn better to walk that fine line. But as things stand they are leaning over to the side of making small children happy. Thus, the reason for people's low rating of recent movies. Superhero fatigue is real and has caught up to me. I don't think I will see any of the Marvel movies unless they promise something new and mature.","1/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","Benedict02","12 July 2022","Without even touching on plot holes and things that generally make no sense in this movie for the wider MCU, there is about thirty minutes of footage that belongs to what could have been a serious dark movie - to nobody's surprise all of these scenes include Christian Bale.This could have been a film about a man who loses his daughter and subsequently his faith in his God who becomes corrupted by a sword which was created by Knull, God of the Symbiotes (not that the movie feels the need to tell you any of this). As a result this man makes it his mission to rid the universe of all its Gods. And while on his journey this man turned God Butcher comes across a terminally ill woman who fell in love with one of the deities that our antagonist has made it his mission to kill.Now that's what we could have had... but what we got, is a movie so forgettable in it's plot that i barely remembered the Guardians of the Galaxy were in this when the credits roll, but the comedy in this movie is actively damaging in its attempt to be a carbon copy of Ragnarok. I liked Ragnarok, but I wasn't left wanting another one. This movie could have been so much more than a boring comedy over saturated with lame gags and over-used unfunny jokes; it absolutely wastes Oscar winning actors and actresses in its pursuit to be funny, that's it's just sad to watch because it sacrifices its story and all I end up thinking about is what it could have been.Despite the fact that Gorr the God Butcher is only seen KILLING ONE GOD!!! Christian Bale's performance is by far the highlight of the movie and it's a shame that he didn't have more screen time and his motives and transformation weren't more fully fleshed out. And I can't help but feel that had this movie been come a phase or two before now, and had someone other than Waititi working on the script, it would have been a much better movie. Instead it's just another factory produced piece of garbage churned out by the Marvel machine, but due to the inclusion of Bale and everything involving him it makes this movie disappointing more than anything.","6/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","TheVictoriousV","7 July 2022","A lot of people expected the fourth and supposedly final Thor movie to be a passing of the hammer, and I don't blame them for detecting a pattern within the latest Marvel Universe titles -- at least the ones that concern the original Avengers:So far, Steve Rogers has handed his shield over to Sam ""The Falcon"" Wilson, we've seen a new Black Widow in the form of Yelena, and I'm pretty sure we got a new, younger Hawkeye in the Hawkeye TV show (I'm not gonna watch that), which is to say nothing of She-Hulk. And yes, the trailers for Taika Waititi's Thor: Love and Thunder made it seem as if Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth), who now seems kind of a joke, was going to surrender Mj√∂lnir to Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), his bland love interest from the first two movies. Why her? Because it was in the comics, shush.Hell, pretty much all of these changes mirror the comic books. Passing a superhero mantle from one character to the next -- sometimes of a different race or gender -- is one of the medium's oldest traditions, so I could certainly see why people expected us to get a ""new"" Thor with this film (because apparently, first names are now mantles to be passed forth once a magical hammer abruptly repairs itself).However, after the latest Doctor Strange movie ventured into the Multiverse and changed very little in the process (despite adding such supposed game-changers as America Chavez and other stuff that likely won't be mentioned outside of the Doctor Strange or Scarlet Witch properties), I was genuinely thinking that the trailers were showing us an alternate reality; one that will only feature in this flick as a throwaway adventure and then never be acknowledged again. I won't reveal whether Mighty Thor is a permanent mainstay, but will report that I'm nevertheless troubled by the general directionlessness of Phase Four. What's this all for? What's the next Endgame? And why is the plot point ""Jane was snapped by Thanos and, due to a side effect of it, she now has cancer"" not an Onion headline?As the film begins, Thor is out adventuring with the Guardians of the Galaxy but is forced to reunite with Foster, Korg (Waititi's character from Ragnarok), and other older friends when Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale, who gets the best scenes of the film) starts exacting revenge on all ""gods"". That is, of course, the aliens that inspired the gods and goddesses of Earth mythologies (now including the likes of Zeus, as portrayed by Russell Crowe, who has the power to flick away Original Thor's robes and give us a good look at that regained ""god bod"" of his). He's not going around slaughtering deities willy-nilly.But in terms of more truly god-like (omnipotent) figures, the film also follows in the footsteps of Eternals by bringing in some more of Marvel Comics' more ""cosmic"" characters, specifically Eternity, who is a personification of the entire Universe and the source of Gorr's power -- so there's a decent explanation for why he would become something so impressive as a ""god"" butcher. Whether Eternity is still at the mercy of the Time Variance Authority or an angry witch who can ""destroy the Multiverse"" is anyone's guess. Could Konshu and Moon Knight rearrange the stars that comprise him at their own leisure? Who knows? It's useless to think too hard about Phase Four media.We also reunite with Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), who is the ""king"" of New Asgard while Thor is off with the Guardians. Much fuss has been made about the fact that the film calls a female ruler a king, to which more smart-alecky viewers will explain that Asgard is a made-up fantasy world and so it's not our place to question how the word ""king"" is used in their pretend space-Viking culture. Funny that ""king"" is apparently the only Anglic linguistic unit that's used differently whereas the rest of their language mirrors ours pretty straightforwardly, but whatever. Go off, kween. I mean, qing!Another notable ""character"", I guess, is Mj√∂lnir itself -- which, like I said, makes a very sudden return and seems more interested in Jane than Thor. Its relationship with Thor supplies many supposed laughs. Is it an old ex? Old roommate? Estranged kid? Pet? Simple: It's whatever joke Waititi felt for at the time.Thor: Love and Thunder is very much another Marvel movie. Like many of the post-Phase Three additions, however, it does mostly allow the director to keep his voice. Waititi isn't as unrestrained as Rami was with Multiverse of Madness -- which strayed a little too far from the MCU mold for some fanboys -- but he's possibly even wackier here than with Ragnarok, and we're treated to some wild, interesting-looking worlds (particularly the nightmarish pocket realm of Gorr).The film has enough zaniness to go around and I do like Bale's ""Come to Daddy""-inspired performance, but the VFX will often look incomplete, the dreaded Marvel comedy is worse than ever (capping many nice scenes with a cheeky wisecrack or silly character moment and so deflating them -- when it doesn't outright take older dramatic moments and treat them with all the dignity of a Seltzerberg parody), and some scenes are shot like some McDonald's tie-in commercial that managed to get the actors from the real movie involved. Much like fast food, however, you're not wrong for liking it; I'm not here to stop you. Having just seen the Tollywood epic RRR (which was both crazier and yet treated its characters with more dignity than this), my own patience with Hollywood is the lowest it's ever been, though I guess there's little to be done (even as the spread of RRR does re-ignite my faith).I just hope that you're watching this because you feel it genuinely enriches your incomprehensibly short time on this cosmic spec we so briefly inhabit -- the fact of which bolsters just how astronomically lucky you are to be alive to experience this age of art -- and not because you're too lazy and complacent to seek out whatever isn't Hollywood-approved product. And yes, that includes if you're watching it just for Buff Mommy Portman; I'm all for that.","7/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","humzahladiwala","8 July 2022","I'm going to make this one short, because the movie just came out and i don't want to risk spoilers.Right off the bat, this new Thor movie is really poor. It's not so much bad as it is just mindless. There's no intention, no direction, the movie feels as lost as it's title character who still has a lot of growth to do after his bro phase in Endgame. The film's plot is so bizarre and shallow that it's immensely talented cast is wasted. The jokes are so inconsistent that I can't believe Taika Watiti, a future comedic legend actually wrote this movie. In my opinion, Christian Bale was spectacularly let down. I was very excited for his character, because I really enjoy his work and in my opinion, he is one of the most talented actors working today. What we got was unbefitting for someone of his range and caliber. Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is as bad as Captain Marvel for me, but for the exact opposite reasons. The movie has way, WAY too much personality and ambitions, and it falls short of being memorable or coming remotely close to its ambitions. Instead, the movie comes off as more shallow then a baby pool and fails to justify its existence. Anyway, that's my attempt at a spoiler free review, I hope other MCU fans enjoy this one more than me (although that's looking doubtful).","2/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","VinsendVega","10 July 2022","Although I realy enjoyed Taika Waititi idiosyncratic style in Jojo Rabbit, It doesn't work for a movie like Thor. Previous Thor movies where never too serious and already had plenty of humor. Making a parody of a character like this just feels fake and turned the whole movie into a somewhat childish joke. The relationship between Thor and jane is very different from previous movies and I should probably tell you the director has taken a lot of artistic liberties with their back story. Thor is turned into a goofy Homer Simpson-type of loveable Idiot and the entire first half of the movie feels very empty. Some parts do get a good laugh but for me the whole movie was far too silly and childish.Positives: Christian bale makes great villain and the visuals are great (even by marvel standards).Not for serious fans. Woman and children seem to be the target audience here.","3/10"

"Thor: Love and Thunder","jhalcollege","10 July 2022","A brief list of problems with this movie
1. It's a movie by committee, which means it exists for the sole purpose of making money. They have to check certain boxes, make sure everyone is happy, and not offend anyone.2. It takes itself pretty seriously until they decide to throw in a joke, which is about every 90 seconds
3. Christian Bale is a great actor (from Empire of the Sun to American Psycho), so let's give him almost nothing to work with, aside from (yet another) ""I want to destroy everything"" bad guy
4. Everyone loves Guns n Roses, so we should play four of their songs! But not any of the deep cuts, just the hits at cliched parts of the movie (and even name a character Axl)
5. Russel Crowe: It doesn't matter that his Greek accent sounds more Italian than anything else, people like him so maybe they'll like this movie.6. Screaming goats.","2/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","ScoobySnacks66","24 July 2022","While a touch of Taika's farcical ""What We Do In The Shadows"" humour was splendid in Ragnorak, there's too much of it in this film. It's a non-stop corn-ball comedy hour full of jokes that could have been funny if I wasn't annoyed that they just didn't stop. All the corniness made it really hard for me to get invested in the characters. I just didn't care what happened to anyone in the film, I looked at my watch at least three times and was happy when it was over. Also, stop shoving the WOKE nonsense down our throats. It's so bloody annoying now. Thor was the best, most powerful and most thrilling marvel character and now he's the butt end of a joke, looking stupid so that everyone around him looks much smarter.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","roaches_97","8 July 2022","Yeah I said it, this film is worse than Dark World. It's painfully unfunny, the visuals are over saturated, and the plot is dumb. If Gorr's plan is to kill all the gods by wishing them out of existence, then why did he make himself known to them instead of staying under the radar and sneaking in to the magical bs wishing well? Why didn't Thor use his lightning powers that he had in Ragnarok to fight Gorr instead of risking losing his axe? There are tons of inconsistencies like this throughout the film. The performances are generally okay. Hemsworth does well as Thor, Natalie Portman is alright as Jane Foster, Tessa Thompson gives a terrible performance, and Christian Bale is the highlight of the movie. The movie just feels empty overall. It means nothing, there is no emotional payoff to any of it. And the sad thing is, this is one of the better post-Endgame Marvel movies.","2/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","jamesrupert2014","11 March 2023","Someone with a sword that can kill Gods goes on a vengeance binge to the navel of the Universe to destroy all the gods in one fell swoop - or something to that effect - unless the increasingly clownish heroes of the MCU can stop him. The film is one long series of extravagant images, childish jokes, and goofy sight-gags, to the point of almost being a witless parody of the worst excesses of the genre. The CGI is technically impressive but artistically unimaginative (an exception being the B/W sequence), the story is dull and derivative, the A-list cast is stuck delivering a D-list script that would have been at home in a 1970's Saturday morning cartoon, the climatic fight is cretinous (but not unexpected from a production company that once gave the world the Mickey Mouse Club) and the maudlin ending risible. I forced myself to finish the film (mostly watching with one eye and 1/10 of my brain (which was still more than needed)). The film is not just awful, its annoyingly and irritatingly awful but, sadly, it still made money, so I'll save a 1/10 score for the inevitable next installment.","4/10"
"Thor: Love and Thunder","malice_o_conner","8 July 2022","This is yet another installment of the drivel from Hollywood/Marvel. While it had more Thor than Strange was part of his 2nd movie - this was not coherent, in fact rather it was whimsical, directionless, and complete waste. I can only give credit to Bale's performance as he seemed to be the only one who was trying. Everyone else was a hollow representation, a shell of the character. Too bad Bale was coming from another film to put the 100% to this - although it wouldn't have saved this trash.Every attempt to be funny was a miss to me. Everything that was meant to have meaning was meaningless. Everything that was supposed to have a reason, either didn't or was explained in the dumbest way possible. This is just another installment of Propaganda Marvel films, and the complete ideocracy that has become Hollywood today. They do not care, everything is a tool to spread the messages that want. Nothing is sacred, nothing is nuanced, or complex. When it should be complex, it's pathetically simple. Like if you wanted to break into CIA HQ in Langly, it's not a problem because what you need will fall in your lap, and all the guards are completely inept. Oh and like an Epstein - the cameras will magically ""not work"". They think you are this dumb that you should be eating this puke pile up and be saying, ""thank you, may I have another?""
The film has so much to go over but not without spoilers so I simply say miss this one. Miss it entirely. Don't bother with it even in streaming, as it was a complete and utter waste of time. I'd rather have watched grass grow, at least I could contemplate the meaning of life and have got more out of it.","7/10"

Remember how he left Earth with the Guardians to go find out who he was supposed to be? Apparently, he was supposed to be an idiot. An idiot in a movie with Spy Kids quality CGI, on a Marvel budget.I was looking forward to this so much, only to be disappointed at every turn. The script managed to somehow forget to have any character growth. At the end, Thor hasn't changed. He's had an adventure. His ex girlfriend has died. And a few random unimportant gods have died as well.There's just nothing redeeming about this movie.

This is horrible, I have my wife's sweater and the only reason I can't stay soundly asleep is because the horrible noise which accompanies the horrible cgi, wakes me up all over again.

For MCU fans this will a good piece for entertainment otherwise if you are not a marvel fan you may not like this movie much.Spoiler warning:Giving you a little bit of spoiler : I guess Thor will be the first avenger to get 5th film of his own.

The first Thor film may have been over-serious, but it pulled at the character in different ways and gave it depth; Thor had a genuine soul. This one reduces the character to a running joke about incompetence in anything but fighting - it's as if Marvel (Disney) made the series for a younger and younger audience each go round. All the characters are slight and one-note, the is plot thin and moves fast but randomly, like a drunk on a country road.

"Thor: Love and Thunder","rnavarro-81504","10 July 2023","This was an embarrassment to the MCU, to the late Stan Lee, to Disney.Heavy on cheesy quips, jokes, and one liners. The writers tried far too hard to recreate the fun of Ragnarok, of Guardians, etc. Previous MCU movies had serious action, great visual effects, an interesting storyline, and the occasional humorous moment. Love & Thunder seemed to shoot for being a parody of the MCU lineup. Pointless action scenes that did little for the franchise, a boring storyline, with stabs at humor early and far too often. Many of our favorite characters whittled down to nothing.The soundtrack had potential. Lots (and I mean LOTS!) of Guns & Roses, with even a character named Axl. But like the humor, too much means too much. By comparison look back at Avengers: Endgame. Appropriate music selections throughout, to include that final scene of Cap slow dancing with Peggy Carter to jazz. Something for everyone.The end of the credits tells us ""Thor will return.""

"Thor: Love and Thunder","beornmatt","11 July 2022","Love and Thunder tries way too hard to capture the same humorous vibe as Ragnarok (one of my top MCU films, btw) while telling a very dark story about Gorr the God-Butcher and it misses continually. Hemsworth is great as Thor and did the best he could with what he was given. Christian Bale was head and shoulders above the rest as Gorr, and I wish we'd seen him as a real threat in a serious movie. He could have been a good sympathetic villain like Thanos and I wish I could have seen him in that capacity.Unfortunately, however, everything else falls flat. Waititi's insistence on putting a joke in every scene undercuts the times that he wants to convey emotion and just cheapens everything. The other cast are clearly just there for the payday, especially Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie. I've never been sold on her as the actress for the character and her wooden performance here just reinforces that.All told, I wouldn't even watch this again on Disney+.

I had high hopes with the Gorr the God Butcher storyline, which was excellent in the comics but rushed in the movie. Christian Bale was excellent and should have been given more time. Instead there were distracting aspects of the movie.such as the silly treatment of Zeus and the other gods of the universe. The same goes with many of the jokes. They were funny but it slid into camp with the acting sometimes sloppy. The Jane Forster storyline was OK but not engaging at times with the mixed storylines. Asgard as an amusement park was briefly funny, but that and the heavy inclusion of children came off as campy as well at times. The inclusion of Eternity was also a weak plot device that missed the opportunity to build interest in the universal figures of the MCU.

Why is the drunk mercenary slaver still leading Asgard and called a KING?? Why do the ppl of asgard even put up with this horrible person and havent started an uprising yet.Another strange name thing was with Jane, why does she call herself Thor while wielding mjolnir? Not only does she steal his weapon and garb but also his name. This is never explained in the movie. Oh Nathalie Portperson is beautiful to look at but looked ridiculous in that armor and beefed up chest. The dresses with the metal parts in them from the previous movies fitted her way better.The female gaze scene with thor being shackled, naked, in front of a big crowd would normally be a fine scene. But in this polarized day and age it just shows the double standards of those complaining about female nudity. If it would have been Jane Foster that ended up shackled, naked and humiliated the world would have been 2 small.The movie is way to comical and doesn't treat ANYTHING serious. In Ragnarok it was already going overboard a little but here the gloves came of. Thor losing his brother, father, friends? Lol! Thor losing his home and most of his people, lol!

But still, Thor: Love and Thunder is helluva lot better.In a rare occurrence, the Thor quadrilogy joins both the Spider-Man Home Movies and the Mission: Impossible franchise as the few series that gets progressively better with each chapter. About half-way through this, I thought I liked Ragnarok more. That all changed in the highly enjoyable final act.Thor is BACK, baby. Well, from his Dad-Bod ways and as he's helping out the happy underdogs across the universe, he discovers both Love and Thunderous rage from a God-Butcher. Pray Thor makes it out of this one.The funny thing about this movie that reunites Chris Hemsworth with Natalie Portman: I wasn't 100% looking forward to that reunion prior to starting this adventure-comedy. Truthfully, she is NOT one of my favorite actresses and I'll get right to the point: She practically steals Thor's Thunder throughout this film. She was spectacular and my favorite part of this movie. And this may be my favorite role for her.Now, that said, I thoroughly enjoyed Chris Hemsworth - he was having a ball and it shows he really enjoys entertaining the masses as the title character. The rest of the cast was equally awesome, except, well, The Bland-Batman.I mean, Christian Bale as the Baddie. He was fine, but really uneven. He almost acted like the Joker/Riddler at some moments and then menacingly quiet and composed the next. And back and forth he went. Unfortunately, he was never likable enough to gain ANY sympathy from me - even though his character had well-defined motivation and depth.While this had a KILLER soundtrack, was absolutely hilarious and is technically better than Ragnarok, it's not by much and it's a perfect companion to that third one. Needless to say, if you loved Ragnarok, this will have the same impact for you. And you might as well forget those first two Thors. Just stick with the two best: Ragnarok & Love & Thunder.***Final Thoughts: I HATE that Marvel makes us stay through the credits. Literally, it's my least favorite part of the MCU. BUT, every once in a while, an MCU chapter will change my mind, albeit temporarily. You simply MUST stay through to the very last few seconds. I liked the first one pretty well and LOVED the last one.","2/10"

How could they denigrate everything they did in Ragnorok by producing ths horribly boring, unfunny and life draining chocolate log of a film....It was supposed to be a summer block-buster...

Also, the kids in the movie were asked to punch above their weight to make this is a parody show.Morbius, Thor, Dr. Strange, all these recent marvel movies were only seen due to the brand Marvel. All were mediocre and avoidable cringe fest. They should do better than scamming people.Won't be excited anymore for Marvel. Pinning hopes on DC.","2/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","poseyfan","10 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ta-98251","4 May 2023","Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jace_the_film_guy","8 May 2023","Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax
Best Quote: ""She is to us.""

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","gcsman","7 May 2023","""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","AfricanBro","3 May 2023","Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them. Oh and I forgot to mention it's pretty funny.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","breneff","3 May 2023","This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","josephbannister","4 May 2023","It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel. Trust me this is a great film.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","georgewhittingham1","3 May 2023","A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","coasteraddict-16796","10 May 2023","I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short. I never expected to fall in love with this movie, but it got to me in such a visceral way that I'll never forget the experience of seeing it.The best marvel film, ever. 10/10.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cthirlby","3 May 2023","This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie! Loved it to bits!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ossie85","3 May 2023","This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Mysterygeneration","11 May 2023","The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Chance_Boudreaux19","5 May 2023","So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Jeremy_Urquhart","3 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Stephanie4040","7 August 2023","I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends). While it ends up mostly okay, I'm never watching it again as long as I live. Triggered all sorts of childhood movie PTSD - not sure it needed to be that harsh and traumatising to be honest!","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Her-Excellency","10 May 2023","This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ragingbull_2005","3 September 2023","This packed an emotional wallop.It had old favorites and new & equally memorable additions and was powered by an awesome sound track and the exchanges and dialogues full of fresh wit.It had an eclectic group of friends, trying to save one of them. It had a heart- rending back story.It had a meaner villain than almost every other Marvel studio film, since the Endgame.It did not have a pack of super heroes confronting the next existential threat for all of mankind.It is an almost perfect sendoff to the guardians. It is a James Gunn signature creation, with his creative imprint on the the look, feel and hear of every frame.I had postponed seeing this until now as every other Marvel film, except the second Black Panther, seemed to be derivative of every other film with only minor tweaks.This easily tops ALL of them, by some distance.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Ky-D","5 May 2023","Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","rexmatthewj","3 May 2023","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cardsrock","10 May 2023","This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","GusherPop","4 May 2023","James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","BenW1999","3 May 2023","Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","HardLight","8 May 2023","The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home. But I'm not lying about this.","4/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","srdjan_veljkovic","6 May 2023","It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Ankhenaten91","5 May 2023","One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.","4/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","PizzaBizza","7 May 2023","I am disappointed. Although Guardians 3 is not a bad movie per se, it is definetly the worst of the three.All the sillyness and light hearted jokes of the first two installments seemed just forced: The characters used to argue a lot in the previous movies too, but here the arguments seem more serious and sometimes the friendship actually looks damaged. Rocket gets the spotlight, but most of the background story is simply too dark. I wanted to watch the movie with my kids, but this is not a kids movie. The first two were kind of violent too, but not in this grim, dark and desperate way.Nebula does not seem to fit in the crew, Drax does not do much at all, Groot seems strangely hallow and 'unfinished', only Starlord and Gomorra have a somewhat interesting tension. Both the adult groot and baby groot from 1 and 2 had something going on, young Groot here seems to lack any personality. The writers did not know how to use this character. The actors sometimes played as if it was the last day before summer vacation - just get it done and forget about it.I always liked the family and friendship aspect of the first two, because it was somewhat ridiculed by the characters themselfs (""5 idiots standing in a circle"" from the first, or ""that unsaid thing"" between Gomorra and Starlord or Drax being gentle to Baby-Groot at the end of part 2), but here it's not embedded in the actions anymore. It has to be said, over and over again.For a Grand Finale it often feels too complex, too empty and too forced. Was it a bad movie - no, probably not, but it was for sure not up there with the other two. I will probably re-watch it in a couple of years, hopefully I like it more then. (""Endgame"" also grew on me, so there is hope.)It also sucks that there are so many fake ratings on IMDB, some even don't try to hide it.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","movieman6-413-929510","4 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is the third Guardians of the Galaxy movie in the Marvel movie series. This film is again directed and partly written by James Gunn, who also directed the two previous films.Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is still reeling from the loss of his beloved Gamora (Zoe Saldana). This loss causes him to still not be his old self. During a mission, Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) is injured by this.In order to save him, the other Guardians must confront his creator The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). This is a perfectionist, who is always trying to improve everything. It's probably not very familiar to leave Rocket in his hands.With this third film, James Gunn manages to close his trilogy nicely, but he leaves it in such a way that others could continue with the film series. After this film, James Gunn will resign from Marvel and will now continue as an executive for the DC superhero films. If Marvel decides to use the Guardians of the Galaxy for new further films in their film series, this will probably come across differently compared to the vision that James Gunn had with the series and characters.For his latest Guardians of the Galaxy film, James Gunn also takes a different direction for a change, making this film a bit darker and brutal. For example, there are different animals in the film and although these animals are not real in the film, most of them come across as realistic. When these animals are then modified by the villain of the film, who tries to make them more perfect, they show the best violent images in which this is done. These images are not really suitable for young viewers such as children under ten. Parents should take this into account if their children would like to see this film.In addition to the animals, James Gunn, together with the people who worked on the visual effects for this film, also manages to portray the other aliens in different, creative ways. They've done this with both visual and makeup effects. It sometimes seems as if you are watching a Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Unfortunately, all explosions do not always come across as credible, because with some explosions you can see that they are played on a green screen.The acting is also well done by the film cast. For this third film, most of them also get enough opportunities to play their well-known roles in other ways. Chris Pratt comes across as very depressed, especially in the beginning. Because this film plays on Rocket's backstory, Bradley Cooper now voices a younger version of the same character in addition to his now well-known voice as Rocket. With this third film and the events of the past Marvel films, Zoe Saldana now also gets a chance to portray Gamora's character in a different way. This version of Gamora is also a bit more brutal compared to how the character was portrayed in this way less and less in these films. With this film, she gets more of a chance to respond to the title that the character had in the comics: the deadliest woman in the whole galaxy. The rest of the returning cast also portray their characters in good manners, but not all get the chance to do something special with their characters in this new film. The well-known character from the comics Adam Warlock also finally appears in the Marvel film series. He is played by Will Poulter, but otherwise little special is done with the character. This may be a bit disappointing for fans of the character.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","bastille-852-731547","3 May 2023","When it came out in 2014, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" far exceeded most people's expectations. Don't get me wrong, it's not an earth-shattering masterpiece by any means, but its clever humor, endearing camaraderie between its quirky heroes, entertaining use of 80s music, and uniqueness compared to other Marvel films made it a breath of fresh air that many people really enjoyed. The second film was not as good as the first, but still enjoyable enough. Unfortunately, the third film is very disjointed and lacks any semblance of a compelling overarching story to really work. While devoted Marvel fans will probably enjoy it more than I did, I view the film as overall further evidence of the MCU's decline in quality since the Infinity Saga.In this film, the Guardians have to embark on a mission to protect (an injured) Rocket Raccoon from an evil villain, the High Evolutionary. The film alternates between garden-variety CGI/action setpieces and some surprisingly dark flashbacks to Rocket Raccoon's earlier life. Some viewers will be surprised by these flashbacks and find them to be more disturbing than they would expect from a ""Guardians"" movie. I do not think these scenes push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating (""The Batman,"" for example, contains scenes far more disturbing and graphic,) but parents bringing younger children starting to watch Marvel movies should note that their children could find them upsetting. The juxtaposition between the lighter humor and fun of the Guardians and these more tragic, trauma-based moments does not exactly work very well, since the plot is not compelling enough overall to justify the continued plot progression on both ends. The film's overall story is very generic and forgettable, and significant portions of the film feel surprisingly rather pointless in contributing to the such story. These concerns are intensified by the fact that the third act is pretty weak, and the first two acts don't really build up to it much.The writing and humor are much weaker than the previous two ""Guardians"" films, especially the first one. The comedy here feels surprisingly forced and lazy, rather than genuine and clever. Additionally, at two and a half hours (longer than both of the first two films,) the film's runtime really does overstay its welcome, especially given the relative lack of a consistently compelling plot--or even significant attempts at plot structure. The film still has some mildly entertaining set pieces and a great soundtrack, so it's not a total misfire by any means, but it's very disappointing compared to the previous two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films--especially considering how much less than the sum of its parts this film feels. 5.5/10Note: I saw an advance screening of the film in IMAX. The picture and sound quality were very good on the IMAX screen, and the film seemed to use the IMAX-expanded aspect ratio for nearly all of its running time.","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Mr-Fusion","7 May 2023","I've been chomping at the bit for a new Guardians movie for six years (lookin' at you, Disney management) and overall, I was left satisfied with the film's ending. Some characters complete their arcs, others leave with open doors, it's nice. Narrative and tone are a little messy, but the hallway fight is cool, and the Guardians - when it's about them - fire on all cylinders. I love these people.Where it loses me is Rocket's origin story, and Gunn pushes the animal cruelty way ( ... *way* ... ) too far. It's transparent knife-twisting and I hate it. This is a dark turn for the series, absolutely, but also unbelievably painful.I can't.","4/10"

The efforts they take to save their rocket.2) Some comic moments from Drax.3) A fight sequence when the film about to end in 15 to 20 min, the choreography was superbly taken.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Ayupgeeza","6 May 2023","I loved the first GotG, and enjoyed Vol. 2 a lot. For me they were original, quirky, funny films with an awesome soundtrack, great action sequences and a real feel-good factor to them.This third instalment attempts to carry some of those traits over, but it also wants to be a serious, emotional film as it works its way through Rocket's tortuous back story. These two opposing threads make for uncomfortable bedfellows, and it hits from the very start of the movie. Any anticipation I felt for the film dissipated rapidly in the first 10 very depressing minutes, and I struggled to regain much enthusiasm for it. Perhaps this was an inevitable consequence following the events of the last Avengers movie, but even so I didn't feel it was handled all that well.This was despite a pretty engaging revenge plot and a compelling and superbly portrayed primary antagonist. Adam Warlock was a welcome if somewhat underexplored addition to the cast, and a wide variety of imaginative and frequently grizzly selection of supporting characters were generally a bonus.In fact it was the Guardians themselves who disappointed. Rocket and Star-Lord were largely humourless throughout. The three female guardians, including - strangely - Mantis, melded into the same universally angry, shouty character. Only Drax seemed to me to add value, as he was both funny and had a nice bit of character development rolled into it.All in all, though this wasn't a bad film, it wasn't the film I was hoping it would be.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","bastos","5 February 2024","I've talked about this before, how expectations can mold your appreciation of a movie, so let me tell you what my mindset was coming into this one. I liked the first Guardians, although not as much as everyone else as I think Ronan is such a forgettable villain. I really didn't like the second one and thought it was a huge step down from the first one, it felt rushed and had another very weak villain. Marvel was coming off of a terrible string of movies and I even didn't like the Guardians Christmas special. I was still a fan of James Gunn though, and loved his Suicide Squad so there was that to look forward to. So, to say I wasn't expecting to like this one as much as I did is the understatement of the year. Another thing I wanted to talk about after watching this movie, was the much talked about superhero fatigue. When people mention it I think they tend to dismiss or forget that two incredible superhero movies came out this year alone (the other one being the Spiderverse movie, of course), so it just proves that if well written and well executed a superhero movie can still be really good, what people are tired is the terrible writing and lack of originality that populates most superhero movies released nowadays. Anyway, with all that out of the way, let me tell you just how much I loved this movie. It is incredibly well written, interweaving character development, emotional set pieces, comedy and action like it's nothing, with the highlight for me being the characters which are the heart of this thing. I mean, Star-Lord, Rocket, Gamora, Nebula, Drax, Mantis, Groot, even all the supporting characters like Cosmo, Kraglin or Adam Warlock, they're all so likable that you can probably ask ten different persons which one is their favorite, and you might get ten different answers. That's a testament of how good they all are! Execution wise, this is a beautiful movie, very well directed and the VFX for a change are actually good and serve to enhance the story. My only nitpick might be the villain that, although good conceptually and probably the best of this trilogy, is not as memorable as everything else, something that seems to plague all Gunn movies. Anyway, I really, really liked this movie and it is easily in my top five MCU movies. Highly recommended.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","brandonmckay8","4 May 2023","I just left the cinema & my immediate thoughts was that was quite possibly the best of the Guardians of the Galaxy series & the best MCU film since No Way Home (or possibly endgame) it's definitely one I'll be seeing again! It's a beautifully written film with so much great action sequences, comedic scenes & some really heart touching moments. The backstory for Rocket really messes you up seeing what he went through & how he had to witness all his friends being slaughtered. Although it makes you believe it at times thankfully none of the Guardians actually pass but they do split in an emotional finale. Star-Lord finally decides to stop running & returns home to Earth to see his grand father! The final dance scene was so enjoyable. There are two post credit scenes so make sure to say to the end!","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dstan-71445","29 May 2023","Jesus wept! Why? Why does Marvel feel the need to shove it's tasteless humor in everything? Why not spare the only franchise ,that still had a soul left, from all the cheesiness and vapidness Marvel is lambasted for? Worst one of the trilogy if I am to be honest.Sitting through, my rating for the movie kept on dwindling and I reached a point where I was eager for it to end. GOTG 3 flaws were egregious. Compared to Marvel's recent releases this one is at least watchable but parallel to the series's prior movies, it's horrendous.Let's start with the humor. Part 1 had witty, timely, germane lines that would crack you up. Second one had some marvel goofiness but the engaging drama it had balanced it out. This one is chock-full of lazy, unfunny, kiddish and annoying lines meant to be amusing. Filled to the brim with marvel style goofiness which kept clashing with the gloomy story they were trying to tell. The first one was perfect without trying to appease the under 10 crowd with puerile humor.Drax is a great example. On the first one, he was a furious soul looking to avenge his massacred family but also a bit odd, nescient and irrational. Second movie made him slightly clownish but his grim soul and character was intact. Here, he's a buffon. A jester for pleasing the gang and amusing kids. Stripped of all his deep background and essence, he's merely the original character I knew and loved. An insult to fans, what they did to his character.The hella dragged out story was not engaging in the least. Rocket, my favorite character, was shorn of all his charm and made to sit this one out. He was replaced by none other than Mantis, the goofiest of all, chosen to entertain the kiddos. She kinda reminds me of my kindergarten teacher with the way she acts. Her silliness was endurable on the 2nd one cause there was some drama attached to her with Ego and all, but here she gets the most runtime and Gawd she's obnoxious.The oversentimental animal scenes were extremely cringe and cheesy. We don't know the characters so expecting us to sympathize for them cause they have big, puppy eyes is very lazy. The lines exchanged were very tacky and sitting through those was the hardest. Quill reminiscing about Gamora was heart wrenching because their relationship was well developed and we already are familiar with the characters. I can't say the same for Rocket's friends.( Also, Rocket's craftsmanship was gained through experience, not innate skill. Him being gifted felt like a retcon ).Chukwudi Iwuji as High Evolutionary did emote well and definitely is a more interesting villain than Jonathan Majors. Nevertheless, his character's motivation and goal was vague ( Making perfect beings, but how perfect? ) and he was too powerful. A villain deemed a God killed by stab to the heart. How pathetic! Same as Wanda, he was built up as an invincible demigod but perished in the most dissatisfying fashion.The screenplay was full of tired, generic lines and the CGI and costume was mostly bad. Honey I shrunk the kids level. All our main characters seem tired and worn out. Some scenes and lines were repeated from the earlier works. The music wasn't as catchy as the prior ones, as if they exhausted their playlist. 2 hrs was enough to tell the story they felt like telling. Riding out the whole thing was not a delight, I tell you.Adam Warlock was unnecessary and did not help in developing the story in any manner. The sequel and spin-off baiting finale where all the characters depart for no reason but to wander on to their own respective shows sealed it for me. At that point, I decided this flick deserves nothing but a 1/10. I genuinely feel distraught Marvel's formulaicness and childishness got to my favorite flick.","1/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","JoshuaMercott","28 July 2023","Exploring Rocket Raccoon's origin story let ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" give one of its most famous characters well-deserved and heartfelt attention.Technically, this is a story forty years in the making. Because Rocket's first entry goes back to the Marvel Preview #7 comic book titled ""The Sword in the Star"". There have since been several other comic books that delved into this character's life and times, capturing his badassery and charisma.In ""Vol. 3"" James Gunn gave us a powerful and profound plotline, blessed with more than a few endearing moments and regaling soundtracks.It was also nice to see Gamora in a partially negative role, and not to forget Sylvester Stallone (as Stakar Ogord). In this timeline (emphasis on the word), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana) was no longer with the titular Guardians. She was brought back following the undoing of Thanos's work after ""Infinity War"". But she was back to being a ruthless Ravager with no memory of her connection to Peter and the Guardians.Meanwhile Peter Quill, after a period of drunken love-lorn mourning, found himself gathering the Guardians and embarking on a timed mission to save Rocket's life or risk losing his friend forever.Next, everything about Adam Warlock (played by Will Poulter) - one of the villains at the heart of this movie - was both exciting and hilarious. He and Rocket had something in common, especially the fact that they were both genetically engineered beings. This made Rocket 'proprietary technology' (i.e., Subject 89P13) and the High Evolutionary, working under Oracle Corporation, sent Adam to collect.With his ability to manipulate energy and matter, the 'Cosmic Crusader' was given an amazing live-action spin in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". His first comic-book entry was in ""Fantastic Four #66"" (published, 1967) and he's appeared in several stories since.I wish they found someone who looked more like the Adam Warlock from the comics, but Poulter's acting chops were more than adequate compensation. Besides, he gradually became a force to reckon with in the comics. Here in the movie, the character was just getting started. Hence his silly-funny 'newborn' incompetence.The big-bad in ""Vol. 3"" was the High Evolutionary. In keeping with his trail of destruction in comic-book lore, the 'mad geneticist' continued to be a devastating player in the movie. He broke more than just innocent bodies with his sick and unethical experiments, he also traumatized their souls. Chukwudi Iwuji's riveting performance will not soon be forgotten.On a lighter note, the movie contained a good amount of humor and hilarity. Drax, Mantis, Nebula, and Star Lord's comedic timing was *chef's kiss*. Rocket Raccoon typically delivered the punchlines, but in this movie he had more dark and poignant moments than funny ones. I loved the way they balanced it all without compromising characterization value.Everything about Counter-Earth was cleverly conceived and crafted. It evoked dark memories of what I'd seen in the 1996 movie ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" (based on the novel by H. G. Wells).The way Adam Warlock later turned good and helped save Peter Quill was a major highlight. Groot contributed some captivating moments as well. Most of the jokes in the movie were laugh-out-loud funny and the plot lingered in memory even after the end credits rolled.Finally, the sheer empathy they wove around Rocket Raccoon in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" was nothing short of masterful. Needless to say, James Gunn certainly has the Midas touch.","8/10"

The cosmic landscapes burst with vibrant colours, immersing the audience in a mesmerizing universe filled with strange creatures and breathtaking locales. The action sequences, whether in space or on solid ground, are a visual feast that effortlessly combines thrilling combat with the trademark humor of the Guardians.The chemistry among the cast remains as potent as ever.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","851222","6 May 2023","Greetings from Lithuania.""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume"" 3 did not felt anything different from last movies made by Marvel - it's running time felt to long, it was overstuffed with plots, and homour was in its most scenes. I loved the first movie because it was so unique and fun, but this one while OK film to see it once didn't left me impressed. There was a great segments involving Rockets past (no spoilers), and i liked the villain for the most part, but sometimes less is better, and for this movie more tight plot could worked better.Overall, 3rd part was better for me then the 2nd one, but felt short from how good the first movie was. An enjoyable movie to see it once but nothing more.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","untilnow99","9 September 2023","The message regarding the cruelty and suffering of lab animals is loud and clear in this movie. As a decades-long animal rights activist, I really appreciate the educational merits of including that content in a blockbuster movie. Thank you, writers, for that.I loved the first two Guardians of the Galaxy installments and have seen them each at least a few times. This one, though? All throughout viewing this, all I could think was: ""Well . . . I can't see myself ever watching this again.""As other reviewers have pointed out, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 lacks the luster and humor of the first two movies. Sure, there are loads of terrifically innovative aliens in this one. Lots of action. A great deal of character exposition and the truly heartfelt theme re: how The Guardians have all learned to love and respect one another.That said, I had a real problem with certain aspects. Remember the ""Tell"" in Mad Max 2, where all the little kids are gathered and the story is told, in a background of glimmering firelight, of how the adults left all the kids behind? A sort of modern day take on Aboriginal ""dreaming"" and storytelling/lore. I always hated that part of the MM movies. Really cringe-worthy. Feral kid and all of that. Gag.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 introduces a slew of tow-headed children into the story and . . . I'm guessing the writers thought this would make the movie more appealing to kids and parents with kids? All I know is ---- ugh. Just seemed to be stuck in there, plot-wise, and to serve no purpose whatsoever. Joob joob. Weren't the Ewoks saying that in some Star Wars flick?And the cosmonaut dog was just plain lame. The only good thing about that character was how it showed people that calling their dog a ""bad dog"" isn't a nice way to treat your dog. (Always praise your dog, at every opportunity.)Okay. I'll stop now. I'm severely disappointed in this movie. And I did look up those insane tweets that James Gunn posted. Hollywood certainly can be forgiving. That dude is one creepy guy.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ethanbresnett","3 May 2023","I think it's fair to say that since Endgame Marvel's output has been littered with as many misses as hits. After the thoroughly disappointing Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and James Gunn well and truly delivers with Guardians Vol. 3.This is easily the most fun I've had with a superhero film in a long time. It is funny, thrilling, and surprisingly emotional. Fans who have been following these characters for the last 10 years, get ready for such a satisfying and emotional journey.What makes the Guardians so good is that they stand out. Superhero films are becoming far too formulaic and blending into one another, but the Guardians films somehow manage to buck this trend. Sure, the story follows the well trodden superhero film structure at its core and there are lots of familiar cliches and tropes, but the dressing around these things feels vibrant, distinct, and cared for.The characters remain unique and interesting, with great performances behind them all. I was particularly impressed with Pom Klementieff in this film, who steals the show in my opinion with her emotion and humour. All of the performances are great though, with another shout out to Chukwudi Iwuji for a captivating performance.The story is full of emotion, and is quite possibly the most emotional and punchy Marvel film yet. It brought me to tears and I could hear plenty of others in the theatre feeling a similar way! It's also really funny too with so many laugh out loud moments. James Gunn excelled himself with this script in every way.Saying that, I do think some story elements feel a little bit clunky, and some characters are a little surplus to requirements, but these are minor criticisms in the grand scheme of things.The action sequences are well done. They aren't mind blowing, but much more emphasis is put into story and character than action so this isn't necessarily a bad thing.I will also say that despite being two and a half hours this film doesn't feel long at all. It never once drags and every scene feels needed and adds something to the whole picture.Guardians Vol 3. Is fun, emotional, and just a joy to watch. A brilliant return to form for the MCU.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","PartialMovieViewer","11 June 2023","Split story - story 1: hard to follow and/or care about either. Grown-up Rocket is excellent - while the garbage, tear jerky garbage about the character, stank and drawn out. Where were the writers, editors and director? Story 2: special affects and CGI were the overacted stars in this one. The rare good and funny moments the key heroes interacted were way too sparse. I got exhausted watching and listening to pointless explosions, ugliest aliens and stars plugged in for no apparent reason. Love Nathan Fillion, but his talents were wasted on such a useless character.Bad: way too long, story and plot were omitted, good writing mixed with horrible writing, not enough interaction between key characters and worst, way too much CGI. Also - music? Soundtrack? What was that song? There was so many artists from the 70s and 80s to chose from - and second rate dribble was selected. Painfully too loud. And Groot has spent too long at the gym.Good: as much as I will miss these main stars in these rolls, they're gone. Chris Pratt is great along with the others. Nice sign-off. The first movie screamed for a sequel and the 2nd was good - not near as great as the first - but good...and another sequel was needed. After seeing this one, the second one should have been the end.Please. No more GOTG.","1/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","fernandoschiavi","10 January 2024","If someone talked about Guardians of the Galaxy in 2013, it is certain that very few people would know how to describe this group of heroes. Released in 2014, the first Guardians was the film fans needed, at the right time. Who would have thought that a tree, a raccoon, a daughter of Thanos, a looter and a vengeful father would dictate the tone of team-up films for years to come, and become part of pop culture history once and for all. Now, almost a decade after that beginning, the story of the most misfit characters in the galaxy comes to an end with a bang. Without further ado, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 3"" is a work with soul, charisma, personality and love. It's a film that closes arcs and consolidates that team as the most important after the Avengers.Proposed as the last part of a trilogy, ""Volume 3"" comes to close the Guardians of the Galaxy Trilogy in a more than worthy way, delivering the arc closures that each of its components deserved, including Gamora from another universe (Zoe Saldana). While the film itself has its stumbles, almost all of them due to the typically Hollywood bloat of Gunn's script, it is clearly noticeable the filmmaker's affection for the characters he made popular by inserting his brand of playful humor and lots of music into the film's DNA. His (re)creations, as he tries his best to dedicate this second sequel to each of them almost equally, from Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) to Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), through Drax (Dave Bautista), Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and Groot (Vin Diesel) and reaching Nebula (Karen Gillan) who has her participation and importance greatly expanded. Even Cosmo (Maria Bakalova), included in the ""Holiday Special"" to more directly pay homage to the dog Laika on whom the original character was based) and Kraglin Obfonteri (Sean Gunn) have great space in the film to show their value.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes it easy to ignore its missteps thanks to its huge setbacks. Aware of what the public expects from a group adventure, James Gunn brings back the renowned mix of superhero, science fiction and comedy with touches of nostalgia. A formula improved throughout the trilogy and which reaches its peak here. The first proof that the film hits the target is in the evolution of its characters. Unlike other Marvel heroes, who seem to regress with each film, each member of the team carries with them the growth acquired throughout the journey. A rewarding feeling that enhances the experience by valuing the background of the characters and the audience that has followed them for years. It's a relief to see the maturation of names like Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), who could easily go through the entire MCU following the basic characteristics of when they were introduced. The same happens to Groot (Vin Diesel), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), who develop new characteristics without abandoning the comic relief. Even Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who has a plausible reason to regress, brings a complexity that avoids the taste for repetition.The evolution of the characters is accompanied by the growth in the scope of the production - something that seemed unlikely considering that the Guardians' setting is literally the Galaxy. In his last round with the characters, Gunn commands each sequence with as much excitement as possible, using different tools to keep the viewer involved, dazzled and surprised. Sometimes all of this together. Not surprisingly, the director makes the bold decision to treat ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" as a true biblical epic. There is a constant feeling that the characters are dealing with things larger than life, including events that make direct parallels with Christian scriptures without sounding corny. An approach that highlights the grandeur with which the director sees the work and that makes perfect sense with the film's major conflict: the confrontation with the creator himself.Although Gunn maintains his comedic signature, the backdrop of the third ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" film is the darkest and most sinister of all, as Rocket's past, seen in the character's memories and hallucinations, is a horror festival with extremely cruel experiments on animals at the hands of a villain obsessed with creating the perfect breed, a true space Dr. Moureau. In fact, Dr. Moureau is not enough to characterize the insane character that Iwuji embodies in a frightening way, varying between glassy eyes and complete insanity, as he is more like an animal Dr. Mengele, a monster capable of anything to, in fact, his crazy head, acting as God. If the MCU has largely always failed its villains, here Gunn sculpts an irredeemable figure, someone who anyone would be very happy to slaughter and who the script, unlike the current irritating craze, doesn't dedicate a single piece of dialogue to creating an ""explanation"". For him to be as he is. It is evil in its pure form, with no greater plans than those dictated by his horrible and perverse obsession, something that works especially well considering that the central theme of the film is, as clich√© as it may sound, the love we feel for the members of our family, whether by blood or by the one we choose to belong to.While the big villain really deserves all our anger, the variety of settings and creatures - something not exactly uncommon in the Guardians of the Galaxy films - deserves all the praise, especially as it is even greater here. Not only Knowhere, which appears only at the beginning and at the end, comes to life under the ""government"" of the Guardians, with streets, alleys and a thriving population that convinces even knowing that it is inside the basically rotting skull of a Celestial, but the other scenarios are also worth taking off your hat. There is the aforementioned space mega-laboratory that is ""built"" from living mass and, therefore, is basically just disgusting, giving a thousand opportunities to designers who opted for a bizarr* kits*h approach; there is Counter-Earth and its population of animals genetically and cybernetically altered by the High Evolutionary, with the prosthetics, makeup and practical effects team probably having to work more than 24 hours a day to create what we see on the big screen and there is, finally , the villain's ship which, despite being the typical ""bandit headquarters"", with even a color palette that doesn't allow us to forget that for a second, gains extra layers for also being a horrible laboratory prison where he carries out his experiments on living beings, basically Dr. Moreau's island or, of course, Dr. Mengele's extermination camp.Even though it doesn't forcefully open spaces for the entry of other figures from the Marvel Universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" certainly takes a step towards the future. Furthermore, the threat is not a being with unimaginable powers that can decimate part of the galaxy with the snap of a finger or someone with the ability to freely move through the multiverse. In this third solo adventure of the Guardians of the Galaxy, the enemy symbolizes the barrier to be overcome for the new hero to rise to protagonism. There is a psychoanalytic aspect to this idea of a ""son"" subjugating the oppressive figure of the ""father"" in search of emancipation. Therefore, Rocket is placed against a recent trend at Marvel, that of elaborating on the emotional and psychological maturation of superheroes through fatherhood. He is the creation, the creature that needs to rebel against the purposes of the crazy replica of Dr. Frankenstein in order to step out of the shadow and take his rightful place in the sun. But, before the warrior raccoon rises up and takes up arms, we have good doses of action packed with a very special soundtrack and recurring jokes with the characters' weaknesses. Quill meets Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Nebula (Karen Gillan) seems jealous, Drax (Dave Bautista) remains clueless and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) gains deserved prominence. James Gunn's irreverent touch continues to work.It doesn't take long to realize that Marvel's newest feature film is a watershed in the group's history. Especially in the third act, death and separation are constant elements. Still within the personality imprinted by James Gunn in a calculated universe so prone to standardization, the digital effects are well combined with the practical ones in order to not leave the feeling of a textured screen in the scenarios and fights. The action appears to offer catharsis in circumstances in which we are called upon to root for redemptions, comebacks and the unlikely victory of the misfits over the figure who claims the right to sit on the throne destined for divinities. This ""Vol. 3"" does not present anything so new, as its guiding principle is to maintain the coherence established by the two features that preceded it. Including the communist bi*ch boosted by telekinetic powers (she could be better used in the plot), the film emphasizes friendship as fundamental to the Guardians' success. Resonating something from Rocket's sad past, James Gunn defends the idea that family is what welcomes and supports us, not necessarily the other branches and roots of our family tree.Navigating between comedy, action and even horror, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" presents its final card: emotion. Doing justice to the franchise, which is full of simple and moving moments, the final chapter is not far behind. Despite following a path that occasionally borders on the appealing in terms of suffering, the narrative builds moments of genuine emotion. A commotion that varies with the level of attachment to the characters, but that can easily bring tears. It is with this mixture that the Guardians of the Galaxy - at least this version of the team - say goodbye to the Marvel universe.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","averagedeveloper","31 January 2024","It is obvious that mcu has gone downhill and made a mess of things as it entered the series period after Endgame. They completely ruined the multiverse fiction that they tried to put at the center in the new phase. The accusations against the actor who played the main villain of the new phase were the last nail in the coffin of that long-running fiction structure of the mcu. What saved this movie was that it told an independent story without getting involved in all of this. And achive to make good use of one of the most interesting villains they have.The movie looks very good visually and the actors do their part very well. That is given. They were always successful visually and in casting good actors. They handled a subject that touches the soft spot of people who sensitive about animal testing and ethics very well, with a villain in a comic book style that suits them. It's very clearly a children's movie. This is a genre and it does not mean that the movie is bad or only children should watch it. As a 30-year-old adult, I watched the movie with pleasure, looking forward to our heroes defeating the bad guy and kicking his ass.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jamesmcconnon","6 May 2023","I'd have maybe gone 6.5 if it was an option.I do think it was worth seeing on the big screen, but it wasn't as good as the first two, and it kind of felt unfinished in places. I thought rocket's story worked really well, and got me a bit tearful in places.But Will Pouter? I liked where he started and where he ended, but the whole middle seemed to be missing. I liked that people got to see more in Drax even if he didn't see more in himself.Despite being over 2.5 hours long, it didn't feel like it overstayed it's welcome. 1
You know, there was enough good stuff to make it worthwhile, but you did have to ignore the missing beats in a lot of the subplots.Overall, I thought it was like that one good song on an album by a band in a slump that's not as good as there best stuff but is just about good enough to make you think they still have something going on.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sevskirita","30 October 2023","This series has long been centered around the theme of not running away from your pain, and this movie continues this but also sets focus on the theme of not just facing your pain but actively repairing it.Peter and Rocket both run for the comfort of other people, creating negative circumstances like Peter vying for a woman who will not love him. The antagonist also plays on this theme, torching every mistake he makes in the comforting hope of an impossible future.Paired with things like animal experimentation, Quill's lost girlfriend, etc., it is very similar to Guardians of the Galaxy 1. And much like that first movie, its execution fumbles the story and emotional potential.However, whereas GotG 1 had its potential undercut by larger problems, such as an over reliance on flat exposition, this movie's problems are more subtle and don't have an easy common thread to generalize the problem with the movie.One of the earliest off-beats I noticed was when Nebula witnesses Rocket's origin. It's pretty profound and inspired to have one victim of cybernetic torture witness their friend's hidden past of being cybernetically experimented on. In theory it makes for a great scene, but it is weirdly undercut by Nebula one-upping her own pain by saying Rocket's was worse.Firstly, how?? Rocket is mostly bodily intact, and the experiments done on him we're not intended for deliberate punishment and torture like Nebula's was. Nebula's anatomy is much more grotesque and implied to be extensively manipulated down to her mind and bones, whereas Rocket's seem less deep.Secondly, this is an opportunity to establish an emotional connection between Nebula and Rocket, clumsily using it to say Rocket's pain is worse breaks that connection and implies that the torture hasn't been adequately shown to the audience and has to be told to us. Weird.The second thing that threw me off was the implied existence of God during the Rocket Heaven scene. I understand that there being a happy afterlife poses a considerably better way to look at Batch 89's deaths, but I can't say how odd it comes in such a secular universe. I'm an atheist so I'm not sure I would ever find this compelling, but I do think I would have been less blindsided and more able to appreciate the moment had the theme of there being an actual God been developed.Much of the finale threw me off in fact. One of the biggest things was all the side character plot resolutions. Themes like being a follower vs being who you want to be were never really explored with Mantis until the very last second. Or Kraglin and not listening to his heart.There was also weird missed opportunities, like no child coming up to hold Drax's hand as Mantis leaves, showing how the temporary hole his friend leaves can be filled by being a good role model to the next generation. Also I can't really track what the whole ""dancing is for idiots"" thing was about and why Drax danced at the end. What was the thematic conflict going on there?And finally, Peter expecting to only save the ""higher life forms"" is a really odd moment. This valuing one life over another thing is never really developed as a trait in the rest of the Guardians, but suddenly it's implied that Peter did have this value and it's immediately resolved by Peter and the Guardians helping Rocket save a bunch of animals.Although this feels like a pretty big thematic gap in Rocket and Peter's stories, otherwise they are done pretty perfectly in comparison to the rest. Peter's arc about not using crutches in life and repairing his past is executed with no falter, and Rocket's acceptance of his past and righting the wrongs done to him felt very fulfilling (aside from the aforementioned sudden theology insertion and the weird incomplete resolution of his loneliness with the Guardians half broken up at the end). Rocket's is probably one of my favorite in fiction.So I do think this movie is kinda overrated. The idea of it really is great and explains why people like it, but being attentive clues you into some big thematic and execution issues that make the emotional moments feel a bit off and less than you were expecting. I'd give the movie a 8/10 for being pretty emotionally compelling and funny but ultimately having some large hidden issues and execution problems.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Barbouzes","22 May 2023","The first GOTG was fun and fresh: loved the humour and the banter between the insane characters. In this 3rd installment, the raccoon was doing the best acting...and yet he is a CGI puppet!!! Need I say more? His backstory was compelling and well brought on, although certainly and forcefully designed to bring on tears. I was surprised to hear kids in the theater where I saw the movie: this film is dark in substance, amazingly violent, sometime disturbing (the mangled animals -as CGI as they were-, distressed me greatly) and the many scenes of ""friendly"" characters screaming at each other instead of having a conversation, far from being humorous, were tedious and upsetting. In short, it is too violent for children, and the plot is too childish for adults. Time to retire the series. Enough with the green screen and the galactic universes with guns and a thousand explosions. Bring on real writers and real characters.","5/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","eoinpgeary","3 May 2023","Wow !By far the best entry into the Guardians movies and up there with some of the best Marvel movies in general. The story isn't at all what I guessed from the trailers but as spoiler free as I can, a guardian gets injured and the rest of the guardians must band together to help save their life.We get the backstory of Rocket and it's heartbreaking, the high evolutionary is one of the meanest we have seen in the movies. He is cruelty with no bounds, no justification just evil.The action is great and the CG is the best it has been in a long while, the music is perfect such a perfected list that suits the movie to the ground.Stand outs are Drax, Mantis, flashback rocket and I must say Nebulas arc in her MCU journey is great !!The stakes are high, the heart is felt, tears swelled and overall I had a fantastic time, the perfect ending to one of Marvels best trilogy.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","boydwalters","10 July 2023","This shouldn't even be compared to the first two Guardians of the Galaxy films ... The first was genius the second very good ... This thing is just a total mess ... The writing is dreadful, there's no flow, there NO LAUGHS, even the colours and characters are muted ... If you had set out to kill a ""franchise"", this is certainly how you would go about it ... Its grim folks ... It seems all the characters are suffering from depression ... And its just a load of scenes ( none of them memorable ) shoved together to kill time ... NO JOY ... NO EXCITMENT ... NO MISCHIEF ... CLUELESS WRITERS ... BADLY DIRECTED ... NO REDEMING QUALITIES WHATSOEVER ... AN INSULT TO THE WORK OF ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE FIRST TWO FILMS ... FLUSH IT ... ITS POO.","2/10"

The movie was just so beautiful is so many ways!! All the characters shined and got equal screen time, really showed them all as an equal team! The story was touching and meaningful, the performance from the entire cast were phenomenal, a certain scene with Pratt broke my heart because he delivered an amazing nuanced performance, same with the rest of the cast, they all delivered amazing performances in regards to emotional scenes, action and comedy!! The cinematography and music were excellent!! So glad James Gunn returned to direct it. I'm going to miss the Guardians and this incredible cast so much!!!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","simplygk","3 May 2023","9 years, 6 movies and one special presentation later... its time to say goodbye to our guardians. The movie was done in typical Guardians style with some kick ass tunes and plenty of laughs but this movie had so much more heart than the previous 2 titles. The story mainly focuses on Rockets backstory, which is absolutely tragic and heartbreaking. The only disappointing thing was Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, he was powerful enough but portrayed as a child and kind of stupid... basically like drax, but less funny. If ypu enjoyed the previous 2 guardians movies then I highly recommend you go check this out. Definitely one of the better MCU movies since Endgame.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","destinychild2014","12 September 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy 3 isn't just the best Marvel movie for me, but my No 1 movie ever, dethroning Drive from that spot. The reason? Rocket...Rocket is my favorite character ever because he is me (and also more adorable, more smart and more couragious, I'm not any of those things).He is me though because I'm a misunderstood little man that pushes everyone away, being a jerk and a smartass to most people because i don't want to experience loosing my friends and being left alone, outcasted by everyone because I'm different, weird and unfitting as it happened on my childhood...And what happens to Rocket in this trilogy is my ultimate fantasy. Finding people who slowly will love me so much that are able to sacrifice everything for me as i would do for them. Almost impossible in real life but having 3 movies (more if you count the Avengers movies that the guardians take part) that portrayed my fantasy it's just the recipe for the ultimate entertainment package. (Plus triple the action, the jokes and drama from the other movies).So i have to thank with all my heart all the cast and crew (maybe James Gunn a bit more then any other) for creating something that i can rewatch a million times and hope that in a galaxy far far a way, an alternative me had experienced the love and recognition that Rockets has in this marvelous trilogy...Thank you all...PS for Marvel: Take an example, Marvel Studios and follow through this masterpiece and you'll be able to fix any problem you have after the mediocre Phase 4 and on...","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Xstal","8 May 2023","The evolution of the franchise gets to three, with the origins of Rocket revealed to thee, as we find out where he's from, the torment he had to succumb, by a man who spliced his genes, as a baby. As you'd expect, there's overwhelming CGI, with conjured creatures of magnificence and style, cast from the past, is reconvened, chasing down almighty fiend, a new hero is a dog, who can defy. After Ant Man (3) this is so much more engaging, you will not leave the screen annoyed and slightly raging, in fact you may just shed a tear, with a story to endear, as those trapped behind locked doors, are freed from cages.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","marcinpietrzyk-74214","21 May 2023","Marvel seems to be making contest for the ugliest world created in its movies. The world in the latest Ant Man looks like fungus under the microscope. While the world in this one is full of weird creatures that look like they were taken from this H. G. Wells book 'The Island of Dr Moreau'. The movie is weak. Definitely the weakest of all three Guardians of Galaxy movies. I guess it was supposed to be emotional. But it's not. It fails even there, because all these creatures are so grotesque. It still has good music though, but that's the only plus I can think of. Also, why is Gamora even there? She died god damn it. But sure, in sci - fi it's not a problem, let's just tell the viewers that the new Gamora is from the parallel universe. Of course I have nothing against Zoe Saldana. She's incredibly talented and so cute. But she shouldn't be there.And of course this overblown 8,3 rating. No this, movie is not 8,3. It's not even 3. I don't know what is happening with Marvel but still not even one good movie since Avengers Infinity War / Endgame.","2/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","NS-movie-reviews","20 May 2023","I am not ashamed to say this: I cried multiple times during this movie. And you know what? After far too many heartless, dull, pointless MCU projects that followed End Game, it was so nice to FEEL SOMETHING again while watching a Marvel movie. To feel the emotion behind the characters and the purpose of the story.Guardians rounds out as the strongest overall trilogy of the MCU. The ending was beautiful and poignant, capping off an amazing run for the protectors of outer space.This movie was able to be visually dazzling with CGI and effects, but avoid th recent pitfall of letting those things be the bulk of a movie. They're merely background; a means to tell a great story. The way, I feel, it should be.Thank you, James Gunn (and crew)!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","masonsaul","3 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 delivers all the humour and inventive action you expect but is at its strongest when exploring its darkest moments, offering an emotionally satisfying goodbye to the best family in the MCU as they all face the music and finally confront their trauma. It also feels like a vital piece of unchecked creativity in a cinematic universe growing increasingly stale.The Guardians films have always stood out within the greater Marvel universe but after the hit and miss nature of phase 4 and phase 5 getting off to a terrible start with Quantumania, it's honestly kinda baffling that this beautiful, proactive and personal movie is even remotely linked to all of that.Chris Pratt is just as strong as before as Peter Quill, there's always been a sadness beneath the charming exterior but after all the previous losses its starting to come to the surface in terrific fashion as he's determined to protect his family this time around. Zoe Salda√±a's performance is a lot different to what's come before, giving this version of Gamora a fresh personality and relationship with the other Guardians.Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the emotional core of this one, so much time is spent exploring his past and it leads to the most emotionally devastating moments and he absolutely brings it. Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff remain really funny throughout but the film wisely still takes time to offer reminders of their dramatic chops as well.Karen Gillan has only gotten better with each film and gets the most to do in this one. Seeing her grow from antagonist to equal has been one of the biggest and best surprises of the trilogy. Chukwudi Iwuji is an amazing villain, eschewing the usual tortured past of most villains for a character who is just plain evil and larger than life, played to perfection.James Gunn's direction is incredible. He's clearly pushing himself creatively, technically and emotionally throughout to deliver the swansong these characters deserve and its so satisfying to watch. There's also a hallway fight done all in one take that's just one of the most thrilling things in the entirety of the MCU.Definitely worthy of the mention is the CG, which is surprisingly good. Recently that has been on a major downward spiral for which Marvel can only blame themselves for their unreasonable deadlines and inability to plan. Which is why its so nice to see one of these where it looks good throughout, emphasising what can be achieved when these actually have a visionary with a plan.Finally, the music by John Murphy shares more stylistically with The Suicide Squad opposed to Tyler Bates work on the previous 2 but it still remembers to use that iconic theme at the right moment and Awesome Mix - Vol 3 is excellent. No longer focusing on a single decade it creates something much more wild and unique.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","renegadeviking-271-528568","27 July 2023","Marvel's oddball superhero team are back in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, and this time writer-director James Gunn goes for broke with an action packed spectacular that's rich with emotional depth. It also sets in motion a reasonably satisfying finale for these fan-favourite characters who we have grown to know and love over their many appearances in the MCU. This blockbusting sequel catches up with the Guardians who have made their new HQ in the rebuilt Kowhere, a huge mining facility built inside a Celestial's skull. Unusually, the film initially quite a somber tone, as some of the Guardians are in a somewhat reflective mood. The Guardians, comprising of : Peter Quill, otherwise known as Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), an easy-going manchild obsessed by rock and pop anthems, the tough taking racoon, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Gamora (Zoe Salda√±a) the green-skinned assassin, her cyborg sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), the lovable walking tree Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), the humourless warrior Drax (Dave Bautista), and the empathic Mantis (Pom Klementieff) are all back for James Gunn's MCU swan song to round off the Guardians trilogy in fine style.The melancholy is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Adam Warlock (Will Poulter , a super buff golden assassin. His brutal attack is eventually repelled by the Guardians, but not before Rocket has been fatally wounded. After discovering Rocket has a kill switch in his chest that prevents him from undergoing life saving surgery, the Guardians have no choice but to embark on a dangerous heist mission, along with The Ravagers and a reluctant Gamora, to steal a code from a biotech company. If that wasn't enough for them to contend with they will also have to confront the powerful High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Lwuji), who originally created Rocked as part of his scheme to genetically engineer a master race.The ensemble cast are all on especially fine for throughout. Each have made their roles their own now, the team dynamic of the Guardians is a joy to watch, and the humour comes thick and fast as well. James Gunn has clearly been given free reign to do whatever he wants with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, there's so much crammed in its a little overwhelming at times, but the fun and spectacle of it all is truly breathtaking. It's not all interstellar high jinks though, Gunn puts Star-Lord and Rocket through the emotional wringer. Peter is pining for the loss of his soulmate Gamora who died in Avengers Infinity War, adding insult to injury, he now has to cope with the face she's been replaced by the alternative timeline version of Gamora from Endgame who doesn't love him. Meanwhile, the emotional heart of the film comes from the disturbing flashbacks exploring Rockets origins which highlight the terrible trauma and circumstances that made him into a the kick-ass raccoon we know today. Rocket's origin story is a harrowing and deeply emotional journey to witness as it unfolds, and its is this powerful underlying narrative that really drives the plot.With its frenetic action, amazing special effects, and great soundtrack Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is everything fans could've hoped for and then some. Sure, the plot dose't always quite hold together as well as it could've and the third act drags a little bit, but James Gunn has still managed to skilfully dodge the pitfalls of the threquill to deliver a fitting finale and entertaining intergalactic adventure on the wackier side of the MCU!","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","and_mikkelsen","5 May 2023","After a lot of disapointing Marvel movies I was a bit worried going into this one! I had been let down a couple of times and I felt like this movie just HAD to work! It HAD to be good.. and it was!I love the other Guardians movies and James Gunn manages to wrap up their journey in a meaningfull, emotional and satisfying way! There were a lot of great and relevant themes that really made it a captivating and at times emotional watch! It is rare for a superhero movie to make you think about your life and choices quite like this one!The movie also had its darker moments which i think suited the movie and made it a more mature experience while still making it fun and lighthearted and keeping the overall Guardians charm!James Gunn delivers an unforgetable, thoughtprovoking, emotional last ride with The Guardians that will stick with you!Superhero movies can still be great!","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","boblipton","7 May 2023","It starts with one of those free-for-all battles in which Rocket J. Squirrel.... I mean Raccoon is badly injured. When they try to fix him using high tech, it turns out that they need to get a special computer key, otherwise he'll die. So we alternate between part of his origin story -- although not how he picked up that old-line Bensonhurst accent -- and the various characters in the franchise doing stuff, slanging each other, for 130 minutes. Chukwudi Iwuji is the big villain, who starts off sounding like a high-minded fellow, conducting interesting experiments in eugenics, although by the end we can be sure he'll be just another loon who needs to be shredded into little pieces so that cute little girls can be safe.We also get a sense that this phase of the Guardians is at an end, with several of them going off to do their own things, while Rocket works with a revised team who haven't heard all his wisecracks before. It's a satisfying conclusion to this phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with what my cousin assures me is a good selection of pop music from the 1980s through 2010. For those who care about such things, Nathan Fillion has a nice small role, and his TV daughter from CASTLE, Molly C. Quinn, plays one of the Ravagers.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Pjtaylor-96-138044","14 May 2023","I was expecting - or, should I say, hoping - that 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' would be good, primarily because 'Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014)' is my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie by quite a wide margin and 'Guardians Of The Galaxy: Vol. 2 (2017)' is also great. However, after the solid but not spectacular 'The Guardians Of The Galaxy: Holiday Special (2022)' and the general lacklustre nature of the MCU's fourth phase, I certainly had my doubts. Not that I thought this series finale would be bad, per se, just that I had tempered my expectations and didn't expect it to be something truly special.But, boy, was I wrong. I'm glad to say that 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' puts every single one of Marvel's post-'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' efforts, even the good ones (with the possible exception of 'Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)'), to shame. It positively blows them out of the water and, in fact, it's easily the MCU's best movie since the original 'Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014)'. James Gunn once again proves that character is king, delivering an experience that prioritises emotional growth and interpersonal dynamics over all else. His picture is surprisingly dark from the moment it begins, delving into the traumatic origins of its most interesting character in a number of genuinely upsetting sequences. I'd heard this piece packed an emotional punch and the previous two entries certainly had their tearjerker moments, but my goodness this hit hard. Be sure to bring the tissues because there are a number of moments that may just necessitate their use. It's a truly affecting experience. The excellent characters and their evolving relationships are the bedrock of the affair, which is mature and sincere throughout. Although its tone is relatively downbeat, the series' signature humour is still present. While some of it feels a little out of place, its inclusion is always appreciated. Not only is it often funny, it also signifies that the comedy is a crucial part of the character work; these people can't just turn off their personalities when the going gets tough.Despite its inherent darkness, the feature is still a ton of fun when it needs to be and includes a number of fantastic set-pieces that put a smile on your face. The action is exciting, energetic and expert crafted. There's a one-take sequence in the third act that's absolutely phenomenal, easily one of the - if not the - best action scenes in the entire franchise. The picture also looks great, with vibrant cinematography and a solid mix of practical and visual effects. It never feels like the actors are just standing on a blue/green screen set, even though they clearly often are, and the CGI is actually really convincing, almost like the the effects houses had enough time to properly do their work. Basically, it feels like a real movie, with purposeful shot composition and considered blocking. This really is a miracle given Marvel's reputation for rushing and generally mistreating those doing the legwork in creating their fantasy worlds, which - in combination with some lacklustre cinematography - has resulted in their recent efforts being hampered by some truly awful aesthetics.Another element that enhances Gunn's film is its enthusiastic acting, which is honestly really good across the board. There's no sleepwalking John Krasinski's here, that's for sure. The brilliant writing makes sure that pretty much everyone gets quite a bit to chew on and they all chew it exactly the right amount. Their convincing, often moving work adds believability to each and every moment, no matter how wonderfully outlandish it may. They all strike the perfect balance between humour and heart, reflecting the screenplay's own prowess in that department. This entry is arguably the most sincere in its series. Though the prior entries certainly have genuine heart to them, this one seems to wear it on its sleeve just a little more. Its occasional bluntness doesn't dampen its effect, though, because the piece never feels cheap or manipulative. It seems to honesty believe what it ultimately preaches, building upon the warmth the audience already has towards its key players to deliver a powerful finale that wraps everything up almost perfectly.Although the plotting is a little messy, the flick flows nicely and there's never a dull moment. It's arguably slightly too long, but it makes good use of its runtime and is constantly engaging. The villain is seriously menacing, one of the best antagonists in the MCU not for the complexity of his motivation, but for the vicious single-mindedness of his cruelty. The stakes are arguably the smallest in the series, but that's kind of what makes them the most impactful; for most of the movie, they're entirely personal and focused on the survival of a single character. The narrative goes in somewhat of an unexpected direction, yet remains satisfying throughout by leaning into its unconventional elements and providing a powerful look into events previously only alluded to. It's really compelling overall.In the end, this is an absolutely amazing film. Thanks to its unrivalled character work, effective humour, unflinching darkness, spectacular spectacle, energetic action and impressive aesthetic, it stands head and shoulders above most of the MCU and basically hammers the final nail in the coffin of movies like 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022)' and 'Thor: Love And Thunder (2022)'. This is what happens when you hire a filmmaker and actually let them make the film they want to make. Kevin Feige really should take notes. Emotion and character are the key to good stories; it's a shame Marvel seems to have forgotten that. 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' is honestly one of the best superhero movies ever made. Given its recent disappointments, I didn't think I'd be saying that about an entry in the MCU anytime soon.","9/10"

The way it played with the soundtrack was on another level. You'll notice it's filming techniques are up to date and the cgi had nothing to complain about, no goofy ahh MODOC cgi (quantumania) or scenes that looked like they were filmed on a blank green screen, it truely was a work of cinema and lacked nothing in this way. Although it was your typical villain from the past coming back for revenge, this story was probably the saddest marvel project to date and hit harder than I was expecting.Watch this in the biggest screen you can, completely worth it.","8/10"

In some scenes it was super messed up and weird, but exactly these scenes made the movie so good.I still don't loose hope to see more of the Guardians of the Galaxy, because they are one my favorite heroes in the MCU.The music was also on point again, even tho it didn't reach the music from the previous parts, especially not the tracks from the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, but all in all I loved it!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","burntoutboy","3 May 2023","This was such a breath of fresh air in terms of Marvel films. Like a lot of fans, really felt they were losing their interest and enjoyment but of course Guardians does not disappoint.This is hands down the funniest marvel film, never laughed so much (of course it was silly at times but you'd expect that from a guardians film)
The action sequences were fantastic and the CGI was great (first time in a while for a marvel film). Music was awesome and every character had their scene and whilst I was expecting some emotional scenes based from the trailer, there were a lot more. Villain was very good too and in my opinion the best in the guardians trilogy .The only things I can criticize was the length and one particular character. Other than that this is a brilliant film and conclusion to a trilogy.Edit: upon watching it the 2nd time and in Imax I've changed my rating from a 9 to a 10. My previous negatives I retract, the length is actually fine because the pace and plot suit it. The development of a character that I didn't like, I was wrong about seeing as this time I understood what gunn was doing. This is also the first time I've ever watched a film again in the cinema and man was it worth it!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","mlaps1979","6 May 2023","I'm seeing mostly glowing reviews and I think I may have seen a different movie. This was a loud, annoying, confused movie. It couldn't get out of it's own way. Somehow dark and cutesy at the same time. Adam Warlock was unnecessary to the story and poorly written. Many of the main characters are at death's door on many occasions with no consequences. Multiple fight scenes involving every character so you can't tell what's happening. Drax and Mantis' banter is mostly just obnoxious. They're like kids you just want to smack the whole time. Nebula just yells at everybody for 2 and a half hours. The High Evelutionary is way too over the top to the point where he's mostly just distracting. There were audible groans in the theater when Kraglin sees Yondu during the big battle.There were positives, too. The flashbacks of Rocket were well done and moving. The FX were mostly great. Some of the songs were great songs and fit well in the movie. Some of the banter was funny. There was just way too much.","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","4 May 2023","One of the Guardians is injured, leaving the others only 48 hours to save their life.This does an amazing job capping off an excellent trilogy. James Gunn's work continues to be highly emotionally intelligent, subjecting us to scenes of cruelty not for edgelord humor, which there is still some of, no, to make it a more emotionally engaging and effective story, and to make points about trauma. Nearly every major character has an arc related to the overarching theme that pain begets more pain. If this truly is the last time we see them, at least together, it is a satisfying conclusion.Eugenics and animal testing are confronted head-on and this is a movie that will really hit you hard. The action is creative and visceral, especially the bone breaking, gory parts of it - how did this get a PG-13?! The villain is one we love to hate and we can't wait to see him be taken down. I honestly expected that I would be telling people they have to make sure to watch all the other appearances of this team in preparation, but honestly, if you pay very close attention everything that you need to know to follow it is explained.I recommend this to any fan of movies that are not afraid to get weird, dark and honest. 9/10.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","WatershipBrakey","31 May 2023","It had great reviews from both critics & the public. It has a great director. It has a great cast.But it's not great.Easily the worst GOTG movie and certainly it's a lower tier Marvel movie - I won't watch it again.It's messy, it's basic & it misuses a great cast but it's worst crime is two fold - the music doesn't work & its jokes are old. Two things which made Volumes 1 & 2 stand out are the worst things in Volume 3. I barely raised a chuckle because I'd seen & heard it all before.Yes, it pulls on the heartstrings with it's animal testing plot thread, but it feels out of place & doesn't actually let us into Rocket any deeper than we already were... especially given he's not in the movie very much at all.Unfortunately, this is pretty lame at best.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","a-hilton","8 May 2023","What a dreadful dogs dinner of a movie this was - an hour too long, too much mawkish sentimentality, too many scenes where a character had to explain what was going to happen next, too much miraculous recovery from serious injury, etc. Then towards the end, when we'd been bombarded with an overdose of explosions and killing, pretty much all the characters started shouting at each other.And why so many scenes that seemed to be written for five years olds followed by so many freakish almost nightmarish animal mutations? The film just became ever more ridiculous and stupid to the point where it was just plain irritating.If this is the last one in the Guardian series then it's definitely one too many.","1/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","SereneDawn","7 July 2023","Not suitable for children or individuals who are sensitive.Disney seems to have completely lost sight of its storytelling mastery.The film I had anticipated to be an enjoyable experience turned out to be deeply distressing, as it predominantly depicted instances of animal cruelty. I found myself shedding tears rather than having the anticipated laughter. It is incomprehensible to me why someone with a disturbed mindset would deem it acceptable to repeatedly and explicitly portray such cruelty towards innocent and adorable creatures, subjecting them to painful ordeals or transforming them into grotesque monstrosities. The entirety of the movie was simply disconcerting, and I strongly caution parents and guardians to exercise extreme care if considering allowing their children to watch it. The visuals were disgustingly graphic without any discernible purpose, the narrative lacked inspiration, and this film fails to offer any redeeming qualities. I had initially been filled with excitement about seeing the movie, as the Guardians series is typically enjoyable, but my expectations were shattered, leaving me immensely disappointed.","1/10"

The best character and the best part about this movie is rocket. The flashbacks are very interesting and compelling shows his backstory shows how the villain became how he is in this movie. Each character has moments to shine and it's very well mannered.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","davidwalker-94471","3 May 2023","Guardians is one of my favourite MCU sub-series (after Captain America) and this one lives up to the others.It's a buddy movie, an action movie, a comedy and an origin movie all in one. It's quite an emotional movie and it does feel very final in terms of the guardians we know.There's interesting development of existing characters and introduction, as is the MCU way, of yet more colourful and rich characters that comic fans will know.There's a bit of romantic will-they-won't-they. Actually there's more than a bit.It feels ever so slightly more grown up than the previous two guardians but above all, it's fun and it's a very good entry into the MCU.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TMAuthor23","16 September 2023","If you're reading this you've already invested some time (and emotion) watching the first two.As a conclusion to the original trilogy (there will be more Starlord) it does a pretty good job. The lengthy backstory and character arc for Rocket is great. Gamora's piece is good also. The evolution of Nebula continues with a new look and more sensitive outlook.The one character I didn't enjoy was Adam. If you've read the original Genesis of this character, he was never ""half-baked"" and goofy. He was more like The Silver Surfer, a demigod. Because this version of Adam is so dumb and clumsy, there's little tension in the fight scenes he's involved in except for his first appearance where we don't see him verbally engage with other characters.The weakness in the film is the extended second act. Nathan Fillion is always fun, but the antics in the organic space station go on too long. And as cute as it was, the freeing of all the children at the end felt contrived.Nonetheless, recommended for all of the above and the uplifting ending to a fun story of a band of misfits.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","neil-476","7 May 2023","The Guardians (now including Kraglin, sporting Yondu's spare head fin, but excluding Gamora, now part of the Ravagers) have no sooner set up shop - literally - in Knowhere when disaster strikes in the person of Adam Warlock, a superpowered emissary from the gold people first encountered at the start of volume 2. It turns out that Rocket is being sought by the High Evolutionary, who created him. In the course of what follows, we learn a great deal of Rocket's backstory.The first two Guardians films were cosmic science fiction with jokes, and a strong underlying thread about finding family in the most unlikely places. This third film is a different kettle of fish. It's not without humour, but it is a much darker more serious film than its predecessors. Rocket's backstory does not have the scope for humour that Quill's did.I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I should comment that there are places where it is disturbing, bordering on horrific (not in terms of graphic content).There are things vewers might expect in this film, and I wouldn't wish to spoil any details, other than to say that I'm sure James Gunn was well aware of this and concerned not to disappoint. The details may not be what you expect, though.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","benjaminskylerhill","4 May 2023","The RottenTomatoes critics' consensus laments that this final Guardians outing ""tugs too tight on the heartstrings."" I fail to see how this is a bad thing.Especially when the film's deep emotional core is rooted in a story that carries this trilogy's themes and characters to their natural conclusions. Unlike what Marvel has been churning out recently, nothing about this feels lazy or thrown together.Although this movie's villain isn't as interesting as Vol 2's Ego, he suits this story as he fits the Guardians' collective journey to embrace each others' worth and turn their trauma into an outward-facing tool to help others.James Gunn has also improved as a director, becoming adept with the action scenes; the fights and the peril here have tangible momentum and they're thrilling.It's entertaining, heartfelt, exciting, and beautiful. I adored everything about it.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","subxerogravity","5 May 2023","It was a hell of a ride, and if this is going to be the last of the GOG volumes than it was not a bad last volume. I will not lie; I could not help comparing it to the other volumes and in that comparison, I like the others better, not to say this was not highly thrilling.This volume was funny. It felt like that was the best the movie had to offer overall. Just a lot of fun rich jokes. It was strange if you think about how much it cost in special effects to make this movie and they made a movie where a lot of funny talking is happening. They gave James Gunn a lot of freedom to do some character development to the Guardians. Did we really need that? I'll just say I now see why Dave Bautista was like he did not want to be known as Drax the Destroyer for his overall acting career.The movie did have a lot of really good action scenes spread through the entire film. On one side, this film was all about the Guardians bonding, but despite how intimate that was met to be the movie felt big. Not the biggest Marvel movie I've seen but their efforts were worth seeing on the big screen.And give it up for the High Evolutionary. Don't know much about the character so I can't speak on accuracy but he was evil. I'm glad the Marvel Cinematic universe is getting better with the villains.My only real complaint was the soundtrack. Great songs overall but it did not fit into the story being told like with the other volumes.Overall, it was a good movie as far as movies go, as part of the MCU like other movies (like Ant-Man 3 which came out earlier this year) I feel the magic winding down, but so far this was the best offering for Marvel studios for 2023.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","philwicksteed","8 May 2023","This was pretty disappointing as I loved the first Guardians movie (and enjoyed the second one). It just felt like a bit of a mess, and the acting and dialogue was not as good as the earlier MCU films.Overall it was enjoyable and the 150 minutes passed relatively quickly, but way too much CGI for me and every time I started getting into it, I found myself snapped out of it by a corny line.One of the biggest issues with it is that the ""grown up"" Rocket was largely absent from the movie and instead the character appeared though a highly disturbing yet at the same time saccharine back story.Even the soundtrack seemed all over the place. It includes a couple of real gems (from Faith No More and Beastie Boys in particular) but there didn't seem to be a any time period or genre which linked all the tunes together. Maybe that's the point, but it felt a bit like Quill had left his iPod on shuffle.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cruise01","16 May 2023","5 out of 5 stars.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is an awesome superhero film that is a perfect end to the trilogy with action, emotions, and a great direction arc that concludes to the characters we love.The plot is great. It involves a bit of a backstory to rocket raccoon. And how he came to be. And a story involving the High Evolutionary played by Chukwudi Iwuji who is the villain. The film is big, fast paced, and action packed. It is filled with a bit of a emotional story which can be dark and concluding characters arcs. James Gunn script and direction does know how to handle the pacing, action and emotional story.The visual effects are amazing. The music score and soundtrack is great. Great cast ensemble. Plus new additions like Will Poulter and Chukwudi Iwuji which they deliver. The action sequences are big and exciting.Overall, this third Guardians film delivers it all. And i can not wait to see where it goes next.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","siderite","6 August 2023","What was fun novelty, a combination of Earth American music, wacky characters and impossible odds backed by the special effects from Marvel and a lot of cameos, now feels tired and overstretched. What was fresh and subtle now it's pouring tastelessly on your head. Everything, from the classic music hits, the gags, the action scenes, the special effects, they just come at you from all directions all the time. And it's not really fun. It is just exhausting.I don't know what went wrong, was it the editing? Was it supposed to be a magnum opus of 4 hours or something and then it was cut to shreds? Was is James Gunn going all out with no oversight and no one to tell him he goes overboard? The characters start of as damaged and annoying, frustrated as well as frustrating, only to then change leaf whenever the story needs it to. The slow motion purposeful walking scenes with an oldie but goldie soundtrack doesn't do it anymore and not when it happens again and again and again. The villain jumps from being god-like to a silly little man. The monsters from super powerful to one shot kills. And there are so so so many characters that mean nothing to me.There were some genuinely wonderful scenes in the film, but few and far between. I hope with fresh new ideas, not like the Guardians, James Gunn is going to resurrect Disney, but at the same time I fear its too late, that he's already spent and corrupted by a system that rewards formulaic quantity to any semblance of creative quality. I like the guy's work, but for me this film has been more miss than hit.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","A7medSalah","4 May 2023","A tremendous closure of the MCU's best and most consistent trilogy. Great fun, with insane action and doses of classic Guardians heart & soul! It will leave you emotionally shattered, but filled with so much hope and optimism.First, The MVP of the movie and i will not be even exaggerating when i say the whole trilogy, Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the emotional core of this one, so much time is spent exploring his past and it leads to the most emotionally devastating moments and he absolutely brings it.Chris Pratt is just as strong as before as Peter Quill, there's always been a sadness beneath the charming exterior but after all the previous losses its starting to come to the surface in terrific fashion as he's determined to protect his family this time around.Chukwudi Iwuji is an amazing villain, eschewing the usual tortured past of most villains for a character who is just plain evil and larger than life, played to perfection.Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff remain really funny throughout but the film wisely still takes time to offer reminders of their dramatic chops as well.Groot is just Groot that we love i will not say anything more.I think Will Poulter's Adam Warlock was a mixed bag at best. Though I liked how seriously Poulter played the character, there weren't really enough parts in the film that let him to stand out too much Nevertheless, Im excited to see him in the future.Cosmo is a New addition to the family and what a Great one i loved it so much can't wait for the character future because Cosmo is great in the comics. On the other hand Nebula arc is one of the best arcs in MCU history that is all I'm going to say.John Murphy Music shares more stylistically with The Suicide Squad opposed to Tyler Bates work but it still remembers to use that iconic theme at the right moment and Awesome Mix - Vol 3 is excellent. No longer focusing on a single decade it creates something much more unique.Finally, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 may be an uneven film at times, but it remains touching and endearing, with a fascinating study of its characters. Overall, it's a fitting and satisfying conclusion to one of Marvel's most beloved franchises.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","FeastMode","5 May 2023","This third chapter in the Guardians series feels like it has a new style of its own while keeping the essence of the previous ones. It's a much more serious tone which I really enjoyed.Like with the last two MCU movies, they dial back the comedy and do a better job of placing it strategically. The jokes feel organic as opposed to the ""insert joke here"" style. And they never take away from a serious moment. And man are there some serious moments.This movie is emotionally powerful. I felt such a range of emotions and they all hit hard. They take their time with the scenes and allow you to simmer in that moment. And the beautiful music magnifies all of this.The arguments between characters are all compelling. I like the added focus on mantis after seeing Pom's performance in the Holiday Special. And I'm so glad they pushed the PG-13 rating pretty far. I would love to continue seeing darker elements explored without holding back as much.I've never been part of the MCU fatigue crowd because I don't fatigue from fun entertainment. But I was a little nervous after two of the last three movies were near the bottom of my rankings (Thor 4 and Ant-Man 3). But with Guardians 3, hope is restored that they can bounce back if they falter.And it seems like they're listening to feedback. This feels more like giving the reigns to the director and allowing him to put his own stamp on it. It feels like its own movie rather than another template movie. And they fixed the comedy. This is how comedy should be incorporated into the movie, the exact opposite example of Thor 4.(2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 5/4/2023, IMAX 5/16/2023)","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","tareqzaghal","3 September 2023","Gunn's farewell to these characters and universe accomplishes everything it aimed for amidst the mediocrity of the MCU post-Endgame. It's clear that there is passion behind this work, there is love for these characters, and there is a desire to do their stories just and set them off in the most caring way possible.Every character gets their moment to shine and is provided a satisfying arc conclusion, you believe these relationships because Gunn has been able to guide the audience throughout his trilogy to fully care for how things might turn out for the Guardians. The action is highly kinetic and energetic, I loved how he fully utilised the IMAX scenes with incredible use of scope. The hallway scene is undeniably a highlight as well. Bright and colourful, the set design stands out as probably the most creative of the MCU by far, especially the sequence at the OrgoCorp headquarters.The story develops in a very organic way, even if it focuses on Rocket for the majority of it, it still feels balanced despite feeling like there were too many flashbacks during the first watch. The High Evolutionary's performances was better this time too. The Counter-Earth segment is still creepy, weird stuff o look at. A bit too long, but it has to accomplish a lot, Gunn has to deal with consequences from previous instalments and other projects that affect his characters. Everything with how Gamora and Quill's relationship was really well handled and interwoven, but as for Adam Warlock, not so much.I've grown accustomed to the regular ""Gunn-isms"" that are present in each of his films, but Vol.3 shines as an example of how important passion is, especially when making a comic book blockbuster, without it, many like the failures being released nowadays, won't stand the test of time, but this has a strong chance of doing so.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","mihaigreeny","9 May 2023","Another fail from Marvel! It seems Marvel has declined from the moment Disney took control over MCU.The movie want to be a little bit darker but the same cringe humor formula still exist and it's atrocious! The acting from everyone is mediocre. They introduce us to High Evolutionary but he is weak. They give us Adam Warlock in early stages but as well, he seems awfully created!80% of the movie is about a talking racoon and his so called: origins. Drax acting like a silly child. The special effects are awful. And again: even they tried to make this movie a little bit more darker, the ""jokes every 5 minutes"" are there and the jokes are cheesy and cringe! I have a bad feeling for DCEU under the lead of James Gunn.","2/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ScorpioDog","7 January 2024","'Guardians of the Galaxy 3' was a great conclusion for this lovable cast of characters.The exploration of Rocket's backstory was the most intriguing part of the narrative. It was extremely emotional and quite hard to watch at points due to the tough depiction of animal abuse. I am glad we got to see this backstory depicted on screen! There is a particular narrative choice with one character that I am glad they chose to do and did not follow the clich√© certain films have already done.One action scene towards the end of the film was so well executed and extreme. It was a blast to watch! Plus, the music always works so well in these films.However, some of the comedy did fall a little flat at points. It does not linger too much on them though and there were just as many comedy moments that did work. Guardians of the Galaxy fans need to see this film!","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","darkman4801789","4 May 2023","This movie is my favorite of the 3 guardians movies. I went to a media screening the day before the wide release and it had everyone in the theater clapping and crying by the end of it. It really starts off fast and never lets up from there. They mix in drama and comedy masterfully and really set up the future of the franchise. There are parts that are difficult to watch if you are an animal lover. The exciting addition of adam warlock to the franchise opens up a lot of new possibilities for the future. The high evolutionary is one of the most brutal villains in any marvel movie! There are 2 post credit scenes!","10/10"

Content of this episode of Guardians was vast still it was compacted well and delivered methodically. Interesting message on deciding what's sacrificial to an audience that exists in a world rapidly mechanizing. Light hearted interactions has been a remarkable quality of guardians series. First class visual effects as always. Great performances by the cast while so much of the story dependent on CGI.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TheDanishMovie-Nerd","3 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is a remarkable achievement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Director James Gunn has delivered a movie that is colorful, emotional, and a feast for the senses. It is a movie that might just be some of the MCU's finest work to date.The emotions in this film run high, and I was moved to tears at least five times during the course of the movie. The film explores the tragic backstory of Rocket Raccoon through effective use of flashbacks, which adds a layer of emotional depth to the character. This is a movie that is not afraid to be vulnerable, and it is all the better for it.Every single character gets their moment to shine in this film, and it is a testament to James Gunn's skill as a writer and director that he manages to balance all of the characters so well. There are plenty of moments of levity and humor, but there are also moments of heartbreak and tragedy. The film manages to strike a perfect balance between these different elements, which is no mean feat.The music in this film is as great as always, and the soundtrack is a highlight. James Gunn has a real knack for choosing the perfect songs for his movies, and the songs in this film are no exception. The visuals in this film are also stunning, and the movie is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and thrilling to watch, and the special effects are top-notch.I have no negative thoughts on this movie. It is a movie that had me emotionally engaged from start to finish, and it has been a long time since the MCU made me feel like this. This might just crack my personal top 5 MCU movies, and it is a movie that I will be thinking about for a long time to come.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is a colorful, emotional masterpiece that is a must-see for Marvel fans and moviegoers alike. James Gunn has crafted a film that is both visually stunning and emotionally engaging, and it is a testament to the power of storytelling. The film is an incredible achievement and one that I cannot recommend enough.","10/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Shiryu05","21 August 2023","Animal experimentation (vivisection) in a way that should get most, if not all people to understand how cruel and inhumane our actions are.Yes, the film has plenty of laughs and we're delighted to see so many familiar faces, but viewers should hopefully take the animal experimentation scenes and understand what it means in real life - this happens every day to millions of animals around the world for the creation of cosmetics, medicine etc. It is unacceptable that we continue to pretend it doesn't exist when we are the only reason why it exists.Guardians 3 is a wonderful movie with hidden depths.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","darkreignn","7 May 2023","""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3"" is, no doubt, a quality film. From the subdued and subtle opening to the more bombastic and high-octane action set-pieces, writer and director James Gunn knows how to put his own unique stamp on the tired genre of super hero films - so much so that ""Guardians 3"" doesn't even feel like a super hero movie, and that's a good thing. More of a somber drama than the whimsical space-adventure of the previous two films, this third, and seemingly final, entry plays things very straight, telling an emotional story that may have you fighting back tears. Gunn has a clear care for both the source material and the story he's trying to tell, and it's evident; this is, without a doubt, a James Gunn movie through and through. The problem with that, for me, is that - and I mean this with the utmost respect - James Gunn is a fan of the bizarre and macabre, and I feel as if ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3"" was just a bit too bizarre and macabre for my taste.I saw this movie twice in order to best solidify my thoughts on it because, after my first viewing, I honestly left the theatre confused; and honestly, even after second viewing I still find myself conflicted. On one hand, the movie works as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, filled with emotion and beautiful characterization, with themes of family and friendship ringing true throughout the entire running time. Additionally, the action, the CGI, it all looks stunning, all of it elevated by the story's dramatic heft; not since Endgame has an MCU film been this emotionally resonant. I also don't even need to mention the soundtrack, because you already know it's going to be amazing, and it is - I was tapping my foot constantly throughout the film. On the other hand, however, despite all of the good this movie contains, I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed watching it because, well, I really didn't.While ""Guardians 3"" stands out from the MCU pack, it does so to the detriment of my personal viewing experience. To put it frankly, I found this movie disturbing. Without specific spoilers, the movie deals heavily with animal cruelty, a theme that I didn't necessarily realize I had a problem with until I watched this movie and was privy to Frankenstein-esque animals that look more like something out of a horror film than they do a kids super hero movie. And it's not so much their appearance that's the problem, but rather the mental images that will flicker in your mind as you imagine what said animals had to go through to look the way they do. The film is surprisingly graphic, and I can imagine many children leaving the theatre traumatized based on this aspect alone - hell, I'm an adult, and I found myself feeling queasy and disgusted, with the images sticking with me long after the credits rolled.So, it'll be up to you if the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3."" Maybe you'll find yourself uplifted by the undeniable positivity the movie does have, or maybe the tone is a fitting change of pace for you when compared to recent super hero films. While I am looking forward to seeing this film again strictly for its soundtrack (it really is that good), ultimately the depictions of animal cruelty proved to be too disturbing for me to fully enjoy the film.","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Avwillfan89","7 May 2023","This was a lot to take in!Although the Guardians films have always had a great mix of both dark and goofy, funny moments, this one takes it on much more serious level, with themes and scenes of animal torture/mutilation/experimentation, eugenics, and genocide.Rocket's backstory and how he became what he is today (both physically and psychologically) is absolutely heartbreaking, and is definitely the strongest parts of the story.The High Evolutionary is probably one of the nastiest, evil villains Marvel has yet produced, making Thanos look almost benevolent. Chukwudi Iwuji plays him like a Shakespearean villain, and in successfully terrifying manner.Despite some storylines being underdeveloped, unexplored or left out entirely, this is a welcome breath of fresh air after the utter atrocity that was Quantumania. Although it won't be enough to save the MCU from its steak of mediocre films, it's a good start.And Rocket truly deserves all the happiness in the world after all he's been through.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","paul_haakonsen","7 July 2023","Of the entire catalogue of Marvel superhero movies thus far, I have to admit that the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies have been among some of the better for me, as they are the most colorful and have the most interesting characters.While I am not much of a superhero fan in general, I do sit down to watch these Marvel movies because they are rather nicely made. Thus, I also opted to sit down and watch the 2023 movie ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". And I have to admit that I am very glad that I did, because ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" turned out to be really enjoyable. And it was without a doubt, the best of the three movies in the franchise.The storyline in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", as written by writer and director James Gunn, just felt very wholesome, and it brought a lot of nice details to the various characters. I especially enjoyed the entire focus point on Rocket and his backstory; that one really added so many layers to the character and it was rather nicely written.Running at 150 minutes, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" doesn't feel like a long movie, because director James Gunn manages to keep the pacing going at full throttle throughout the entire movie. Thumbs up on that accomplishment.It is always nice to see returning cast on the screen reprising their characters, and that was definitely the issue in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". A good cast ensemble returned to the screen, and that was applicable to both the main cast, but also for support cast in small roles. That adds a good sense of continuity to the storyline.Visually, then you know that Marvel goes all in, guns blazing. And they also did that in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", oh boy did they ever! The CGI effects in the movie are through the roof, and that adds a lot of feel and flavor to bringing the universe in which the movie takes place to life. Lots of attention to detail. The props, wardrobe and make-up departments also worked very nicely here.If you enjoy Marvel movies, then ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a movie that is well-worth sitting down and spending 150 minutes on watching.My rating of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.","8/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Kingslaay","5 June 2023","Alright I will be bucking the trend here but as someone who loves films I want to honestly share my views on here. I am surprised by the high reviews and ratings on here. I was left somewhat disappointed with this film. It felt all over the place. The strong points was Rocket's origin story and the somewhat dark and serious nature of the film. But a lot of the film was unnecessary noise that added little to no value. The main villain and their motivation is poorly explained and illustrated. You needed to say more and explain 'why' he is doing what he's doing. We had a whole bunch of children randomly feature in the film and Gamora has returned after being killed off in the Avengers film but with little to no explanation as to how and why she's different. Also despite being a darker film, a key feature of Marvel films has been its great humour. This film has very small doses of it that do not help balance the film and sustain it.Sadly Volume 3 is a far cry from its two predecessors. What made Guardians of the Galaxy great was its quirky nature, over the top characters, humour and great soundtrack. The soundtrack featured forgettable and B side 80s tracks. It's a shame the send off for the Guardians was not on a high note.","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","vandykeu","6 August 2023","I'm not a comic fan, and have never really gotten into the medium at all. I'm definitely one of those who enjoyed the MCU up to Endgame but has had major superhero fatigue for a while now. I watch most of the Marvel films because they are good cheap thrills, but... it is getting pretty stale.Guardians 3 though, doesn't really feel like a Marvel film. The whole trilogy is clearly a part of Marvel, but it feels more like a space-opera. More like Star Wars, or Firefly, or something like that. James Gunn has done a wonderful job of building characters, storylines, and a world here, and in third film he goes even further.One of the things I really like about this film is how it shows the consequences of past stories. Marvel has taken these characters on some major emotional rides since Infinity War, and Gunn is not afraid to show us how the characters have been affected, and how they have grown. I really like how each of the 'team' gets their own closure in their own way. Likewise, here, he delves into Rocket's backstory, which is one of the saddest things I've ever seen. This film has emotional impact far beyond a typical Marvel movie, and it is one of the best as a result.The only critique I have is that the villain is a bit over the top. I at first would call him a Mengele, but Mengele was too banal for this. The villain here knows what he is doing and revels in it. On one hand, this is a good step away from Marvel humanizing many of its villains (even disagreeing with Thanos, for example, you can kind of see his point). Here, the villain has no redeeming qualities, but as a result is a bit too purely evil. It works, and you certainly root for Rocket to get his revenge, but it is the weak link of the film.I don't have high hopes for where Marvel is going in terms of a broader story, and I kind of think they should have quit while ahead with Endgame. It has felt like most of the following films have been moneygrabs. But, this one stands up, and is worthwhile.","9/10"

Surely, Guardians would be the shining light amidst the darkness. A brilliant cast with brilliant chemistry couldn't possibly go wrong. Wow. How wrong we were. The darkness, the unending anger across the board, even from the softer souls in 1&2. Child abduction, vivid animal cruelty, and two key characters omitted or morphed in such a way that the rest of the cast delivered banter with juddering effect. Heartbroken. Hopefully, like Star Wars, we will get a true, uplifting Finale2. The Guardians deserve it, and so do we.","2/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jordanhulett1996","6 May 2023","I've been a long-time fan of James Gunn, I always found that Guardians of The Galaxy was one of the better Marvel series, but with each film, I find that the quality goes down and down. This third film is no exception. There are some really strong moments but ultimately this film is the least funny, out of the trilogy, fails at being effectively serious, and feels more like an in-between film rather than a conclusive end to a trilogy. We learn more about Rocket's backstory, things we already knew, and the characters are set up for future films/Shows. That's all you get from the film. It Sucks.","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","KFstudios2009","24 August 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the third installment and the final movie in the trilogy. I haven't seen the previous movies, but it wasn't much you got to understand from the previous, what was good about it. Great space adventure, that shows us the moral of that you should not harm people and animals, and that teamwork and friendship is important. This time we got more flashback from Rockets past, Rocket The Raccoon was a experiment for the perfect society, but the villain didn't want to make things perfect, he just hated the things the way the were. Rockets flashbacks and experiments was heartbreaking and very emotional moments, that almost made me cry. His friends, the other Guardians, tried to save him in this movie, because Rocket was about to die, and his flashbacks come. The movie were great directed by James Gunn. They made a generic plot in an interesting way. Funny dialogues, sometimes confusing, but that is what made it funny. Great visuals and scenography, and I really got the space adventure feeling. Beside of Rocket, I liked some of the other characters, like Peter Quill, played by Chris Pratt, he was funny and you could almost think that he really was a guardian. Cosmo the space dog was funny, not so important but made the movie. I think if Cosmo wasn't included, I would give this movie 7/10, not 8/10. Groot don't speak too much, and he is not the best character, but acceptable. When Guardians travelled between the planets, it flows really smooth and the planets were very detailed so you got a lot of information from each planet, what made me understand more of the planet's perspective and the people that lived there. I think they presented the moral of friendship and family in the movie. From Rockets flashbacks we can learn that harming others is bad, and that freedom is important. You can learn a lot, a movie full of moral and value. If you like Marvel movies, then you should watch it. If you like space adventures and funny dogs, this movie is highly recommended. Well done, James Gunn did a good job, one of the best Marvel movies of the year, much better than Ant-Man in Quantamania.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","christianyogendran-15663","15 September 2023","Wow just wow...Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is extremely well done. Once again, James Gunn delivers a masterpiece here, Adam Warlock is finally in the MCU, and we finally get the backstory of Rocket, which was something we all were looking for.The one thing I gotta say is, everything is so well done here, but we finally a simple villain. Lately all Marvel villains have found ways to redeem themselves, something that I really don't like at all. Thankfully we didn't get that here. Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary should be winning an Oscar for this performance alone, his acting is off the charts in this movie. No redemption necessary, just simply evil.Rocket's backstory is another highlight of this movie. For the past two movies he was just there. This movie, he gets a bigger role and I really love Bradley Cooper's acting here as much as Chukwudi Iwuji's.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","yahaira-729-694701","3 October 2023","One of the best productions coming out of Marvel studios. The writing on this volume 3 brought home the theme of animal experimentation which is the true story is about Rockets origin and his creators. Rocket became who he was because of the lord that made him as a reflection of his quest for a perfect universe. But like all despots that weild power things tend to backfire. The visuals and special effects are great at times though the action space was disorienting were they on a ship or some planet their home base. This one was an action drama to my view point then the previous 2 volumes. I did cry throgh parts of it there is no mercy for animal brutality. Cheers to the outstanding cast and writers.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","akshatmahajan","5 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 was a beautiful farewell to the GotG trilogy. It was a proper Marvel movie we got to see in recent years. The movie had more emotional tone and all the characters had more depth in this concluding part. Rocket's backstory was also good and emotional and it moves you. The songs prevent the story from becoming boring. The story was engaging and even after having long runtime and uneven pacing, the story doesn't fail to entertain you. The climax was also nice and it makes you emotional as it feels like end of something beautiful. Overall, James Gunn delivered a beautiful Marvel movie.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","MxS7HGS","14 December 2023","The rollercoaster ride that is James Gunn's direction in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 left me both laughing and crying, and then crying even harder. I have a love-hate relationship with it, but I cannot deny the excellent needle drops, signature humor, and action that we have come to expect from a Gunn film.However, the film falls prey to the usual MCU plunders and feels stuck in a tug-of-war between Gunn and Marvel. The sheer number of characters makes it messy and difficult to find harmony in its multiple swan songs.Despite this, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 works extremely well at its core, with a surprisingly interesting villain and a truly moving goodbye that most fans of the Guardians will love and appreciate. I will surely miss these weirdos.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sallywyatt","24 May 2023","Loved the first 2 guardians movies and was so looking forward to 3. Don't know what happened but this one was a big let down. Where is the great writing & humor? Sure wasn't in this movie. And the music, it was part of what made the movies so good, not anymore. While not horrible the movie dragged and was kind of boring. Left the theatre thinking I could of cared less if I had seen it or not. Rewatch the first two many times but have no desire to watch this one again. Gone is the good feeling you get watching the first two. And the ending? Won't give any details but it was also very disappointing.","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Floated2","4 August 2023","After nearly a six year hiatus from the previous instalment of Guardians of the Galaxy, this third and possibly last film of the franchise takes things to several new heights. The visuals are arguably better than ever and the story is very interesting and keeps everything well balanced with the assortment of characters.The second film was solid but a slight downgrade from the surprise original. Now this third film feels a little more and expands great upon the previous two. With a longer runtime, there is more room for growth and more screen time for secondary characters.What is impressive is how the film incorporates different genres blending from action to adventure, comedy, drama with silly, funny then heartfelt and quite sad moments. Raccoon definitely steals the show, along with a talking dog Cosmo. Nebula and Mantis also have bigger roles which is great. Gamora was reduced noticeably. Overall very great film and better than initially expected.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","danieljfarthing","30 July 2023","""Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2"" rocked, so it's no shock that ""Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 3"" also bangs - again building bright blockbuster fun on deeper themes of friendship & family. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn and the voices of Bradley Cooper & Vin Diesel return as the titular inter-stellar comrades this time fighting Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter & others to save Cooper's life. There are cameos too from Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Fairbank and Linda Cardellini & Judy Greer (voices) - with all performances being great The REAL star tho is director & writer James Gunn (Sean's bro) - who was excellent again.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","BA_Harrison","3 May 2023","I'm not the biggest fan of GOTG, but I've got one of those Unlimited cards, so seeing the third film didn't cost me any extra. Volume 3 hasn't changed my opinion of the series - it's another loud, flashy, action-packed explosion of CGI, with a catchy soundtrack and lots of the same brand of humour that hasn't worked for me in either of the previous films, and it left me rather bored at times.At two hours and thirty minutes, it really is way too long for this kind of popcorn nonsense: director James Gunn lets scenes go on and on and on, resulting in a movie more bloated than Starlord's face when he sucks on the vacuum of space. I reckon I would have liked the film more had they trimmed a good half-an-hour to forty-five minutes (virtually every scene could do with tightening). When Gunn is on form - most notably, the visually breathtaking Beastie Boys-backed fight scene and Rocket rescuing the baby raccoons (very touching) - the film works well, but there are too many moments that drag, often as a result of the lame comedy (Drax reclining on the sofa THREE times, Mantis repeatedly landing clumsily).In my opinion, the best thing about the film is its soundtrack - Alice Cooper, Rainbow, Faith No More, The Beastie Boys and The Flaming Lips!5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","GomezAddams666","5 May 2023","It's safe to say the Guardians of the Galaxy were a pretty obscure property before their film debut, it is also fair to say that nowadays they are embedded into the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a way that you know what to expect from them.This entry is everything a fan of the dysfunctional group would want, a space opera with lots of action, humor and intense stupidity from the main heroes, but we were also warned this time there was going to be an emotional component attached to Rocket's backstory, and they delivered on that promise.In the first movie we learned that Rocket was a science experiment, but we get to learn the identity of the mad scientist here, a highly sadistic and intelligent being named High Evolutionary.Chukwudi Iwuji plays High Evolutionary like a Shakespearean villain, he is a truly terrifying antagonist who transforms living beings into different versions of themselves, he does not want to conquer the universe, merely just transform its inhabitants enough to proclaim himself a god. By the end of the film you will come to hate this character with a burning passion.Marvel has always being criticized for its villains, but it is my unmovable opinion that not only is most of the criticism unfounded, but also this trilogy has amazing villains, with one very notable exception.Will Poulter joins the cast as the ever-powerful Adam Warlock, in the comics he is one of the most formidable beings in the universe, and when this movie introduces him we get to see the extent of his might as he neutralizes the Guardians almost without breaking a sweat, and if the rest of the story had continued in that direction, the film would have been perfect, but unfortunately it did not.The rest of this entry turns Adam into an immature character, a child that didn't completely grow inside the cocoon he was made in, they turned him almost into the comic relief.We have been waiting for Adam Warlock since he was teased in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and it was a huge disappointment. Will Poulter did everything he could with the character, but it seems the filmmakers did not know what to do witch such a powerful being, which is shameful.Overall the movie is very enjoyable with a few problems that unfortunately stand out enough to be noticed. But if this is the last time we see the complete line-up of the Guardians, I can safely say they had a pretty good run.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","med77_99","8 May 2023","They say, if you've seen one Marvel movie, then you've seen them all.Guardians Vol 3 adds absolutely nothing new to the superhero genre, it's dull and quite predictable from start to finish, albeit I walked out possibly 30 minutes before it ended.The plot centers around Rocket, his origins and past. I found the whole story very dull for an adult, perhaps, kids between the ages of 4 and 8 could find it amusing. His past involving brotherly love to other animals being experimented on by an evil warlord was forced and dull.So much melodrama added, they tried making us emotionally connected to the animals, which I didn't feel, i thought they were childish cartoon characters with no background or developed characters. The scene were they chose their names was supposed to be the high point where we identify with them and connect, for me, zero connection.They then added a somewhat violent scene that enraged Rocket, probably for kids, its frightening, for adults was over dramatic.The whole animal unite theme seemed forced.Seemed like a movie called Cats and Dogs or G force.They also tried to build other characters that i felt absolutely no connection with, namely the mohawk telepathy guy and the talking dog.Some humorous scenes were actually funny but only a few. Special effects no longer matter after the hundreds of movies out there using CGI. Action was lame and because of the lack of stakes, there is no tension invested in the scene.The villain is possibly the worst i've ever seen, one dimensional angry lord who doesn't like to be questioned, formulatic and copy paste from Disney villains.For the first time ever, I walked out of a Marvel movie before it ended, i just couldn't tolerate the cringing script and dialogue, the excessive melodrama, the childish scenes and how predictable it was.And yeah, they had to find a group of lost kids who were so annoying but required saving and hurray !!! We are all happy ,,add to that the long run time and i just couldn't sit through it all.For some reasons, the writers and directors thought cute animals and kids will automatically trigger emotions in viewers, which i did not feel whatsoever.Do yourselves a favor and skip this.","1/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","chrisklugh","17 September 2023","Who would have thought Marvel could come out with a watery eyed gem! Advised to maybe watch by yourself so you can feel the story!Guardians of the Galaxy is easily my favorite story line in the Marvel universe.Volume 1 had everyone angry and pitted against each other due to each of their own respective painful back stories. But came out as a team. Solid. Volume 2 was what you'd expect. The team doing their thing. Good movie. But expected. But Volume 3...What can I say about Volume 3 other then it insured the deeper meaning of friendship. The meaning of shared circumstances that unites us. If nothing else, we are all the same when we've gone down the same road. Empathy. You can't fake it. You can't fake the bond between friends that have been though the thick of it together.But Volume 4? Where is it going to go from here? With the bar set so high, well... I hope to find out. But only if they get it right. I will remain patience and enjoy the first 3 Volumes in the mean time!","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","drawlife","6 May 2023","Let me just say that I think GUARDIANS VOL. 1 is one of the MCU's gem and in the MCU's Top 10. It ranks within the higher tier films like the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA sequels, INFINITY WAR and the first AVENGERS. It felt like STAR WARS without it being STAR WARS as Gunn eloquently put it. I thought VOL. 2 was a massive ""recycled"" step backwards with an overload of humor. Yondu is the only thing worthy about VOL.2So I walked into this one with some low expectations due to how I felt about VOL. 2 and the quality of MCU films as of late. While it is a step above VOL. 2, I did feel like the film yanked along the way with so many moments that just tried way too hard to make me feel emotional.This is probably a me thing, but because I'm not particularly an animal lover, I felt Rocket's backstory tried too hard to make me feel sad. It did provide a lot of depth for him and Bradley Cooper does a great job voicing him. I would argue this is probably is his best outing as Rocket so far.In contrast though, respect to Gunn for including animal cruelty and child abduction. I loved that he went there and played around in that dark arena. I absolutely respect the move because I love when the MCU makes an effort to include mature themes and dark elements from time to time. Humor was more tame compared to VOL. 2 and I didn't particularly mind it this time around. Some of the jokes landed and I did find myself chuckling once or twice.Pratt's Star-Lord feels more evolved and not the same go-lucky/quipping thief, and of course he wouldn't as he's mourning the loss of his girlfriend, but there is another version of her that isn't the version he fell in love with. Another move I respect was that he and Gamora did not get back together. It felt real and made bigger impact mirroring the fact that this iteration of the Guardians is finished. Saldana does a good job playing Gamora a bit more savage and merciless.Bautista has good chemistry with Klementieff as shown in the Holiday Special and I'm happy Bautista got more action sequences showcasing Drax's strength. Groot is used to good effect as well. Not as awesome as the first Groot but way better than baby/teenage Groot. Kraglin played by Gunn's brother Sean and Cosmo voiced by Maria Bakalova are also involved in a meaningful way. Again kudos to James Gunn for this juggling act.Will Poulter's Adam Warlock I felt got the short end of the stick. I thought he could have been utilized a little bit better, but I did quite like his portrayal. As for Chukwudi Iwuji, he does a great job being unhinged as the High Evolutionary. Very threatening, menacing and just all out crazy.I did feel the length. I felt the whole part at Orgoscope was unnecessary and dragged the film. I felt they could have just went straight to the High Evolutionary. Again, while the flashbacks provided some depth for Rocket, it felt choppy to me primarily because I'm trying to engage with the overall plot in motion and then I'm watching something where I felt tried too hard to make me care. Rocket in ""animal heaven"" reunited with his friends also felt extremely cheesy. Another example of that was when the film plays with the idea of Star-Lord dying at the end. What bothered me about that was how does he not have his helmet and his jetpack on his ankles that he's known for having? He's flown in space before and yeah I know he was asked to not have weapons in the High Evolutionary's HQ, but he gave his blasters to Groot who hid a bunch of guns, he couldn't have given him his ankle jetpacks or his helmet? This is why I felt like the film is deliberately trying to make me feel emotional.Also this is a minor, comic-book geek nitpick that doesn't really effect the film, but the visual development team gave them the classic comic-book accurate blue and red striped suits and they couldn't give Star-Lord his mask with the accurate helmet from the comics? LOL.Anyways, I respected the darker themes, I respected that if felt like the end with a whole new team assembled and there were some fine performances, but it felt long and wasn't particularly subtle at tugging my heart strings.5/10.","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","HafizhMaulana21","9 October 2023","The final journey and mission of the Guardians in their adventures in the universe. For this time, Peter Quill and his team must face enemies from Rocket Racoon's past who want to reclaim Rocket Racoon. The success of their mission depends on the Guardians, otherwise it will be the end for the Guardians.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is an epic conclusion to the adventure story of the Guardians in the universe. The parting story is quite moving and heartwarming to see their departure as Guardians. GotG vol.3 still provides its own experience watching the Guardians with colorful visuals, old songs that are still a mainstay and humors that are still funny and entertaining. However, GotG vol.3 brings something that for me is so deep. Bringing to a glimpse of Rocket Racoon's past which turns out to make us sad and concerned. The friendship scene between Theefs, Floor, Rocket and of course Lyla brings us a moving atmosphere and a strong feeling of friendship between them. It can be said that this third series brings a much deeper element to see the sadness of Rocket Racoon's past. Rocket's past makes us stunned by how experiments on animals are so cruel and not so good. Overall, GotG vol.3 is the conclusion of a slick and extraordinary Guardians story. The new cast, Chukwudi Iwuji and Will Poulter, become new characters who make a good impression with a slick performance. Chukwudi who played The High Revolutionary became the most memorable character as a villain. The character is just right, appears aggressively, and is able to give the impression of a villain who is really evil and threatening. Likewise with Will Poulter as Adam Warlock which for me is very perfect. The appearance is fairly new but able to bring a positive impression to fans. Of course, it is very sad to see the members of the Guardians who are starting to live their new stories and scatter each other. Meanwhile, now the Guardians have a new member to look forward to.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","kuner-59029","6 May 2023","It goes to show what kind of pull James Gunn has, when he got Disney to greenlight a movie, where there's a gory closeup of someone's skinned, bleeding face, after their face was just torn off. There's also a lot of animal torture and other really grim stuff.Most of the violence remains inconsequential, especially the many teased or hinted deaths of main characters, complete with sad music as they are beaten half to death, frozen, shot through the heart or decapitated, only to be fine again a moment later.And so, without any real consequences or emotional stakes, the cruelty on screen is little more than torture porn.On one hand, I would generally applaud Disney for their audacity, if the violence and misery served a purpose. It doesn't. The emotional payoffs aren't there, and the film leaves you feeling manipulated and cheated. Where Rian Johnson attempts to subvert audience's expecations, Gunn subverts their emotions. Neither seem to regard their audiences as anything other than lab rats.However, Gunn isn't without talent, and there are several beautiful shot compositions, some clever writing and a few instances of well used music. Gunn even at his worst and most self-indulgent is still more interesting than the usual MCU conveyer belt slop. Any 5 minutes of GotG3 has more humor and heart than the entirety of Thor Love and Thunder or Eternals.It's a shame. James Gunn is undoubtedly talented, but he is too full of himself to temper himself when story demands it, and there's something really misanthropic and sadistic about him, that just seeps into his movies. He trivializes suffering and cruelty in a way that is indicative of a psychopathic mind, like someone who would watch Schindler's List and make scat jokes about the boys hiding in the toilet.I can separate the artist from the art, however, and maintain that the first GotG1 is one of the best MCU movies to date (if not the best). This third one, however, left me feeling dirty, like after that Terrifier movie.If you liked the Saw or Hostel movies, chances are you'll like this. Everyone else may want to skip this latest death throe of the MCU.","2/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","olcare","10 May 2023","First of all, I should say that this review will be quite long (for those who feel lazy, they should check out the note section at the end but it inclouds spoilers). I hope someone reads it and shares the same intensity as me, maybe someone has already shared it. I have been a Marvel fan for a long time, and I can easily say that this movie is good, but it is also sad that it took me 3 days to post this review, and I am really overwhelmed right now, let me start.First of all, I want to talk about the team and harmony. I cannot list the actors one by one, nor the technical team, but I can easily say that everything was good, even though it sometimes tended to be too clich√©, I think the script was not bad; it was even much better than the last 7-8 Marvel movies. I thank James Gunn for making me feel these emotions and for writing a good ending for the original team.Let me explain my favorite part, Rocket... The story of Rocket was well-incorporated into the plot and the script, and it was extremely critical for a superhero movie. I think it was also very strong and special because it contained animal rights references with the backstory of our character who suffered torture, and it made me feel very emotional, especially when he became the leader of the new team just like in the comics.If we look at the overall movie, there are 2-3 plot errors, but they blended 2 storylines very well. Additionally, the action scenes were quite good, and although I read a lot of comments stating that there was not enough action in some parts, I disagree; the action was appropriate. Although Gamora's story did not satisfy me much, I don't think it was bad either. However, I think the stories of Drax, Groot, Mantis, and Nebula were quite normal and good, and the idea of not killing anyone in the team was also good; it was appropriate for them to lead a normal life. I do not know if the new team will make us feel as emotional as the old team, but it is definitely exciting.My disappointments were the portrayal of Adam Warlock and our villain, High Evolutionary. Although the motivation of our villain was good, due to some bad screenplay choices, he did not fit perfectly as the clearest and well-intentioned villain of Marvel in recent times. (I would like to add a little note here: there was a bit too much over-acting sometimes, which bothered me.) Adam Warlock was a huge disappointment; they shaved off many parts of the character by taking him out of the cocoon early, while he was supposed to be a much more serious and harsh character, I hope his character development will be much better. Because his baby-like behavior in the movie was too long and boring, which was very frustrating. Gamora was also a bit different; in short, I don't know even the Gamora of the same timeline, they confused this issue a bit.The movie was good in terms of technical and CGI aspects. Although I have not liked the CGI that Marvel has done lately, it was quite good in this movie, which made me very happy. The use of music was also the best I've seen lately. It was a fantastic detail that was extremely well placed, despite a lot of music.In short, the place of this trilogy is very special for me. It was a good choice to make this movie emotional, and in some parts, it was really difficult to hold back tears, and I was amazed by Rocket's scene of losing his friends. Of course, there are minor problems, but I did not feel them because the strong parts were much better, and the movie flowed smoothly like water. I hope we will see these characters again...Note: I also thought Star-Lord's return to Earth was a great idea, Drax becoming a father, Nebula becoming a leader, Mantis being free, Rocket becoming a leader, and Groot accompanying him, all of it was fitting. When I left the movie, I felt strange because I didn't think about its missing parts, but rather how emotional and fragile life can be. This movie reminded me that I had forgotten some things, how precious animals are, and most importantly, that your teams define who you are.""","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","donz-8","20 May 2023","I'll keep this review short and simple. Aside from some awkwardly silly jokes and (only sometimes) slightly confusing pace, this was the best installment from the GOTG series. For the first time in a very long while, I really got 'pulled' in to the movie emotionally, something that hasn't happened since ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"". Since this review requires more ""characters"" I'll just add that GOTG 3 was a perfect finale to the series and I'm looking forward to the ""New Guardians"" (or whatever name they'll be referred to). With all of that being said, Guardians Vol. 3 is, without a doubt, one of the best MCU movies, definitely in the top 5 and well worth the price of admission.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","carterkev","12 September 2023","Sorry but what the hell is this mess. Marvel have lost it, it's time to pack it in. All the high scores on here must be paid or something. The film is stupid, all over the place, fat to much CGI and the so called humour in it is just not funny. The first one was good the second one was ok but this is a wreck of a film. Gamora character just annoying with the bad attitude all the time. I wanted to turn it off after half an hour I had had enough, but my wife gave it a go and even she, who is a fan said it just didn't work. I hope this is the end they need to move on and stop spending millions on CGI and get back to good stories and characters. Rocket is the best but they just made this depressing and awful.","1/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jamaisj","24 November 2023","This is arguably one of the best MCU movies. There is nothing really wasted, and everything has its place. While I wish Warlock had been better used, even he works. There are some really great running gags, Rocket's arc is great, and it's fun to see an almost campy villain.The only major strike against the movie is the High Evolutionary, who has little to do with his comic counterpart; this villain is just more of a psychopath with lots of resources. But it does lead to one of the most epic space fights I've ever seen, so I'll allow it. Well, that and the Stallone cameos.This is the perfect way to end a trilogy, but still leave plenty of room for a sequel. The humor is perfect, as well as the bathos of Rocket. This is an almost-perfect movie, and should be mandatory watching.","9/10"

Not suitable for kids at all.The parts without animal abuse were ok, we laughed a few times but felt like crying more often than not.Hopefully the true reviews shine through and Disney have a long hard look at themselves.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","T-ZER0","30 August 2023","Just when I think they have gone to the dogs, they manage to come out with a hit that I enjoy! Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is well-written, clever, funny and even made me cry a bit. This movie is essentially the equivalent of Avengers Endgame for the Guardians, they introduce new characters and give the old ones a loving send off.I wish they had Nova, but he wouldn't fit as they had so many characters already. I do wish Star-Lord and Gamora got back together, because I thought since the first one had to do with Peter's mother, and the second one his father, maybe the third will be a love story between them on how they get back together. But they instead focus on Rocket, which I have no problem with. They added Lyla Beaver, which is who I wanted to see after playing the Telltale video game.I literally was filled with emotion on the way they handled Rocket's story and how sad it was, but that made it more satisfying when he got payback against the high evolutionary. Speaking of which, I do think that Kang would have fit more in this movie as James Gunn originally intended, but the High Evolutionary works just fine. I also loved Cosmo in this film, despite what anyone says, She's a good dog. ;) and I wish I had a pet like her.In addition, they had a Michael Rooker cameo that was worth it, and seeing them finally separate made me sad. Also hearing Groot's first official English sentence! James Gunn clearly knows how to make a Marvel movie that is heartfelt and funny at the same time. I am so glad all of us made Disney finish this legendary trilogy. Hats off to you and all the fans. Also, thank you James Gunn. Your Guardians trilogy will be forever timeless. Best of luck to you as you go on to fix DC. We will miss you!","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","lifebythesmile","22 May 2023","This review contains no spoilers (and really there is nothing to spoil)I loved the first two Guardians movies. Yes they had fantastic special effects. Loads of action, yes. But more importantly they were well written, well thought out, well acted, had some truly beautiful choreography. The humor was fantastic. Quirky and clever. There were some truly touching moments. They made you think a bit, but they also made you feel something. They were more than movies. They were an experience. And I had dearly hoped that this last installment would live up to my expectations, but to my deep disappointment it did not.This movie like so many others today demands that we move past the reasonable suspension of disbelief, and into the suspension of intelligence.The non-stop action and pretty colors didn't save it from a plot full of holes. The humor managed to produce a chuckle or two yes, but ultimately it felt trite, forced, staged. And cinema is chock full of examples showing that a talented cast cannot salvage a movie from bad writing. Honestly, every time the movie tripped on a moment that was supposed to illicit some kind of emotional response I found myself cringing and thinking the script, the dialogue, must have been cobbled together by someone so lacking in emotional depth that the best they can do is regurgitate the old tropes they've seen watching other shows. They can't create what they don't understand so the best they can manage is to mimic. It was painful.And the fact that this movie has been given a rating of 8.3 by the viewing public tells me people have lost the ability to distinguish good from bad. I guess if Hollywood feeds people garbage long enough they stop realizing it's garbage and start thinking it's caviar.To me it's just another ugly sign of the ongoing decay of society. We have lost an appreciation for finer things. Most people can't even recognize quality any more. The older I get (and I'm not that old, yet) the more I have to look to the past for good cinema. Or to IFC movies. Or to foreign films.Mainstream media today is more and more....empty calories. It's bright, it's loud, it's fast....and it's it devoid or any real sustenance.What value this movie had was only in that it convinced me that there in the long, sad decline of Marvel there is no bottom. And it's time to stop giving them my money.","4/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","anonim-73883","7 May 2023","And so, the third ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is an excellent and I would even say epic conclusion to the entire trilogy of ""Guardians"".Let me start off by saying that I consider all Guardians movies to be the best Marvel movies ever!James Gunn filmed an unusual
CARTOON, but shot the best MOVIE in the MARVEL cinematic universe!For me, the third part is not inferior in quality to the first two parts (I have not watched the special yet)
I liked the plot of the film, surprisingly 150 minutes running time flew by very quickly and not noticeable!It was exciting, not boring and interesting.I am very happy that in this part, my favorite character Rocket became one of the main characters, only because of him I fell in love with the guards team and I am happy that in this part we were told the details about his difficult childhood.He is fully developed in this film, and his arc is closed, as well as the story arcs of other characters were closed perfectly.The whole time I laughed, empathized and worried about the characters, and also cried at some points.Also, I want to note the excellent acting and actors, excellent camera work, excellent graphics and VFX effects, a wonderful soundtrack, and much, much more, I did not notice any minuses in this film!In general, the third ""Guardians"" turned out to be quite an excellent, sweet, touching and lamp family film more than once.I give this film 10 out of 10 and I advise you to go to the cinema to see this film!P. S: MARVEL please make a spin-off movie / series / special about Rocket Raccoon!!!Because I would like to know what happened before Rocket got into the Guardian team and met Quill, and what happened after he left the laboratory !!!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Meme_Critic","31 August 2023","Ok when I stepped into the theater I was expecting to walk out listing to jams BUT I cried walking out because this movie shows the biggest emotion ever to movies I've seen this is no happy ending this is a action ending. Rocket it the main character who is dreaming about his childhood when he got hurt and is in the coma while Star lord and the other guardians try to help him. But the antagonist is the evolutionary who evolves things and wants to study rockets brain because he could solve something he could not. With Yondu coming back made me happy because he rocked in the last movie even though he is dead he is there. Star lord gives the guardians leader name to rocket at the end and leaves to live with his grandfather and at the end of the credit cut scene it says "" The legendary Star lord will return.""","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","av2009","2 September 2023","This wonderful movie made me laugh, cry, think, and feel. To be a sci-fi movie with alien and animal-robot hybrids, it had a tremendous amount of heart. The scenes with Rocket, Lylla, Teefs, and Floor were some of the best out of the entire film. So much love was poured into these animated characters! Guardians of the Galaxy has been one of my favorite series to emerge from the MCU. It has important themes about finding meaningful friendship in a universe where you feel as if you don't belong. I am sad to say goodbye to these characters and their stories, especially because I spent many hours watching them with my mother and making sweet memories, but I am so glad we've been able to enjoy the journey with them. To everyone involved with this project, well done! üëè","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","timwoodward1","8 July 2023","Should have stopped at no 2. Boring soundtrack, stupid dialogue, stupid characters and the heroes we have come to love have turned into annoying stereotypes with no redeeming qualities. Everything that made the first two movies great (especially the first) has been dumped leaving nothing but a poor fake impersonation of the Guardians. Make up is laughable looking like something from the 50s. Seriously this film is awful. If you enjoyed the other movies in the franchise do yourself a favour and give this one a wide berth so your memories of Guardians of the Galaxy is not fainted by this garbage.","4/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","prmacrae-13277","28 May 2023","My wife and I have rarely watched a movie that bored us as much as this one. There is no coherent plot or story line. There are so many characters its hard to keep track of them and the ""villain"" is not comic or particularly villainous, apart from shouting. There is very little humour, as the first two films had. Whenever the story flags, there's a fight scene of some sort. In its favour, the computer graphics are amazing, and there's a lot of imagination in the sets and backgrounds. But that's not enough to carry a movie, even a Marvel movie. As he did in Jurassic Park: Dominion, Chris Pratt looked embarrassed at times at the absurdity of his character and lines. I'd give this one a miss if I were you. If there were zero stars, that's what I'd give this film. What a waste of millions of dollars when good writing might have actually saved this.","1/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","marshalllangdon","5 August 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 does an excellent job of closing perhaps the MCU's best trilogy, all while being a heartwarming, emotional, and thrilling roller coaster ride.There's a bit of everything in here, from laugh out loud gags, to exciting and colorful action, to moments that make you cry.The cast is brilliant as always, with every character playing an important role in the Guardians adventure, but it is Rocket who is finally provided with some backstory, that greatly strengthens his character, as well as the characters around him.Marvel has been quite hit and miss lately, but I'm happy to inform that this film should be placed on the highest end of the Phase 4 and 5 spectrum.8.5/10 - Great.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","rdoliva","10 July 2023","It looks like writer and director Gunn had no idea what to write about, and could only focus on both seeing what drivel he could pass off as a movie script and how to spend the money he'd charge for that.While the first movie was very good and entertaining, the second one was ok, but it wasn't hard to see it all was coming apart. This one his rock bottom.It feels like a super long Seinfeld episode: a movie about nothing but which pretends to have something. Sentimentality replaces substance. Not even the effects are convincing, despite being high quality, because sometimes they don't fit the acting.I definitely won't be buying this Blu-ray Disc, not even on sale.","1/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sebasalvearangulo","14 October 2023","I have to admit something. I was not the biggest fan of Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2. I had a lot of issues with the film that took out basically any enjoyment. However, that didn't sour my hopes for this film. Following Suicide Squad and an excellent Holiday Special, my trust was put into James Gunn to deliver the conclusion that this team needed. And we got that and so much more. How a plot about a genetically engineered raccoon can touch on all my heart strings and make me cry is absolutely outstanding but James Gunn did it. He gives all of these characters such human personalities that you can't help but fall in love with every single one of these characters. The villain here is the strongest of the series by far. He is horrible in every regard and has no redeeming qualities. Each Guardian gets to complete their journey in the MCU. With an amazing soundtrack, fantastic performances all around, and a thrilling plot that gets really emotional at times, James Gunn leaves Marvel with a perfect film that is everything I asked for and more.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","twh-00286","8 July 2023","Hands down the most unimpressive GG to date.The best part was Rocket's story. And the end.Most of film just seemed contrived, with poor pacing. Lots and lots of yelling, anger, and just didn't seem to come together like the last films.Not sure what happened, but it just didn't seem able to ""find itself.""
Sure, there were new characters, which helped, but the main cast just seemed uninterested, lacking that chemistry that made the first two so great. Heck, the Christmas episode blew this one away. Even the laughter of Drax wasn't enough to keep this afloat.Not sure how anyone could rate this above a 7, not only as a standalone, but especially as part of such a wonderful series. It was, dare I say, boring- with the exception of Rocket and the last few minuets.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","hwesz","13 August 2023","The movie that didn't need to happen. Since when is Peter quill the biggest wimp ever? The scenery and costumes are beyond fake...did the audience need Rocket's backstory? Drax is as annoying as ever and the cool music that made the first movie stand out is forced and overdone. Nothing about this movie makes sense and it was difficult to pay attention to front the start. There's also random usuals of unexpected foul language that's out of character.The characters remind me of all the randoms you'd see in the Star Wars films and I think Disney just cobbled together scenes on all of the unused sets they had lying around from their mediocre Star Wars spin offs. This movie seems rushed and can't hold a candle to precious guardians of the galaxy films.","1/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dtstacey","3 August 2023","Just watched this cracking film and was totally surprised how good it was, I wouldn't say that it has totally restored my faith in the Marvel universe,because that is long gone, but when people like James Gunn make films, you have to watch them because he is obviously a fanboy and also, more importantly, he knows what he's doing.(.. if anybody can rescue the dysfunctional, DC universe, it would be him and I will be interested to see what he can do, having said that I I loved, Henry Cavill, superman, and Ben, Affleck and gal Gadot, as Batman, and Wonder Woman, respectively, it's a shame the second, Wonder Woman film was such a hot mess...). I am familiar with the origin of rocket raccoon in the comics, and although this was changed, it still made logical sense, and it was great to see his friend Lyla,in it, ditto, lots of other characters from the comics,(.. I chuckled when I spotted Howard, the duck in a scene,-I know his film was pilloried, but I remember I didn't think it was too bad in at all...), I was not sure about Will Poulter playing Adam warlock, but in the end I thought he did very well, as did everybody in this superb romp. My wife and I had laughter and tears in equal measure, easily the best of the three films. The first film was a breath of fresh air, the second was still fun if a little generic, but this one was a fitting climax to the trilogy, although at the end it did say ' star, Lord will return'.... Got to say, I would have to be interested in that, especially if Mr Gunn is at the Helm. Great Stuff!!!.....","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ronzille","3 August 2023","Only one bummer though: Gamora and Pete don't end up together? C'mon dude! They are the perfect couple. That unspoken thing that they had was one of the best things in superhero movie history. In my opinion the best power couple ever (and I'm a DC>>>Marvel type of guy, because of Batman).Anyway, the movie although much darker than vol. 1 and 2, has a powerful message in the end, as well as a good enough dose of positivity, something that ultimately this planet needs. The depiction of the Guardians is great, new team included. I also loved the fact that the High Evolutionary didn't have a backstory, because I bet that when everyone shed also a tear when we watched tears falling down from Thanos eyes when Mantis was keeping him under control, as his was still grieving for Gamora, as well as the end if Infinity War with him sitting and wathcing the sunset in peace, after fullfilling his purpose.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","salaarzeeshan","29 July 2023","An amazing farewell to our guardians of the galaxy making the trilogy perfect and goated. The plot of movie is mostly focused around the character of rocket, his past life and high evolutionary. The movie amazingly shows the relationship between the guardians and there relation with rocket specially peter and rocket relationship. It's shows there struggle to save rocket through out whole movie and also shows how far have they come compare to the first movie. Just like a average marvel movie the color and aesthetic of the movie was vibrant for most of the places. As always the movie does includes comdey moment and to be honest they are actually good comdey moments that doesn't feel unnecessary or forced, but at the same time the movie does gets serious when it's needed.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","bmschoen1","25 November 2023","Let me start by saying I used to be a huge Marvel fan, which is why it was so devastating to see the quality and feel of the movies deteriorate over the last few years. And while I have been over Marvel for some time, I still had this movie sitting unwatched. I couldn't bear to see the Guardians get ruined like the rest. But I did finally watch it and it was great. It wasn't exactly the sendoff I wanted, but it was definitely a good one nonetheless. James Gunn did a nice job keeping true to his characters, and I give him a ton of credit. It made me feel the old Marvel magic for possibly the last time, and for that I say, I'm most sincere terms, thank you.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cricketbat","3 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fitting finale to this trilogy of MCU movies. It's heavier & more violent than its precursors, but it manages to retain some of the levity this series is known for to keep things from getting too dark. This emotional rollercoaster is longer than it needed to be, with some sloppy screenplay moments to justify certain plot points and move things along. And the ending feels rushed as it tries to wrap everything up. I don't agree with all the decisions James Gunn made during Guardians 3, but I do think that it's an exciting ride that is on par with the other two movies.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","joshuavogel79","15 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy isn't really about a gang. It's Peter Quill's story. He's the only one of them who isn't a cartoon. We're emotionally invested in Peter from the moment our trilogy takes off.In this movie, Peter takes a back seat to Rocket, a character whose best attribute is that he was used just sparingly enough that he didn't ruin the first movie. He was only ever comic relief. The tone of this character was clownish on the moment we meet him. It was an absolutely ridiculous mistake to the side to try to use him as the emotional centerpiece of this story.He was an adequately CGI'd cartoon. Most of us tolerated him as a character, ask the necessary baggage required to bring a children's comic book to life. Whoever wrote this movie apparently thought that they could leverage a hatred of animal cruelty into some sort of emotional connection with a character that has not an ounce of believability.The Russian space dog had more depth than rocket.The movie we came here to see was the continuation of Quill's story. He has a second chance at love. We wanted to see that happen. Even a plot arc where we see Quill and Nebula find love would have been something compelling.Or what about the next chapter in his evolution? We know now that he's half God... Does he still have some access to the extraordinary powers he tapped into in the last volume? Powers that he could use to... Oh I don't know... Guard the Galaxy?No. Instead we get an incredibly boring story about Rocket, a character I can't even force myself to care about.And of course, this movie suffers from an incredibly boring villain. Once again we are introduced to a villain who is so obscenely evil that he feels totally flat and unbelievable. Animal cruelty? Xenocide? Not a single personality trait beyond megalomania, narcissism, and psychopathy. *Yawn""On the end of the day we're left with a movie that has no emotional weight at all. And it doesn't even have the decency to be fun or funny.They were even scraping the barrel in terms of the soundtrack. It feels like a franchise that has run out of steam. What a sad send-off.","2/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Reviews_of_the_Dead","7 August 2023","This was a movie that Jaime and I wanted to see in the theater, but with an infant was difficult to find the time. When I saw this was streaming on Disney+, we watched it over the weekend since this is a long movie. Jaime isn't necessarily into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Guardians of the Galaxy is a series she liked before me.For this, we are picking up where the last events of Guardians of the Galaxy: Christmas Special as well as Avengers: Endgame. We know that Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is alive but doesn't remember anything of her time with the Guardians. This bums out Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt). I should say that the Guardians' current line-up is Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Drax (Dave Bautista), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Groot (Vin Diesel) and Peter.This movie explores the history of Rocket. He was created by The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) and his group. There is a heartbreaking story as Rocket gains awareness and makes friends with other similar creatures. When he learns that he is to be disposed of, Rocket decides to free his friends and himself. The problem is that The High Evolutionary anticipated that. This partially explains why Rocket is as bitter with life as he is.We also get to meet another interesting character of Adam Warlock (Will Poulter). He's the son of Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki). He is there to take Rocket back to The High Evolutionary. Things don't go as planned though and we see how ruthless our new villain is.That is where I'm going to stop with my recap as this has a lot going on in it. This runs two and half hours, clocking in as one of the longer non-Avengers films in the MCU. I understand why. This movie is fun while also pulling at the heartstrings. There might be a few times that I legit had tears. It is surprising to do for a movie like this. I'm not sure that's happened since watching Endgame so kudos there. There are also major shake-ups here for this group going forward so it needed to be longer as well.Let me then go over to the filmmaking. This is as you would expect, a CGI fest. This has Disney money though so it looks good. We get epic battle scenes. That's one thing James Gunn can do. They use slow-motion quite a bit. I could have used less there. While watching it, I get why though. There are so many members of the group that is the best way to showcase them. I'm glad what they do here to bridge the gap to the next film. Another key aspect to these movies is the soundtrack. This probably has the weakest of the scores, but that is still better than 90% of the movies in the MCU. I might even be undercutting my number there as well.What I'll say is if you're a fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy, see this movie. If you follow the MCU, see this movie. I'd even recommend it to non-fans of the series. This is just a great movie in my opinion. The best I've seen since Endgame for sure.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","GooseStar","3 May 2023","Just watched Guardian's Of The Galaxy Volume 3 and in my opinion it was amazing. This movie was heartfelt and it had some of the best action I've seen from a Marvel movie. The villian was everything I wanted from Kang. He was scary he showed his power and most importantly killed people. All of the Guardian's had there time to shine but most importantly was Rocket. We got his tragic backstory that we got to see throughout the movie and even got to see him face off against The High Evolutionary near the end of the movie. Honestly everything was perfect. I've wanted a good marvel movie for so long and this movie finally did that.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","bout-87025","3 August 2023","Not gonna trauma dump but I watched this movie today as it's now on Disney and man... this is the right time of my life for a movie like this to come around. I'm not the biggest Marvel anymore. I didn't finish secret invasion and the only MCU movie I've seen in cinemas since No Way Home was black panther. I would have seen GOTG V3 but I watched spiderverse instead. Absolutely adore that movie and it's actually my favourite movie even though I watch a large variety and don't only indulge myself with the super hero genre. This isn't a review as much as it just me sharing how I felt but let me tell you; if you wanna watch something heartfelt yet entrancing and comedic, then this is the movie for you. I had to take a break from the movie when there was an hour left and not in particular because of the movie as such, but I cried the most I ever have in a long time. Rocket's story was so tragic yet deeply blissful. I got nervous and sad plenty in the final act thinking someone was going to die but thankfully no one did. I like it much better that way. Anyway, it's late and I'm emotional (plus this isn't reddit) so good day everyone!If you couldn't tell already, I made an account just to write this. Movies goes hard fr.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","southdavid","7 May 2023","Eagerly awaited, given how much I liked the first two, and coming at a point when Marvel could use another top tier crowd pleaser after a string of successes, though not exactly unqualified ones, ""Guardians of the Galaxy - Volume 3"" is a tear-jerking success and easily their best film since ""Spiderman: No Way Home"".An attack on Nowhere by Sovereign weapon Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) leaves Rocket (Bradley Cooper) fighting for his life. Desperate to save their friend, the other Guardian's try and track down the lab where his body was experimented on, which ultimately leads them to The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) an unfeeling genetic scientist hell bent on creating the perfect society and desperate for the chance to dissect the brain of Rocket, his most successful experiment. To access his facilities, Nebula (Karen Gillen) reaches out to Gamora (Zoe Saldana) for specialist help.Yes, I cried at the end. Not at any one particular aspect of the finish particularly, but more a sort of low-level emotional moments that tie up what feels like the end of a large section of the MCU, that ebbed and flowed as the perfect song was chosen, or the perfect reunion happens. There are two big levels of pain that GOTG3 is tasked with dealing with. Rockets trauma and survivors' guilt about the time he was experimented on, and Quill's inability to accept that his Gamora has gone, and the one still walking about doesn't love him. There were funny moments too, I should say, it's not one long cavalcade of misery.What it also is, is phenomenally good looking. I know that Feige has said that they're going to refocus on fewer/better films and one area where they can look to improve is the special effects, but for whatever reason this film, with several all-CGI characters, has entirely avoided that issue. I don't know if it's that Gunn is a stronger minded director than others, and refused the compromises, but it's certainly worth it.It's not, perhaps quite at the level of ""Infinity War"" or ""No Way Home"". It doesn't have fan servicing ability that either of those have - but it's a surprisingly dark and mature film and I enjoyed it a lot.","8/10"

The tone, weak writing and CGI jammed down your throat all seems more like an audition to work for DC and their low quality entertainment, rather than any serious attempt to grow the Guardian's franchise. Gunn could have, and should have shaved 60 minutes from this 2 hour grim mess. I've no interest in seeing any further Gunn projects, especially if he continues making animal snuff films under a Marvel banner. This isn't a family movie, it's for people who think torture can be entertaining. No thanks, Marvel.","3/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","marcotiero","4 May 2023","First things last: One reviewer scored this low because he ""casually went one afternoon"" on release day to see this, he claimed to have not seen the first 2 then wonders why he didn't know who any of the characters etc. What did you expect?There's also the guy who gave it 1 star ""temporarily"" because he's not seen it yet but all the reviews must be fake. The movie has a May 5th release date in the US but countries like the UK and New Zealand it was released on the third, so maybe you should take these things into account.Anyway, on with the review!This was a fantastic movie, and the positive reviews reflect this. It had everything you could want from a ""Guardians"" movie - Heart & soul, comedy, catchy tunes, fantastic action and visually stunning. It was a thrilling ride from start to finish and it was beautiful in IMAX 3D.One thing to add, though, is that it has more profanity than you'd usually expect in an MCU movie, which doesn't bother me but parents might want to be aware before taking their kids if this is an issue for them.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","bhernandez2216","8 May 2023","This movie was so beautifully well done. Marvel Studios has done it again! I have to admit James Gunn did a good job writing and directing his final installment of the franchise for Marvel, but now after Guardians 3, I'm never gonna trust James Gunn again, after what he did to Henry Cavill and running for DC Universe, so nice try Mr. Gunn, lol!Anyways, Chris Pratt, Zoe Salda√±a, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan and the rest of the cast and crew have done a beautiful job with there roles, and the story was so beautifully written with so much emotional stories to tell about Rocket, but I'm not gonna give anything away, so NO SPOILERS!I did cry 3 times in every moments, the humors were pretty funny, and the whole VFX was beautiful. But still, I wasn't ready to say goodbye to the Guardians of the Galaxy. It may be the end of the franchise, but wherever they are, or what Marvel is planning for the Guardians of the Galaxy ... a new journey, and a whole new adventure, and a new story... has just begun.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","smaniatopoulos","6 August 2023","Marvel has pretty much destroyed or abandoned each and every one of its properties or replaced them with mediocrities.The Guardians survived the demise of Thanos and so we got a third movie that nobody really expected or necessarily wanted, considering the second one was not any good and the Guardians had been overexposed in the Avenger movies, so it rather seemed like there no longer was any purpose for one more space opera.Thankfully, Mr Gunn decided that he needs closure before he moved on to the DC Universe, so he got to write and direct the 3rd movie, focusing on the origins of Rocket Rackoon and the famous Marvel villain known as the High Evolutionary.And basically he nailed it.This is in my book the best of the Guardians trilogy, even better than the first one. It is flawless. Yes, there is (as always) a lot of action but it perfectly fits the plot and this time you care, especially since every action scene becomes a plot device to move the story forward. And although in the last few scenes most of the action clich√©s expected in this sort of movie become prevalent, the excellent script, the very touching and humane story and the wonderfully depicted characters take precedence from the action and make Guardians an excellent scifi movie and one of the best space operas (if not the best) ever made.This movie is Marvel's last chance to redeem itself from the catastrophic period it entered after the end of the Avengers and it should focus on these characters going forward. All its other properties seem totally irrelevant, indifferent and abused to sell politics and create social platforms.This is the only decent movie they have released in 4 years, and they should focus on movie making. It's a real shame that the same people who can create masterpieces like Guardians 3 are wasted on artless and horrible creations such as Antman 3, Dr Strange 2 and all the pseudo-progressive tv series of the past few years.It may be time they seriously consider bringing mr Gunn back from DC and giving him the helm. These days it seems like all Mr Feige cares about is a future career in politics.If they don't find a way to replicate the triumph of storytelling and inspiration that Guardians 3 is, this movie may very well be Marvel's swan song.","9/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","entranceafx-08703","3 August 2023","Marvel has presented us with abysmal contents for the last few years. But this was not it. A truly heartfelt rendition by James Gunn has nibbled a bit of my heart in a corner. Rocket truly deserved his story be told to us and this was a genuinely beautiful way of doing it. I hope Marvel keeps making stories this good in the years to come and give them the proper time to be developed instead of rushing them out of the door for the next quarterly board meeting.Nothing more to say.Performance was great. Story was beautifully executed. This is what happens when artists work on a piece on their own. Please get the suites to keep sitting at their chairs and let the real people do the work they were meant to do.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","osecco-16354","5 May 2023","The first Guardians of the Galaxy really surprised me and I loved the movie (so much it was my top favourite Marvel until No Way Home), and the second wasn't as great but still enjoyed it. This one made me feel.... Really let down and wanting more.I did enjoy the more serious tone in parts - especially how Quill felt more like an anti-hero and hardened from all his losses, Nebula and Rocket were very well written, and how it felt like genuine closure for many of the characters stories, but for me that was kind of it.First it felt like the characters, specially Drax/Nebula/Mantis didn't like each other for most of the film (which was strange as the whole thing is set up to be protecting one of their own) and Adam Warlock was SUPER underwhelming - really felt more his whole point of existence was to save Quill in the end. And I get they wanted to make Drax more of a parent in this film, but I felt like Gamora in the sense they wanted the old Drax gone and made him knew to the point he's a whole new character. I'm also not sure how to feel about Gamora's plot; I liked her roughness but also felt she was too angsty and didn't like anyone; but also Quill felt a little similar to that in Guardians 1, so maybe to show how the ravagers affected them and their childhood traumas.The humour was definitely different too, but was unsure how much of it was genuinely funny or not. Also the amount of fake out deaths (like seriously both Drax and Nebula should have died more than once but are miraculously healed scenes later) was really strange, cause James Gunn is a great writer where that isn't needed. The soundtrack was good for the most part, but where in between kidnapping Kevin Bacon and Tony Stark's funeral did Quill learn about ""Creep"" but more importantly ""The Dog Days are Over""? Do not get me wrong I adore both Radiohead and Florence Welsh but it felt like my own spotify shuffle going from 90's to 70's to 80's to 2000's....I will say too - the multiple shots of animal abuse was definitely not needed. I get Rocket had a super traumatic upbringing, but seeing animals with robotic parts or destroyed in a chamber felt very excessive. IDK why we needed about 5 different flashbacks of it but I genuinely felt like I couldn't sit through the rest of the movie after the 2nd scene. I think it should be more discussed in reviews that happens as it can be triggering for young kids and even some adults.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","rich-871","4 May 2023","I'll be the first to say I loathe and detest what Marvel's turned into over the last few years. But this was up there with the very very best. A perfect way to send off characters we've grown to love and adore over most of the last decade.It could have easily been by-the-numbers but it has real emotional depth, adds some great new characters in, but most importantly gives the characters a proper end to their arcs.You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll think ""No!"" and ""Yes!"" Naturally the soundtrack adds a lot too - similar to the last two Guardians film, it's an eclectic mix of music - some of which really hits the spot.So yeah. James Gunn, thank you! You gave your creations a perfect send-off. Thanks mate x.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","fredschaefer-406-623204","7 May 2023","When it arrived nine years ago, James Gunn's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY instantly became one the most popular films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The premise of a ragtag gang of super powered beings coming together and becoming reluctant heroes really struck a chord with comic fans and even those who were casual super hero film followers. The film had distinctive characters, and a lot of humor driven by the uniqueness of these heroes and their sharp edged personalities which were vividly rendered by some perfect casting choices. And a great soundtrack filled some of the best singles of the '70s was an added bonus. There had been some banger comic book films before GOTG, THE DARK KNIGHT and CAPTAIN AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER being among the best, but GUARDIANS had a real sense of fun, and a lot of heart. I think this was mainly due to director and writer Gunn, who took a group of heroes that many die hard Marvel fans would have had a hard time placing in the comic universe and making them superstars. The follow up, subtitled Vol. 2, fell short of the bar set by the original, but it still had a lot going for it. I didn't like the way they used Kurt Russell (they didn't give him a scene with Sylvester Stallone so we could have had a TANGO AND CASH reunion), but they did allow Michael Rooker's Yondu to shine.Now, six years after the last installment in the franchise, we finally get Volume 3. Peter Quill is mourning the loss of Gamora, and drinking too much, while the rest of the Guardians seem to be in a similar funk as being heroes in the post ENDGAME MCU has taken a toll. This torpor comes to an abrupt end when they are attacked by Adam Warlock, a minion of The High Evolutionary, who is revealed to be Rocket Raccoon's creator, and now wants him back, or to be more precise, wants his evolved brain back. Warlock is driven off temporarily, but Rocket is left near death. His team mates must now find a way to save him, and in the process, confront The High Evolutionary and his plan to build a counter-Earth by constantly experimenting on lower life forms to create a ""perfect"" race. Think of The Planet of Dr. Moreau.At two and a half hours, there's a lot going on in GOTG Vol. 3, including Peter's attempt to jump start a romance with an alternate universe version of Gamora who doesn't remember him. But the heart of the film is Rocket's story, or more to the point, his back story, which is revealed in flashbacks. Animal experimentation and vivisection are featured prominently, along with the genocide of The High Evolutionary's failed experiments. This is a dark turn, one tinged with true sadness as we understand Rocket's pain and loss. I think this tricky change in tone works, mainly because James Gunn is a very good director of this kind of material, and he has done the work necessary to earn a proper payoff. Gunn also stages some good action scenes, especially a confrontation in a hallway at The High Evolutionary's HQ between an army of his minions and the Guardians where the latter cut loose in a way that reminds us of why they are such a lethal force to deal with when the chips are down. There's good use of CGI to create a cosmic level comic story, including some neat looking monsters, even if other worlds like Knowhere are starting to have an awfully familiar look to them. Though much of the attention is on Rocket and Peter, Drax, Mantis, Nebula, and Groot all have their moments that remind us why they are fan favorites. One of the most important elements in any comic adaptation is the villain, and thankfully Chukudi Iwuji's High Evolutionary goes above and beyond. His bad guy is an old style megalomaniac mad scientist right out of a horror film with no effort to make him ""relatable."" And the reveal of his final appearance, when we see the damage Rocket has done to his face, is truly a horror moment; one of the reasons why GOTG Vol. 3 may not be suitable for younger kids. Another thing I liked about this installment in the franchise is that it is pretty much free of any social or political agenda, something that can't be said about other recent MCU films. It's refreshing that the fate of the universe doesn't depend on a teenage girl for once. Gamora, Nebula, and Mantis, are bad ass female characters, but they are also allowed to be flawed and funny.GOTG Vol. 3 does have its faults. My biggest gripe is the way they used the character of Adam Warlock, who is a big heavy hitter in the Marvel comic universe, but he could have easily been cut out of this story entirely and replaced with a minor villain. As I said, some of the CGI does not impress that much anymore, and it is overlong, though the pacing makes up for it. All in all, I did not walk out of this final Guardians film with any sense of disappointment, something I can't say for the last three MCU films-THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER, WAKANDA FOREVER, and QUANTAMANIA. That I chalk up to James Gunn, who is departing for the DCEU, where hopefully his talents will be put to use reviving Superman, Batman, and a whole host of other iconic superheroes. But he leaves behind a sputtering MCU, which appears to be going nowhere from a lack of direction and bad writing. All of this squandering the good will of many diehard fans like myself. Though GOTG Vol. 3 is promoted as the ""last ride"" of the Guardians, the mid credits and final credit scenes promise their return. I'd be up for a project that centered on Will Poulter's Adam Warlock, one that did justice to Jim Starlin's creation, but I'm not so sure I want to see Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Karan Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn, the voice work of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel return in their super hero alter egos without James Gunn at the helm. Maybe the three GOTG films should be left to stand alone as one of the strongest pillars of the MCU, but if there is more money to be squeezed out of it by Disney/Marvel, then sadly, that is what will probably happen.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","JacuzziEdits","3 May 2023","I believe that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is not only the best MCU film since ""Endgame"", but it's actually the best MCU film to date. I simply cannot understand why someone thought it was a good idea to fire James Gunn. It was a foolish decision. Gunn's creative vision and direction made this film an absolute masterpiece. The decision not to kill off any relevant characters was a smart one. It left everyone scattered throughout the galaxy, with each character on their own journey. For example, Peter is back on Earth with his grandpa. The High Evolutionary was a great villain and was perfectly suited to the storyline. This film was so emotional that it moved some viewers to tears, which is a testament to its quality.We now have a new team, consisting of Rocket, Adam, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, and a female character whose name I do not know. I hope that we do not get a ""GOTG Vol. 4"" without James Gunn, as he is the only one who could write and direct a worthy follow-up to this perfect trilogy. The post-credit scene hinted that Star-Lord will return, which is sure to excite fans. I hope that we get to see an emotional scene in ""Avengers: The Kang Dynasty"" or ""Secret Wars"" where all of the Guardians (OG) reunite in a beautiful moment.","10/10"

Really I cried like 3/4 times in a single movie, I laughed so hard and i Enjoyed the Soundtrack of this movie.James Gunn really does justice to every characters in his Movie. This Movie had screentime for each and every member of the Guardians. The CGI was so clean and perfect. The introduction of Adam Warlock was one of the best Introduced Scene i have seen in cinematic history.If you Cry and root for talking Racoon and a Talking Tree then THIS IS THE CINEMA.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","asweetpea92","4 August 2023","The fact the Nathan Fillion is in volume 3 is the number one reason why I gave this movie a 10 out of 10. On top of Nathan Fillion being in this one though, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked this movie since I don't normally care for sequel movies. The story line was really thought out in my opinion & I love the one liners as well as the continuation of the chosen family aspect. I would definitely watch this movie again & recommend it to others. I loved getting into Rockets backstory, even though it was heartbreaking. All that being said though, I'm going to go rewatch FIREFLY now...","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","BandSAboutMovies","6 May 2023","I'm predisposed toward liking this movie.Let me tell you why.James Gunn did things the video store way, starting his career at Troma, where he made Tromeo and Juliet. He moved on to writing the Scooby Doo movies and the Dawn of the Dead remake before making Slither. But he's always had comic book aspirations from early films like The Specials and Super. The adaptions he's made so far have been smaller affairs, starting with Guardians of the Galaxy.The Guardians are the kind of characters that not that many people were aware of before the movies. The characters come from the kind of books you once found in quarter bins. Starlord was first in Marvel Preview #4 in January 1976 with Rocket Racoon appearing three issues later before not being used again until May 1982's The Incredible Hulk #271. In the first thirty years of their existence, Starlord rarely appeared and Rocket only was in ten comic books.The Guardians were the same way, first showing up all the way back in the January 1969 Marvel Super-Heroes #16. Roy Thomas said, ""Guardians of the Galaxy started out as an idea of mine: about super-guerrillas fighting against Russians and Red Chinese who had taken over and divided the USA. I got a sort of general approval from Stan Lee and gave the idea to Arnold Drake, since I had not time to write and research it. Arnold went in for a conference with Stan, and Stan (maybe Arnold, too) decided to change it to an interplanetary situation. All the characters and situations in Guardians were created by Arnold and/or Stan.""They appeared every once every few years but didn't really take hold until June 1990. That's when Jim Valentino created the Guardians that I've always loved. Few of them are in these movies -- Martinex shows up in a cameo, Yondu is a lot different -- but that series was one of the true joys of the grim and gritty early 1990s.Then, in 2008, following the Annihilation: Conquest series, we got the Guardians team that led to the film series, which wow, was a gamble.The Guardian movies changed the idea of what the Marvel Cinematic Universe was all about. Instead of do gooders, the Guardians were space pirates, the children of world killing final bosses and scarred survivors of worlds destroyed, the last of their kind. And yet, the films had a comedic tone that inspired the Thor movies and gave the Avengers films some comedic lift.So here we are with Gunn's last movie before leaving to lead another attempt at DC movies. And throughout the ads for this movie, the hype and even the film itself, it has the feel of Lando in Return of the Jedi, constantly feeling like someone is going to die and you're going to lose that character forever.The fact that this movie has those stakes and you have those feelings points to its strength.I've also been thinking about how no one wants to be challenged by art any longer. Now, go with me on this, even if you don't believe that comic book movies are cinema. I believe they are and that comics are no different than mythology or any heroic myth.Tonight during The Last Drive-In, the Twitter audience was complaining that one of the two selections, Tigers Are Not Afraid, was too dark and they couldn't make jokes and fun of the movie. Playing Mystery Science Theater 3000 is not why I watch movies. Nor is needing a support group and being there for one another during troubling movies. Movies should push your emotions.A lot of criticism directed against Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 lies in its tone. There are children enslaved by the High Evolutionary, who also figures into the origin of Rocket, tearing him apart and rebuilding him into the cybernetic cynical creature that he has become.And let me tell you, there are moments in that origin that are harrowing and in no way for kids. But the fact that they can push our emotions and make us notice those narratives shifts, well...isn't that what great movies should do?This is the kind of movie that can have a spaceship that has been made out of the severed head of a dead space god; a talking Russian cosmodog with mental powers; that has a world called Counter-Earth filled with animal people and all the problems of our world; and also one that finds each of the Guardians with very real issues: Starlord (Chris Pratt) has fallen into a drunken stupor after the double loss -- once in death, another as she was reborn as a being that does not remember him -- of Gamora (Zoe Saldana ); Nebula (Karen Gillan) making the grand journey from unstoppable amoral killing machine into the person responsible for the lives of the misfits that live inside Knowhere; Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista, as always, growing as an actor) also making growth from killer to father, the role he was always meant for; Mantis (Pom Klementieff) dreaming of a better life; Groot (Vin Diesel) communicating with just three words; even Kraglin (Sean Gunn) trying to assume the mantle of leadership that Yondu left to him.The movie gets going when Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), the creation of first movie villain Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), blasts into Knowhere and nearly kills Rocket, whose body is made of machine code that doesn't allow him to be healed. To save their friend, the Guardians make a deal with the devil -- Gamora -- and track down who created Rocket, even if it means they have to fly into what looks for all intents and purposes to be a space butthole.Despite being fired -- that social story about Gunn was always wrong -- Gunn would come back for this last story, telling The Hollywood Reporter, """"In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula -- and some of the other forthcoming heroes -- goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit.""And that's why I loved this movie.Yes, it's dark. Yes, the tone shifts a lot. Yes, it's overstuffed with ideas.But why is that a bad thing?Maybe we need to be challenged.A few other random things I enjoyed:The music: I usually make fun of needledrop moments in movies, but that's often because they're so obvious. Instead, this movie features some songs I genuinely love in moments that they truly fit: Faith No More's ""We Care a Lot,"" Spacehog's ""In the Meantime,"" The Replacements' ""I Will Dare,"" Alice Cooper's cover of the vaudeville song ""I'm Always Chasing Rainbows"" are all absolutely the right songs at the right time, topped by the Adrian Belew mention in the credits scenes.The end: I don't want to give anything away, but after an entire movie of those Lando moments, the feeling as ""Dogs Days Are Over"" plays are so uplifting that it makes the entire film cathartic. You go through the darkness to find the light.The deep Marvel characters: Beyond Sylvester Stallone returning as Starhawk, there's also Martinex (Michael Rosenbaum), Mainframe (Tara Strong instead of Miley Cyrus), Howard the Duck (Seth Green), The Broker (Christopher Fairbank) from the first movie, Bzermikitokolok (Rhett Miller from The Old 97s), Phylla (the daughter of Captain Mar-Vell in the Marvel comics; she's the young girl fighting alongside the new Guardians in the end credits) and Lem sorcerer Krugarr.Finally, a bad guy you can hate: Gunn and Chukwudi Iwuji worked to make the High Evolutionary a character with nothing redeeming or sad about him. Instead, he's near pure evil, a scientist who sees every creation as expendable, but shocked that Rocket, a throwaway creation, was somehow smarter than him.Also: this has the first f-bomb in MCU history, a ""The Legendary Star-Lord will return"" credit that reminded me of when they did that at the end of every James Bond movie and a gunfight sequence with Groot and Starlord that felt like John Woo within the MCU.And finally: When Rocket realizes what the High Evolutionary has done, as he screams in utter despair, only to finally see the sky moments later, wow. Just wow. That's why I go to the movies.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jeffmaasjm","6 May 2023","Speeding up an action sequence until it is a blur doesn't make it more exciting. Louder isn't better and it doesn't add to the story or experience. The story isn't bad but it is held back with the modern Marvel Studios decisions to make every battle more 'epic' than the last. More people, faster spinning, louder noise and rinse and repeat with 10% more for each battle. Acting was alright, story was alright, soundtrack was solid enough, designs were good but sped up to blur and volume raised to pounding distracted rather than complemented. I wish I could have seen more of the details in the world but sped up to fast and it was all a blur.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","esjacobs","12 September 2023","SO surprised by this movie. I have not watched the other ones (or any Marvel film) started them but wasn't captivated so never finished them so I didn't followed the storyline. Still I had no problem enjoying this movie on it's own. It's such an emotional film and that's what I wasn't expecting at all from a Marvel movie. I cared for the characters, in this one the storyline of Rocket is central and we follow along his journey where he came from and how it ties with the threat they (the guardians) have to face right now. As a animal lover, this hit me right in the feels. Loved the message it brought across. Also the music is so good and gives a light touch to the whole somewhat emotional ride. Loved the humor, the witty banter between the characters and I was just entertained the whole time. So even for the non Marvel or Guardians of the galaxy fans, this is such a recommendation. The rating is so deserved and I'm so glad I gave it a chance and pressed 'play'.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ReginaldDwight7","14 May 2023","It would have been fitting if they had used Meatloaf's classic song ""Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad"" for this movie because that's exactly what I was thinking when I walked out of the theater.In and of itself, this 3rd installment has action, humor, and hits the feels hard. HOWEVER, I'm very sad to say I did not like it and felt extremely let down...and it's James Gunn and what he did so amazingly well in the first two films that is to blame. I enjoyed the first 2 so much that changing gears so dramatically just did me in. Whatever special sauce that went into the first 2 movies that made me feel so good was so glaringly withheld from Volume 3 that it just left me feeling empty.The first two movies have the perfect balance of laughs, intensity, and music. It never went too far in any one direction. This movie on the contrary is dark...very dark...and it overshadows the feel of the film from beginning to end. After the first 20 minutes I thought, ""Boy I hope the rest of the movie isn't like this."" - but it was. Oh man was it ever. The tone of this movie is just so overwhelmingly different this time around. Gone is that ""fun"" teamwork feel that we've come to love so much. Gone is the crafty decision to not take the whole thing too seriously.One of the film's biggest ironies is that even though they go to such great lengths diving into Rocket's back story that you actually miss out on enjoying the fun, wise-cracking, kick-ass character from the first 2 films because that persona is completely missing in Volume 3.There are those occasions in film when the director breaks a very crucial, yet unspoken rule about a viewer's emotional bond and affinity with the characters. By choosing to not reunite Peter and Gamora (in what would have been a magical note to end on), I believe many viewers will be left unsatisfied. (And yes it is important sometimes to give the viewer what they want - especially if they have already been on this rollercoaster for so many years now.) Yes, I realize Gamora has no memory of her past but this film teased us with opportunities for a rekindled romance. To not bring them back together to me, was a crime.I'm bummed out for my kids. They loved the first 2 movies and could handle the killing and violence pretty well because many times James Gunn brilliantly made killing bad guys FUNNY. There's no way on earth they could watch this movie. It's got too much sadness, too much torture, too much emotional damage, and it has parts that are just plain gross - like almost horror movie type grossness.And what happened to the great music from the first 2 movies? Volume 3 has a few good songs but it's nowhere near the caliber of the first 2. Not even close.Lastly, this movie is at least 30 minutes too long. I felt like the big ship (or whatever that thing was of the High Evolutionary) was on fire for the last half of the movie. The film felt like it tried to end about 5 times.::sigh:: It's time for me to go back to watching Volumes 1 and 2. Like I said, Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad...","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dorMancyx","8 May 2023","What's difficult about ending a trilogy is how to depict a new journey without derailing from the given context, while having it distinct and memorable from the previous - The Russo brothers had done so in Civil War, Nolan too in Batman Rises, and James Gunn in Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3.Traversing their groundbreaking assemble in the first movie and the intergalactic flamboyance in the second, the Guardians finally arrived at their last ride together. Perhaps because it is his ultimate play in the MCU, James approached the film with a waywardly creative and almost selfishly stylish artistry, whether the greasy meatball planet, the earthly furry neighborhood, or the f-bomb-dropping dialogues. Despite its cartoonish settings, GoG3 is still unquestionably the best Marvel movie since Stage 4 due to its fascinating action sequences and poignant stories. With three major battles larger and larger of scale and intensity, the most mesmerizing combat has to be the hallway infiltration. Flawless choreography and one-take technique for starter, the scene fully showcases not only each Guardians' distinct abilities, but their fluent combos which takes me back to the airport showdown in Civil War. Moreover, the drone-like cinematography captures all aspects of the fight to their totality in swift and ingenious movements, even travelling through a penetrated wound. Jointing these battles are often joking interactions native to the GoG franchise, including out-of-context punchlines and dark humor. In juxtaposition to the laughter is Rocket's recollection, which thoroughly elicits the traumatic backstory of our adored mascot, making him one of my favorite Marvel characters once again. My only complaint for Gunn's peculiarly impeccable directing is the music: indeed, the success of Come And Get Your Love and Mr. Blue Sky is in the gene of GoG, but it doesn't mean that an entire film should be loaded with vintage tunes, and I would still like to have the Guardians' theme as the most prominent part of the music.(Spoilers Ahead!)For its curtain-falling purpose, the movie provides each Guardians with their spotlight moments: Warlock's childly curiosity contrasting his overwhelming prowess, Nebula's self-sacrificial resolve when protecting her family, Mantis' empathetic insight into those around her, Drax's heartwarming fatherhood towards the trapped children, Gamora's arc from inattentive to firmly abiding justice, and Peter's development from infatuated with one's past to pursuing himself... And yet, none of these could amount to James' obvious favorite, Rocket Raccoon. With his private storyline, Rocket's vanity, insecurity, and self-doubt are all reasoned as his tragedy gradually unravels: he habitually thieves and mechanizes because these two skills emancipated him from the most repulsive of hellholes, the place where his hopes were demolished twice (to live in High Evolutionary's utopian society and then to escape with his friends) and heart was impaled thrice (death of Lylla, Teefs, Floor). Bearing physical experiment harsher than Thanos' punishment to his daughter, Rocket could not bear to relive the pain of bereavement, which is why he treats those around him with vitriol and cynicism, pretending to sever oneself from genuine bonds. Another character worthy of discussion is the villain, High Evolutionary, a rare Marvel antagonist since Stage 4 that you can irredeemably hate. With little to none background given, the maniacal scientist was obsessed with inhumane bio-engineering to satiate his sense of godly accomplishment, which, when provoked by his own creation's excellence, sought to demonstrate dominion with the most personal assault. However, he was once again defeated by the animal, disfigured in specific, a near-rated-R, literal face-off. Instead of feeling traumatized, High Evolutionary went the other extreme, becoming even more deranged and motivated, just to ""perfect"" his life's failure. Again, an uncommon antagonist who's meant to be the center of abhorrence, and definitely a better villain to whatever variant of Kang it was in Quantumania.No other Marvel trilogy is as unique, complete, and unforgettable as the Guardians of the Galaxy, and I do not take objections for my statement. Honestly, I'm surprised by James Gunn's creative indefatigability especially in a downhill era for superhero movies, and I'm rather hopeful for his agenda concerning the DCU. For GoG3 in particular, it has been a long time since I felt the lingering taste of a movie upon exiting the theater: the throbbing of heart when rewinding a fight scene, the nasal acidity when sympathizing with a character, and the long exhale of relief after the credits roll when all the original Guardians rest aside each other. Thank you for the ride.","8/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Silver5963","17 November 2023","The Perfect Trilogy is an elusive title. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man almost succeeded until Venom and Bully Maguire thwarted that. Lord of the Rings almost succeeded but threw it away at the end with it's painfully long goodbye scene and the plot hole regarding the eagles. However, we're finally looking at the pinnacle of cinema trilogies with the third movie in a set of brilliant films!Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 takes everything that worked about the first two films and expands on it. Everything hits, from the soundtrack to Rocket's backstory, and the addition of the new antagonists Adam Warlock (played humourously by Adam Poulter) and The High Evolutionary (played to perfection by Chukwudi Iwuji).Without giving too much away, this film is an emotional ride from start to finish, one of the best films I've seen.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nufc_geordie","8 August 2023","GotG3 is the perfect mix of action, comedy, drama and Sci-Fi. It's also compelling emotionally however bizarre that maybe.Of all the movies in the MCU, the Guardians trilogy stands out for me because every installment has something the others don't, and that's heart. The cast is outstanding especially Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, and Dave Batista who is just brilliant in everything I've seen him do.This 3rd installment, as everything
in the MCU, has a ridiculous story and a lot of CGI but the true story behind all that is one of friendships, which we can all relate to. It does have a killer soundtrack and lots of laughs, which always helps. Highly recommended!","10/10"

The cast has been great throughout and I thought Bradley coppers voice acting was superb and it was really what made this movie.As for the villain!!!! Fantastic I hated him.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ha77y73ad97","2 August 2023","Theres been a few instances post Endgame that shows Marvel that they can create movies that are worthy of the title of an MCU movie. This is certainly one of them! Spider-man No Way Home/ Shang-chi are the only ones in my eyes that live up to the hype, story and all of the fantastic moments that have come before in the MCU.Many times over i've been reading about the emotional damage that this movie brings on long-term MCU fans and it certainly packs a punch. 4 experimental beings, broken and tutored are still able to find meaning in their captivity bring the audience to tears with story that ultimately leads Rocket to finding his new family by the end of the first Guardians movie. Theres moments where a look from a Raccoon to a Blue cyborg that melt your heart as for years they were the only surviving members during the blip. All members of team have their time to shine in this movie as we trek across the galaxy.One of the most glaring points that have come out of recent marvel movies is that the villains are sub par, even with such talented actors like Christian Bale to name one they are not able to save the villains. Could be poor writing, could be poor direction or down to the fact that many of these were worked on during covid but thats no excuse when films like the Batman are written, filmed and released during the covid years. The High Evolutionary on the other hand is one of those villains thats going to go down in the history of the MCU, deranged, calm and manic at the same time his scientific process of creating beings to just throw away steers away from the recent bunch that have to have a motive behind the actions. He's just a bad guy! Same as the Green Goblin who yet again is still a standout from 00s to Spider-man No Way Home! He rips animals apart and rebuilds them to how he sees them evolving in grotesque hybrids of metal and living tissue.Only reason that this is not the 10 out of 10 is because of Adam Warlock, when he first crashed down to Knowhere that was the Warlock i thought we were getting throughout the movie! I know that many characters need a starting point to grow from but maybe it was a bit to far back for his start up. The thought behind him was to be closer to Visions introduction as a being who isnt able to process emotion but can work with whoever his master was. Instead we got a baby warlock, far more emotionally unstable than calculation.Its a Trilogy that walks right up there to the top of Marvel, Antman would have been there as well if it wasnt for Quantomania. We still have Iron man, Cap and this to be thankful in a way to round off a trilogy that has been with us for nearly a decade. I wish James Gunn well on the DC front and if a triology of Superman films can come out as well as these then DC fans are going to be in for a treat.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ray115","6 May 2023","This was a Marvel movie I was waiting for a long time - no global universe conflict or multiverse problems. Just one definite problem to solve and to solve it well. You empathize with the characters and feel that every member of the group is important. The quality of the action is high, but this is not the main part - action just supports the storytelling and characters. Good work, James Gunn. Best actor nominee may sound strangely but I'd like to give it to the Rocket.Funny sayings and incidents accompany all the activities as is the trademark of the Guardians.Can't skip to mention the soundtrack - Radiohead, Beastie Boys, Bruce Springsteen and so on.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","eitaishiguro","3 May 2023","Sorry if my English is bad.It came out in May 3rd in Japan and we were blessed with this masterpiece a bit earlier than the US.As my review title states, perfect conclusion to the perfect trilogy. This is most definitely one of the best superhero trilogy of all time behind ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. I honestly think they have completely different style so it is impossible to simply compare them but there is no doubt that this movie is a masterpiece in its own way.Although I've watched every MCU movie, after ""Endgame"" they gradually became dull and boring to the point I was watching solely by a force of habit. But this movie completely changed everything. I had my hopes up high and it did not let me down.Must watch for any Marvel fans, James gunn fan and genuinely anybody in search for a fun entertaining flick although I would reccomend
you to at least watch the previous 2 movies of the trilogy.Amazing. Thank you James Gunn.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nemesis2000-2","6 August 2023","To be honest I am disappointed I did not get a chance to see this in theaters. Just finished on Disney+ Guardians 3 IS one of the best MARVEL films and IS the best MARVEL film since Endgame.The story expands on the Guardians even more and does it without the comedy aspect overpowering the base narrative. All while carrying a steady pace between story, action, etc. Sadly a lot of the phase 4 MARVEL films and TV series went the route of comedy over narrative, and it shows. Here Guardians 3 includes the emotional aspect where it not only sticks with you but also has the factor where you can re-watch and enjoy seeing those moments again. I go back to re-watching the MCU in phase 1 through 3, but Phase 4 I have little interest in re-watching with the exception of a couple TV series. This does include some sensitive material, and may not be for everyone. Sensitive material is hard to watch, overcoming it to see where it goes I feel is a reward in itself here and Gunn delivered.Guardians 3 feels like the MARVEL producers, higher ups did not heavily influence it and let James Gunn do his work. If you are looking to get that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania taste gone I HIGHLY suggest watching Guardians 3.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","hasheerghafoor","5 May 2023","The best MCU film since ""No Way Home"". This film was about everything I wanted it to be. It was very emotional and deep in a much different manner then I expected. I teared up more then once while watching this film. This is without a doubt the best looking MCU film in a while. The cinematography is amazing! The CGI/green screen is excellent! I didn't detect a single flaw with what they were able to achieve in that category. The action sequences were very well executed, especially one where all the Guardians are fighting together and it looks like it's all one take. The flashbacks involving Rocket's past were very difficult to watch. Very emotional and dark. What made it work really well was not the voice acting but how they made Rocket look and how they treated him. The stakes were never higher in any other Guardians movie but this, which made the intensity and emotions all pay mush well together. The humor worked very well, which can be hard for a film that is very emotional. James Gunn's direction and style made it all work. As for flaws, I found the villian weak as I couldn't connect with him whatsoever. I just didn't care about him and found him pretty useless. Will Poulter plays Adam Warlock and he's very good. It's just that the character is extremely underutilized. I thought there would be a lot of him in this film but there's actually not and they didn't really know what they were doing with him. There's also some plot holes where exposition was required in certain scenes, which is never a good thing. Besides that, this was a really good movie that I absolutely enjoyed from start to end. It's also very fast paced. This film moves and not a single scene drags. Is it the best Guardians movie? I don't think so but it's still up there and one of the better MCU films we've had as of late.Letter Grade: B+","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","mazbutt-16041","3 May 2023","This is what we get when you give a writer and director creative control. Someone who actually cares about the story of characters and it's produced a near perfect conclusion to the GOTG.The darker tone of the movie is set early on and it instantly raises the stakes, however James Gunn doesn't forget to let us have fun along the way. I laughed a bunch and of course there was some comedy that didn't quite hit. And also, action scenes were outstanding!Some scenes in this are certainly disturbing and make you uncomfortable but its necessary and very much adds depth to the story and characters. Rocket, you have my respect Sir. His backstory is absolutely brilliant, i wish there was more.The movie fan in me gives this a 10/10 but if im being critical, it's a 9/10. Adam Warlock felt like a wasted opportunity and he was just THERE. I don't think they really knew what to do with him. Gamora's character has become difficult to do anything with but I appreciate what they tried here.A near perfect conclusion to the Guardians. You'll definitely be missed.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TxMike","14 September 2023","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, the picture is remarkably good and the surround sound really does surround you. If you have a decent or better home theater set-up.While the movie does focus quite a lot on action and explosions, seemingly the kinds that no one could survive, for me the best parts of the movie are the quieter scenes, the ones where the focus is more on the characters and how they relate to each other.We get a back-story for Rocket and how he was created. How he surprised at his natural intelligence and wisdom. And as the movie moves along Rocket's life is in danger and the Guardians have to scramble to save him.As with the others in the series this is just a popcorn movie at its core. It is for entertainment and for that it does very well.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","slightlymad22","4 May 2023","I just got out of Guardians of The Galaxy 3I will say from the off, I didn't love it, like I did the first movie. I will say it's a very James Gunn movie and some of the jokes didn't land for me.. WOW is this dark. It will certainly be disturbing for some young kids.I was hoping for more Sly Stallone following on from his appearance in the last movie, but his screen time is about the same.There is a sequence in the middle, that totally took me out of the movie, and they do something I hate. But the third act pretty much sticks the landing, and it was emotional.Overall, what I liked, far outweighed what I didn't.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","browniesnack57","4 May 2023","This movie did its job with gusto. It obeyed the formula for each character in terms of their core personas and motivation. The story has a depth I honestly hardly expected from the chaotic mind behind this space saga.Peter was for once, not in focus, but that particular narrative justice is wholly justified within the plot. I have to put myself in a position to disagree with critics against the villain and his inherent evilness. There is but one criteria at play in the context of the Guardians. Healthy duality of crazy and defeatable. That's it, really.I will miss these discount Star Wars mascot freaks with my full raccoon heart.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Top_Dawg_Critic","5 May 2023","Of the three films, this one was the longest by far. I normally don't care how long a film is, as long as the story carries the runtime. But in this film's case, the story was dragged out with long and mostly unnecessary scenes. Much of the film was too much filler and not enough substance, and to make matters worse, most of that filler was overboard sappiness and cheesy dialogue with more misses than hits on the humor. It's like Gunn asked a bunch of fifth-graders to come up with the humor. That said, there were a few hits, but the infantile humor misses overshadowed the comedic moments that hit. Plus I felt the story wasn't as engaging as the first two instalments. Nevertheless, the S/VFX was outstanding, in abundance, and impressive, and the main reason for my generous 8/10, for a story and missed comedy that would've only deserved a 6/10.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","FKDZ","19 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is fitting and strong finale for a trilogy that managed to steal my heart. Putting on GoTG on a whim one day spiraled me into the next, and accompanying essential viewing namely Avengers Infinity war and Endgame. But none of them viewed on the big screen, until today, to top off the journey. This is adventure filled, funny and at times emotional and dark movie. There's something for everyone here. And I dare say it's even watchable for someone who hasn't seen a single marvel movie, because there are some short tit bits of info drops to either remind if you forgot, or to get you up to speed.Directing was fantastic. If I can describe it with one word it's: Dynamic. Maybe at times to a fault, with being to chaotic. I suffered only in one action scene from that but others complained a bit more. Personal taste. But there's so much creativity, not afraid to play with angles. One of the final fights (one take scene) is a joy to watch both in choreography and directing. I do have some gripes, I felt that the music and action scenes felt stronger in previous movies, not by much but it carried the music for longer and made the scene so much more fun. Here they tend to cut the music quickly. And moments just end a little too fast and don't get time to breathe.Story and characters, this isn't a useless trilogy, there's again real expansion on backstory and character progression. I love that the characters get a purpose, or find it. And we leave satisfied. The new side-villain teased in Vol.2 is alright, some good moments. But ultimately didn't live up that much to expectations. The main villain though, firstly, really well acted and a good villain overall. Also driven by his own madness, not just ''I want to take over the world'. No huge plot, but a plot that involved a important character. All characters are fantastic I just have no complaints really. Star Lord puts in the work, Drax is fun, Rocket is amazing. Groot is groot. The finale reminded me of Return of the Jedi, just how celebratory it was. It's a great way to really end a movie experience.Logic and stuff, well it's a fantasy movie so 99% of the unrealistic things I let slide. But if you are picky about that stuff you will notice. Personally I wasn't bothered.Music was great once again, another strong role in making this movie work and the trilogy. All good picks. Though as I said I felt like it was cut short sometimes. Whereas in previous movies it would really carry a scene for much longer.World design, production design. They went all out, from comedic designs to stunning interiors and areas. One of the reasons I love the GoTG trilogy so much is it's world. It feels classic, that kinda weird in-between of man with blue skin, woman with green skin. And full-on cgi monsters and weirdness. It also has that element of Star Wars and Star Trek in it. It just feels so good to watch a sci-fi world that is so creatively designed on a big screen.Whats next, who knows, the credits do tell us but I think it will be a while, or a different movie entirely. All I know is this trilogy was great. I enjoyed it a ton. The grade is mainly for nailing a trilogy. I'd say all 3 are very close together, with Vol.2 being a personal favorite for now.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","da-huber","9 August 2023","This is unfortunately one of the only few current MCU entries that was actually fun... in a way.The humor of the first two movies is still present. Some jokes are a bit cringey, others are really funny. The special effects are top notch, the retro soundtrack rocks and the interactions between the guadians will forever be entertaining.The villain however is really dull and the new Gamora just doesn't work for me. She's not a good replacement and her constant screaming in this oddly rough voice was laughable. Although this entry in the series was a fun ride it still doesn't compare to its two predecessors.All in all an ok sequel but it does seem like this should be the last one in the series.","2/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dasa108","18 May 2023","What a disappointing film. In two moments I was about to get up from the theater and leave. It had been a long time since I had seen such a pretentious film. It was a mistake to emphasize the relationships between the characters because the vast majority of them have irrational expectations and behavior; It was another mistake to put Rocket's drama as a catalyst for the film because the villain depends precisely on his relationship with Rocket and that makes any sense of danger disappear. The villain is unfortunately the weakest in Marvel history and he really looks like a jester. If you expect entertainment you will find a couple of moments to laugh (thanks to Mantis) and some interesting visuals. The rest can be said to be pretentious, unbearable, tedious and generally leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth. I rarely yelled at the good guys in a movie theater, Die!! Yesterday it happened This is not the way to make a worthy or valuable film. To put it simply: it's rubbish.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","0X4Two0","8 May 2023","Director Gunn brought his new film to our visual field. In my opinions, marvel entered a bust after Avengers 4. Many films and TV wanted to indicate political correctness but did not finish their inborn missions. However, Guardians of the galaxy volume 3 did all them well. Particularly Rocket's story made me touched. I thought maybe Rocket's characterisation was the first three in marvel universe. Comparing with other elder super heroes, director Gunn used less time to portray Rocket's context. But he still accomplished this task. Other characters in the movie were also described wonderful. Only Mantis' denouement was a little abrupt. Incidentally, Gunn's bad taste was somewhat barro indeed.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","mpgqc","10 May 2023","I'm a Guardians fan and MCU nerd and I didn't love this one. I'll watch it 85 more times I'm sure but it missed the mark with me on first watch. It's more violent and dark than the previous ones but I felt sucker punched for emotional gotchas, not substance. It felt rushed and strained credulity (even for a movie set in space with gadgets and creatures aplenty) somehow. Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind or sad that this is the final installment, plus the theater was crappy with poor sound. Hopefully upon rewatch I'll get on board.It was good to see the crew again and close the loop on some storylines. I definitely LOLed enough to embarrass my kids and the soundtrack was outstanding. It wasn't bad but it was a little bit of a letdown...","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dummy-15","2 November 2023","Vol 3 and yes it was the best of all. I mean the best of probably most of marvel movies.An absolutely fully entertaining, funny, emotional and fantastic movie. 2 and 30 minutes and you do not get bored at all. Great action, great lines and the backstory of Rocket had me in tears almost on every scene.The one were where he opens the cage with his species had me sobbing, what a wonderfull execution of emotion and action.A big kudos to that fella Nathan Fillion, i do not think he can say no to any proposal, even if he is to play a talking head. That shows he is the most cool actor of his generation.If you wanna cry if you wanna laugh or care for fight scenes this movie has it all.Whas that Howard the Duck ????","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","CelluloidConnoisseur","5 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fantastic film that stands out as the best of the series. Director James Gunn manages to combine sweetness with viciousness to create a well-rounded movie that is both exciting and emotional. Despite the film being a bit overstuffed, it still provides a refreshing break from the post-Endgame slump in the franchise.Gunn's sadistic side is prominently featured in the movie, and it adds a layer of depth to the characters and storyline. However, the film is not without its flaws. It is a messy finale that can feel aimless at times, and the heavy themes of loss and terror can make it an odd, lumbering patchwork of a film.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an excellent addition to the series and a must-watch for fans of the films. It may not be for everyone, especially animal lovers, comic book fans, and those who are sticklers for narrative continuity, but for those who are open-minded and willing to take a chance on a unique movie, this is a film worth seeing.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","SnoopyStyle","15 May 2023","Peter Quill is depressed after losing his Gamora. The Guardians of the Galaxy are living in Knowhere when out of the blue, a golden warrior attacks it. Rocket is left near death and the only way to save him is to return to the beginning of his story. He and many others were the High Evolutionary's experiments in his mad quest for a superior society.The gang is back, but it's not as much fun. Peter is sad and then angry. Gamora is way angrier. Rocket's origin story is brutal. This series of movies has been more fun and ridiculous than other MCU. This is coming after some very crushing emotional journeys. It's an inflection point where this series needs to build itself back up. There are going to be some changes. Some are known to be leaving. This sequel still has its brand of humor, but the serious stuff is just more sad and more serious. I would like to throw a few more jokes especially with the Peter and Gamora story. I don't know why they try to ship Peter and Nebula, but that scene needs a joke. Nebula should definitely call Peter ugly or fat or pale or all of the above. I don't know what will Mantis do without Drax. This is supposed to be the end of a trilogy. Whatever comes next, I hope it's sillier and a lot more stupider.","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","gdkvgf","6 May 2023","I'm not quite sure how a franchise that has knocked it out of the park to date (with one exception) could've messed up the formula this badly.Maybe I should've paid more attention to the writing on the wall after that one Christmas Special miss, but I just assumed that project was an easy paycheck and not a directional change.GotG3 starts weirdly and is super choppy throughout. On paper, the High Evolutionary storyline should've worked, but they spend far too much time away from it. The way they shoehorned Adam Warlock into the movie was almost criminal for a character that important.There's a lot more, but I don't want to accidentally do a spoiler review.It wasn't bad. But the flaws are so hard to ignore that I left the theater disappointed. If you're being honest, you did to.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Ed-from-HI","8 May 2023","WOW = Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is most certainly one of the very best Marvel movies ever produced (and that is saying a lot considering how impressive those recent Avengers and Black Panther films have been) but G of G volume 3 amazingly provides even more entertainment value and enjoyment containing all the expected irreverent humor & camaraderie + ultra-Cosmic action as before but with an extra-added dose of pathos and poignancy (inherent to Rocket Raccoon's intriguing origin Story) enhanced by a First-Rate Science fiction scenario featuring the 'High-Evolutionary' and Adam Warlock ( back in the Day when I seriously collected Marvel Comics many years ago, I always eagerly sought out any issues with appearances by Adam Warlock since he was one of Marvel's most profound, complex & conflicted characters.... and the High-Evolutionary comic stories never failed to fascinate).Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 perfectly blends all elements above and allows each Team member's uniquely eccentric strength (and humorously endearing misfit shortcomings) to be utilized to the fullest extent and perfectly incorporated into the overall proceedings. I was really surprised by how emotionally resonant Rocket Raccoon's origin Story is....... the scenes of Rocket 'bonding' and finding genuine compassion from the other intelligent, mutated-misfit, accelerated feral-creatures/ products of the High-Evolutionary's brutal experimentation, was so heartfelt and moving at times it was hard to believe these were CGI and not real breathing-living beings with actual Souls..... the voice and motion-capture actors should be nominated for Academy awards since their expressed emotions appeared so genuine!To balance the poignancy of Rocket's story the other Guardians especially Mantis, Nebula, Drax the Destroyer and Groot have a lot of characteristically idiosyncratic moments that are hilarious and help maintain the balance of 'light & dark' between the intervals of Fantastic action sequences. Another important note is that G of G Vol. 3 has some of the most Creative Starship designs and futuristic (and even psychedelic) technological concepts... some of the most impressive I have ever seen! To Top it all off the side-story of Quill/Star-Lord trying to emotionally re-connect with Gamora keeps the audience guessing all the way thru.... and the progression of that scenario although not what might be expected is still satisfying, nonetheless.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is highly-recommended, if I had one minor reservation it would be that I wish Adam Warlock could have embodied more of the complexity and profound depth of characterization from the original comics (especially the version augmented by Jim Starlin in the mid to late 1970's) but I am most certain Adam Warlock will appear in some future Marvel scenario since he has almost infinite story potential! I kind of hope the High-evolutionary will also return in some future form..... since these characters (along with the Silver Surfer) + the Guardians of the Galaxy (of course) really exemplify Cosmic Marvel Science-Fiction at it's very Best and most intriguing!","4/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cashmere-12","9 May 2023","Don't understand the great reviews. Found this last movie the worst of the series. It was depressing and dark. People were actually walking out. Even the music was awful compared to the other 2 movies.There was no humour or laugh out loud parts. You would think they would want to go out on a high.Stallone was a bit of fresh air. The ending was okay. The best part when Peter returned to Earth at the end. The rest of the cast was a fill in there moments.Well a night out for Popcorn that was about it cause the movie didn't live up to the previous ones. Went out like a whimper nothing special.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ufster-2","8 August 2023","Aside from the usual Marvel formula of bantering camaraderie, heroic sacrifice, this movie tries to explore, both emotionally and intellectually, a basic idea of rights and worth, so far as life itself is concerned.At one point in the movie, angered by Nebula's shoving of Drax, Mantis screams ""You have no right to push him"" before she goes off to scold her for failing to understand that the worth of a life isn't measured on a scale of intellect or utility (competence).""It's all for a purpose""... At the beginning of the movie we see defenseless animals being tortured, killed and discarded like some lab equipment since this supposedly served a higher purpose of helping more worthy creatures to exist. There's no sugar coating here, it's what we do on a daily basis to many animals we arbitrarily decide have lesser worth thus should/could be used in service of higher life forms such as ourselves.It should come as no surprise, but with a thick odor of hypocrisy, that we see the poor Soviet dog (Cosmo based on the real life counterpart Laika) sent to her horrible death with the perfectly acceptable excuse that it served the advancement of mankind, much like the tens of thousands of animals tortured in much worse ways in the collective west up until that day.At the end, we see the arbitrary line of worthiness move towards much uncomfortably humanoid life forms as it has happened following the breakthrough years of the so-called enlightenment, the greater good of the selected few always being the go-to excuse of those with the power to inflict damage and destruction.The native americans, aboriginal peoples all had to make way to the ""superior"" white man in its quest for advancement and perfection. In this sense, the emotionally charged yet superficial exploration of animal rights begs a really important question.If we aren't to have any moral qualms over imposing our dominance over lesser beings on the grounds that they are ""less"" of what we deem worthy, what is the point of stopping at other human beings with similar characteristics for simply being classified as part of our species? There seems to be no objective line that could be crossed in this pursuit if this argument is to be accepted.Laika was a stray dog someone strapped on to a spacecraft, primarily because they could and because they deemed it to be necessary for the advancement of Soviet civilization. In the absence of a Laika, or in the instance that human subjects are easier and more reliable, I'm sure even any western nation pretending to be for human rights and individual freedom wouldn't hesitate to come to a similar conclusion. Oh right they have, many times... Tuskagee syphilis experiments, the American nuclear guinea pigs, countless other instances of psychological abuse in the name of experimentation, the list is endless.I hope this movie serves as a mainstream device of at least getting people to notice the very obvious link between treating animals as convenient utilities and treating humans as such. For all our pretentious moralistic grandstanding disguised in our fake self-righteous outrage, the intelligent among us realize there is no objective difference.","1/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sye-88095","9 May 2023","As a big fun of Guardian franchise, I have to say this one is boring, annoying, and unnecessarily childish. I just wish to get out the theater halfway through the movie. Maybe the animal protection theme is the reason why it is rated so high. The movie can be easily made into a 90 minutes version. The constant shouting and anger serve no purpose but to annoy audiences. The comedy is at least two grades down from the previous series. To be fair, I think this one should be rated about the same as the latest Thor movie at around 6.5. But since so many people give such absurd high rating, I feel the need to balance it.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","stevendbeard","6 May 2023","I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, starring Chris Pratt-the Jurassic World movies, The Magnificent Seven_2016; Chukwudi Iwuji-Designated Survivor_tv, John Wick: Chapter 2; Will Poulter-Midsommar, We're the Millers; Zoe Saldana-the Avatar movies, the Star Trek movies and the voice of Bradley Cooper-A Star is Born_2018, the Hangover movies.This is the third and final Guardians movie, at least with this group of characters-there will be more Guardians movies, just with a different line up. Chris/Star_lord is trying to get over the death of Zoe from the Avengers Endgame movie when he learns that she is still be alive but has no memory of their time together. Will/Adam Warlock shows up, looking for Bradley/Rocket, and in the attempt to capture him, Bradley is badly injured. Will was sent by Chukwudi/The High Evolutionary for Bradley and during flashbacks, you learn more about Bradley's past and Chukwudi's experiments on Bradley and other unfortunate souls. This is a great send off for this group of Guardians. Lots of good action and fight scenes, a few cameos, lots of humor and there are 2 scenes at the end. One just as the end credits start-with a preview of the new line up-and one at the very end that shows a reunion for a character.It's rated PG-13 for violence, language and drug references and has a running time of 2 hours & 30 minutes.I really enjoyed this installment and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","6/10"

Having seen it, I'm still not quite sure how I feel.The film is better than evrything else, film or TV, released ovwr phase 4 and 5. But still I found myself disappointed. The jokes, the constant arguing, the weird flesh planet... It all just tired me out this time.Rockets storyline does its best to save this movie, but with a very messy ending and too many random moments, it wasnt enough for me to enjoy it. He is the only character they seemingly cared to write a decent storyline for, everyone else feels like theyre just there by obligation.And Adam Warlock..... Dear lord.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","onxpii","15 May 2023","I honestly dont get why i seem to be the only one who didnt think this movie was good especially being in a trilogy with 2 other great movies. It makes me wonder if others just like it because they have been so deprived of good marvel movies for these past 2 years or so. Yes, people are right when they say its one of the best marvel movies since endgame, but other than spiderman no way home, all other competition is bad cinema that isnt hard to beat.First of all, I didn't like that the medpacks were just now introduced. I dont remember ever seeing them before and I think they put them in just to have plot armor for every main character except rocket, just to what, enhance the already high stakes? We dont need to be spoon-fed the fact that rocket is in danger, we couldve completely understood that without it. Its pretty obvious that it is just a useless plot tool so the the writers can be lazy and have characters get into fights with no consequence on their health to be able to do another one right after. If youre going to write a story where you dont have time to include any injuries or deaths, then just dont let them get hurt in the first place??Secondly, since the main villain had these incredible powers capable of stopping all his guards who were pointing guns at him ready to shoot. If he was so powerful, how was he not able to stop the guardians when he confronted them? It seemed like he wasnt using the full potential of his power because the movie was already too long and the lazy predictable plot just HAD to have all the heroes beat him right? This is not the only time the plot has problems with lazily crunching important moments into a smaller timeframe; it can also be observed in the last few scenes where Quill is about to die then is saved in seconds and is COMPLETELY UNHARMED 1 MINUTE LATER! This could have been a sad death scene to naturally end an era, but no, they just had to add this for no reason just for him to end up leaving for earth anyways with his happy ending hero story because thats what always happens!!Finally, the villain is so one-sided, predictable, flat, and provokes no thought or moral conflict in the viewers minds at all whatsoever. It does not challenge your point of view on anything at all. Heroes good villain bad, hurt animal bad, hero always win. Marvel should know we are not little kids judging by the fact that they put in the F bomb and very disturbing scenes of animal cruelty. So, if marvel knows we can be adult enough for that, why are we not adult enough for a story that actually breaks the mold and makes the audience think?In conclusion, yes this movie was good for PHASE 4 (the worst phase ever!!) That does not mean it deserves to be called the best MCU movie by a lot of people. I really think people are overhyping it because they have been so deprived of above horrible content for so long that they think this is somehow a ""masterpiece"" in any way. They introduce new concepts as a lazy fix for their plot holes, make the villain not show his full power just for the point that the hero must always win even if it shouldnt be that easy, and show problems in the world (animal cruelty) without provoking any thought or change in perspective about it into the minds of the viewers at all. People need to take a step back from the hype and realize that hidden behind the tear-jerker backstory of Rocket is a movie that is objectively JUST AVERAGE...thank you for your time.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dannytk-81184","7 May 2023","James Gunn delivers yet again in the MCU!!This is easily the best movie from marvel since No Way Home, the way you are constantly on the edge of your seat hoping nothing bad is going to happen to your favourite characters, one minute your laughing and the next your literally fighting back tears, all done in typically beautiful James Gunn fashion.This is a fitting end for the guardians and rounds the trilogy off beautifully, I loved every moment of this emotional rollercoaster and to be honest it was almost as good as the first instalment, I hope to see the guardians again in the future but only if James Gunn is at the helm.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jackgdemoss","9 May 2023","I remember telling a buddy in 2019 that reviewing Marvel films is strange because it is nearly impossible for them to score below an 8/10 for me. A 7/10 is the average score I give and very few films in phases 1-3 dipped down to there. 4 years later, I am just happy that a Marvel film finally made what I thought their bare minimum was. Although the movie can be messy and tone deaf, it does not have a cringey agenda and is centered around a sub plot that has a lot of heart. It is not quite the send off these characters deserve but it is definitely the best they will get given the direction Marvel has gone and the lack of hype surrounding the property in 2023.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jmforsyth-33291","5 May 2023","Writing this right after a first viewing and I must say something I haven't said much about Marvel films post-Endgame (minus Spiderman: No Way Home). I want to watch it again.You'll notice a tonal change between this and previous instalments. This one is darker (parents may want to view by themselves before bringing along their younger Marvel fans to see if they can handle it), the jokes aren't as frequent or as funny, and there are some more mature themes front and centre right from the first scene onward.And yet, so much of the familiar fun things you would expect are also present too. I won't say more about this for the sake of keeping this spoiler free.I wouldn't say this is my favourite GOTG film but that is not to say it is a bad film at all; it is more a testament to how highly I think of this trilogy as a whole and the care that was put into all three films. James Gunn loves these characters and you can really tell. I'm happy we can officially call this a great trilogy start to finish.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sbweightman","5 May 2023","A fantastic last ride for the Guardians with a film with pretty much everything you could want in it and which delivers on all fronts. The plot is simple but has a lot going on and manages to be light hearted and emotionally poignant with both massive and personal stakes. Each character gets their own chance to shine and the acting is top notch with a villain whose motives are authentic yet flawed. The special effects are superb with every scene filled with odd characters, colourful settings and weird alien-ness and the action scenes are fast paced, frequent and involving. Some scenes do go on a bit long and it does feel a bit like a music video at times due to the heavy use of music, but none of the scenes felt unnecessary and the music was great. It knows when to be fun, when to be serious, when to be funny with frequent jokes and when to bow out.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sujanfaster","8 May 2023","Most of the MARVEL movies post Avengers: Endgame have always lacked a bit of familiarity. A lot of factors like the introduction of new characters, concepts and new world building have contributed to the same. In the midst of all these chaos, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 brings a back that feeling of MARVEL which we were always hooked on to (see what I did there ;-))This movie was surrounded by controversies before its release due to the firing and rehiring of the franchise's mastermind director James Gunn. While James Gunn was working on it he was also parallely working on DC projects and he also took up a major role in DC recently. This has had me worried along with some of the MARVEL fans about his commitment towards the project. The way the Guardians get paired with Thor at the end of Avengers: Endgame I expected them to be a major part of the movie Thor Love and Thunder, but that wasn't the case. Even the Guardians' portrayal in that film kind of had us worrying on whether the MARVEL had lost that portrayal. But as soon as I saw the first trailer of GoTG Vol 3, I breathed a sigh of relief. The movie does exactly what it's promised in its trailer, that is, delivering on the emotional quotient along with a high octane fun ride.As seen in the trailer this story majorly involves around Rocket while also diving deep into the inner purpose of the individual characters. Even though the movie is almost 2h and 30 min long it doesn't seem too chaotic or also diverting anywhere from the main plot. There are some emotional flashback episodes which are very endearing to watch but I felt that they could have been placed more effectively. The action and action set pieces are on point and not a pain to watch unlike some of the recent MARVEL ventures. The movie excels in its production design department as always with a great play around colours. The music and background score for GoTG franchise has always been on point and this movie is no different.In case you haven't observed, one of James Gunn's strengths is his characters in movies. He has a very strong backstory to his main characters and for some of his side characters he provides cool, wacky and memorable moments. One can see the shades of Peacemaker and his Suicide Squad reboot in some of the characters' design in this movie. As highlighted before, this story majorly revolves around Rocket and we get to experience some great emotions through Rocket's POV in this film. Kudos to Bradley Cooper yet again for delivering a special performance. This makes you almost forget that the Rocket is voiced by a human, such is the integration. Chris Pratt's role as Starlord kind of starts shakily in this movie but picks up later to and gets a satisfying arc. Drax, Nebula and Mantis' roles are also quote high on emotions. While Groot has some cool moments in the movie, we don't really get to see the innocent fun which we had seen in the first 2 parts. Special mention to Sean Gunn's Kraglin role and performance, especially in the climax (I am not gonna reveal anything but I almost teared up in one of those scenes). I believe there has been a bit of talk about Adam Warlock's portrayal about how that character hasn't been utilized as per the comics. While I feel that role could have been written better, I also understand the restrictions in expanding that role because of movie's length. Zoe Saldana as the 'new Nebula' brings a different perspective and chemistry with the Guardians in this movie. Chukwudi Iwuji's antagonist character as The High Evolutionary is intense and fearsome but somehow misses the charm of a good MARVEL villain.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is definitely one of MARVEL's very few best post the Avengers: Endgame. I personally liked it better than the Spiderman: No Way Home. It is a great nostalgic treat to the MARVEL fans.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","thewalkingpuns","21 January 2024","I've always thought, since 2014 when gotg first started, that it was worthy of a trilogy. The wise cracks, the characters the music and the Stella cast combined make it such an enjoyable film all the way through. The guardians now have a new headquarters, in the giant skull of a guardian giant. The team plan on getting gamora to rejoin them and in doing so something happens to rocket and so we get some interesting flashbacks, the show his life and how he came to be and the horrible experiments done to him and others. The guardians also have to contend with the guy that did the experiments and the new utopia that he has tried to create. As always great acting all around. It's nice to have the guardians back, plus the extras that now may join them. It's an emotional end to the trilogy and a great soundtrack to accompany it. Overall a very fun film and i hope Gunn can spin his hand at more fun.","10/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Tvrus","14 September 2023","Hands down one of the greatest marvel films of all time. This movie is one of the most touching and heart wrenching experiences I've ever had in a theater. The character depth we see and enter in rocket is absolutely masterful. Getting to explore his heartbreaking backstory was spectacular but also painful at the same time. James Gunn is truly a master at building perfect ideology's for these characters. And even though this film is very sad at times it still holds a lot of fun comedy. Now it may seem that I love this film a whole lot and I do, but there is a lot of messy things about it, for example this film carry's numerous plot wholes and many moments that feel very dragged out. However the film's incredible peaks and highs saves this film from being anything under a 9/10. Overall I loved this film and I 100% recommend it to everyone.","1/10"

The start of the movie is very very slow but then the whole plot is just bad and not funny. The actors are okish. The main bad character is really good. I'm very disappointed as really enjoyed part 1 and 2. The plots is bad from the beginning to the end and very predictable. Was checking my watch every few minutes as couldn't wait for the end.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","matthewwongsc","3 May 2023","I cannot stress how absolutely ecstatic to say that there may just be hope for Marvel. It's true what critics say when it's the best thing since Endgame. An absolutely magnificent roller-coaster of action, story and emotion. There is a huge ensemble cast with several newcomers to the franchise, which have have been mostly well balanced in their introductions, although can leave a little more to be desired. However our returning Guardians all have wonderful stand-out moments throughout, and Gunn's love for the characters and storytelling really shine. A great last hurrah to the Guardians of the Galaxy, and a definite must-watch for every single Marvel fan!P. S. I love that James Gunn gave a special thanks ""To the fans!"" in the end credits.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","trinaboice","1 November 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
I'm a HUGE fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, so I've been looking forward to this grand finale. It pains me to even acknowledge that this is the last film in this series. Say it isn't so, James Gunn! He wrote and directed the film. At the beginning of the film, we see the lights turn off in Quill's bedroom, illustrating that James Gunn is putting this trilogy to bed. But surely, Marvel won't really retire this hugely successful part of the MCU, right???Here's how the studio describes this final installment: In Marvel Studios ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.THINGS I LIKED:
The fantastic cast includes our fan favorites: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Kementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter, Sylvester Stallone, Elizabeth Debicki, and more!The beginning of the movie starts on a sad, serious note, something I wasn't expecting.Lots of creative set pieces.Gunn does a great job blending tense action scenes with humor and heart.We get to find out Rocket Raccoon's origin story. Awwww...
It is said that many of the songs in the film are diegetic, which means the characters can hear the music.The song that opens and closes the trilogy is ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone. Sweet.Keep watching during the rolling credits at the end of the movie for another cute scene that references Kevin Bacon.As always, the soundtrack is terrific. The rest of the music by John Murphy was excellent.The story is extremely emotional. You WILL cry.We get a few short cameo performances from a few past characters. Yay! No spoilers!I always love the slow-motion action sequences. So entertaining.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie definitely assumes that you already know and love the characters, and understand how the Guardians' universe works. If you haven't seen any of the Guardians movies, you should absolutely not start with this one. Start from the beginning.Too many of the costumes and sets look like costumes and sets: more design than magic. In fact, this movie sets a new record for the most prosthetics (23,000) used on over 1000 actors.I wish the voice of Cosmo, the Spacedog, were different. It sounds too much like Mantis' character. The female voice by Maria Bakalova was used to pay tribute to Laika, the Russian dog who was one of the first animals in space.There are way too many characters to keep track of in this final installment.So much yelling.The movie is messy with tonal changes.There are a lot of flashbacks that might confuse the timeline for some viewers.Ultimately, I wanted more. Because I'm such a fan of the franchise, I really wanted to be blown away but wasn't. Were you? I need to see it again.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Some profanity and crude conversations, including an F-bomb
Violence
People and creatures die
Lots of destruction.!","9/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","tristanmilesheap","6 May 2023","Writing this as it's scoring arguably too highly at the moment and I don't want others big fans of the franchise to go in with high expectations that don't get met.The film is not nearly as good as the original, or even as good as the second. However, the closing 20 minute sequence is great, there's another nice soundtrack, and Rocket's story is the highlight of the film.The bad: the humour really doesn't hit anymore. There was flags in GOTG 2, but it all together doesn't work here. The same is true for the writing, it's not quite the same level.I also can't help but feel the magic is slightly gone. The original was something we loved that we didn't know we wanted, it just isn't recaptured here. It's also just quite a messy film, so much CGI of strange concept creatures and places that focus on quantity rather than quality.In my perspective, it's a continuation of the Phase 4 mediocreness that just can't capture the special something the Infinity Saga movies often had.","4/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","filmtravel101","10 May 2023","I'm a big fan of GOTG 1+2 and thought this film would be an exciting experience but almost half of our group all agreed it was a flop of a disaster.The length of 2.5 hours was way too long for this bizarre Raccoon Rocket origin story that towards the end got so demented with the animal cruelty and Noah's arc analogy that it makes one wonder if James Gunn was smoking peyote or on some Amazonian Ayahuasca trip while writing it during Covid.It's a basic story that really lacks continuity and good storytelling and feels like a variety of music videos of best characters of GOTG tossed in with simple plot to save Rocket life - but instead it feels like a comical rescue relief that is endlessly pathetic - and the final ending kumbayah hugging fest says it all - and the only one that sees the entire film as a flop disaster is our green character Zoraya.What was James Gunn smoking ?We all felt like the villain crew that turned and mutinied against their stretched black faced villain leader - which is a good reference to how we all feel towards James Gunn destroying a great series with such a pathetic distorted story. Mutiny should have stopped this piece of garbage at the Marvel studio.Oh and most of the cgi is terrible unless you like Honey I shrunk the kids type of cgi - and the sound track was 50/50 missing it's mark compared to the last 2 films that were master pieces compared to this mangled motley of cringing sentimental garbage.Kudos to the space dog and please do not continue with any more.Looking forward to new films from James GunnPs o idea how anyone can give this film a 9/10 score4 stars and that is being generous.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","b_shaker333","7 May 2023","This is why you don't see many good movies anymore... this is why the Golden era of film is the 70's... 90's... and some big franchises came out in like the 80's.Because companies and their distributors get too afraid with ballooning movie budgets, and it creates a too many cooks in the kitchen atmosphere.And movie studios are just too nervous to take a risk, or they just make the same crap because it's guaranteed to make money.There is no art, there is no love or passion. It's just cold calculated money, and that's it.There's a reason there aren't many new generation directors... and even if there are talented people... they pretty much all do television. Because of control.This movie is BY FAR and away the best movie in the series... and the best Marvel movie... probably ever. And the reason is they just let the director do his thing. And it works... it will always work if that's what they do.But they rarely do... and this movie is proof positive what happens if the big wigs with no talent just step back and allow the artists to create art. Like they used to... in the 70's... some 80's... and the 90's. Thank you for a trip down memory lane James Gunn... DC should be in good hands... Disney is a bunch of morons.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","John_T_Chance","9 May 2023","Man ... the 100% truth is that they delivered a decent film yet it feels greater than its parts because Marvel Studios has been so lost and so poor since Endgame. Too little too late unfortunately. Box office aside, the movie plays exactly like a curtain call. Self indulgent but insisted upon by an appreciative audience. This sequel is not great, predictable and cliched but it all works. When a pleasant 7/10 movie feels massively refreshing then you know the bar isn't just low, it is on the ground. Overall, it's a fun and a worthy end. Take a bow folks because it's now officially all over for the MCU.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","DoctorDragon","8 May 2023","It's all about Rocket. That was a thing I never expected from this movie and I'm so happy about it. It was the most emotional and sad Marvel movie ever! Rocket's backstory is so dark and cruel that it's impossible not to cry buckets. From the start this movie felt defferent, with a threat never so high of characters dieing.In the end...nobody from the og team died. But is this a bad thing? No. The ending works fine exactly because of this. Instead of a funeral, similar to the second movie, we get a family ""split"". The child going out of home to live it's own life.This is such a beautiful message.I don't even have to talk about the music score...come on...it's magnificent.And the movie itself feels so organic, with drama alternating to comedy alternating to action.Such a great movie!!One last thing, the best quote from the movie: ""You didn't want to make things perfect, you just hated things the way they are."" ~Rocket Raccoon.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Benjamin-M-Weilert","21 September 2023","Ever since the original Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), it felt like this corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was left to do its own thing. These movies didn't have many cameos or connections to the larger MCU except for introducing characters who fought in the Avengers films. Perhaps because of this level of separation from the core MCU, the Guardians of the Galaxy movies have felt more stable tonally than the rest of the MCU films. You can probably thank James Gunn for that.While I consider the first Guardians movie to be one of the best superhero (or even sci-fi) films ever made, Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 (2017) diving into Peter Quill's (Chris Pratt) origins wasn't quite up to snuff. And while Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 (2023) is another origin story, it felt more impactful than its predecessor. After all, the one character of the group we didn't have any in-depth background on was Rocket (Bradley Cooper). This film remedies that in a way that's both emotional and a fitting cap on the adventures of the original Guardians group.In the post-Endgame MCU, movies like this feel rare. Sure, there's room for more adventures for this new group of Guardians, but wrapping up character arcs is a much more impressive feat. Letting things come to a natural end without forcing any hints of the next tie-in or cameo was refreshing. The villain also felt unique but threatening. It was also nice to get a more realistic resolution to the relationship between Peter and Gamora (Zoe Saldana)-kind of like at the end of Broadcast News (1987). Overall, the Guardians films are great by themselves, which Volume 3 epitomizes.A fitting and distinct wrap-up for the original Guardians, I give Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 4.0 stars out of 5.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nakrugt","4 May 2023","The first Guardians of the Galaxy movie was a surprise for the audience who were bored with the Marvel formula. It was fresh, it was fun, it was silly (in a good way). It was shocking.The chemistry among the characters was amazing, and we should be honest, that chemistry among did much of the heavy lifting in the second film, from which I do not remember much.With phase four, I was shocked how bad the writing was in each and every project - except for Spider-Man No Way Home. The rest was trash. That mentality left me concerned for the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3. I was afraid to see our beloved characters disrespected. Happily, I was wrong.There are plot holes, yes, but everything considered, it is fun to watch. Each and every character is given enough screen time for character development, which was non-existent in MCU phase 4. The flashbacks - a stale way to tell a story though it may be- work in the movie: we see the story of Rocket, and his origins. Is it a bit clisch√©? Yes, but it works.Nebula, I think, is amazing, too. They finally do justice with her in this film.You may not like the ending, they play a bit safe, but at least we leave the cinema with some optimism for each character in their own individual journeys.And yes, I think I am going to watch it again.Edit: After watching for the 5th time, why not nominating Chris Pratt for Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role?","2/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","eddie_baggins","5 May 2023","With a long time coming F-bomb, multiple scenes that are likely to make the kidlets (and more than its fair share of adults) cry and a direct reference to meth, Guardians of the Galaxy is most definitely back for one more team adventure delivered under the watchful eye of new DC cinematic universe maestro James Gunn who ensures that this Marvel series with a difference is able to go out on its own terms in this current format and in turn save the MCU from a string of dire to forgettable outings that have plagued the company since their Avenger's saga concluded with Endgame.Never more desperate for a feature that critics, audiences and box office results all were in favor for in unison since the dawn of the whole operation with 2008's Iron Man, the MCU should be thankful they allowed Gunn back behind the helm after showing him the door due to past misdemeanor's as Gunn and his cast clearly love working with one other and ensure that their shared love for their characters and the world they are a part of is one show here once more with Volume 3 of the Guardian's universe likely to please all that have enjoyed the prior two outings that have surprised all with their public affection and money making abilities.Arguably more serious minded in many respects, with Gunn not afraid to enter into some seriously dark and twisted territory across Volume 3's two and half hour runtime, it's nice to once more watch a MCU feature that feels entirely removed in most instances from previous events or trying to set up future mash-ups, team-up's or potential threats and in staying focused on itself Gunn is able to juggle the films heavy, light and playful tones to good effect, making this epic adventure one that never stays down for too long as we are carried across various set pieces and emotional undertakings.Using his same oddball charm and keen eye for visuals that have worked for him in the past both here and with his underappreciated Suicide Squad from the Covid-19 landscape, Gunn gives Marvel some of its best bang for buck moments in many a moon.Often backed by another rip-roaring soundtrack full of old school and more modern day jams, if audience's have paid the ticket price wanting to be entertained by spectacle and inventiveness they will get it here, while others wanting heart too go along with it all will be equally pleased (with Rocket's key backstory and arc playing a major role here), as will those more refined folk that perhaps just wanted to see a telekinetic dog or a brash golden boy in the form of Will Poulter's Adam Warlock cause some havoc along the way.Uninterested in messing with the formula or Marvel DNA like it arguably did with its first outing in 2014, Volume 3 leaves the series on a high note if many of the cast and crew decide to stick to their word and move on from what they started those many moons ago, succeeding against the odds and if this is indeed the last time we see this particular group of misfits, miscreants and outcasts on screen in this way, there's solid evidence to suggest that Gunn's three Marvel films are the most consistent of all of Marvel's properties in the cinematic cannon.Final Say -Rollicking along at a good pace across its substantial runtime and combining heart, laughter and spectacle together with a cast that are all seasoned and energetic professionals, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a (seemingly) fitting swansong to this ragtag crew that the world has understandably fallen in love with.4 mismanaged interrogations out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","8/10"

The last marvel movies doesn't really have directors and editors. They have been replaced by AI.Love And Thunder, felt like an incoherent fever dream.Ant-Man Quantumania, felt like an incoherent fever dream.Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3, felt like an incoherent fever dream.Not completely unlike the result you get when asking ChatGPT write a story.I loved GotG 1 and 2. And most of Gunns previous work.Number 3 was... what the hell am I watching?Did Gunn really do this? I know he can do better.It's gotta be cut together with AI right?It's either that, or Gunn has lost his passion and gotten lazy or tired of pursuing his usual quality.It feels like watching a long trailer with no narrative weight at all.Nothing feels important. People die and come back like nothing.Sometimes people can survive in the vacuum of space, sometimes not, depends on what is needed of the story or if it's an important character.No coherence. The pacing is insanely fast. Emotional scene, yes very sad. SMASH CUT! Running and shooting!The iconic classic music does not fit at all to what happens in the movie, people even dance out of rhythm.There are ""funny scenes"" injected here and there with no thought, even when it does not make sense. The comedy is just forced this time around.Even acting was pretty bland. They didn't even try with the voice acting for young Rocket. At least Quill and Gamora had some chemistry.Ugh.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","demonblade-37792","8 May 2023","The first impressions of Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 gave me more emotions considering it is the last of the trilogy. It gave me laughter because the jokes were funnier compared to other Marvel movies. It gave me more sadness because there were parts where I thought a certain character that dies. This is also Rocket Raccoon's origin story because it will go more of in depth of how he will learn how to talk and learn more from Rocket's creators. James Gunn did a great job on ending GOTG considering he will move onto DC. The acting by everyone was amazing that makes the viewer feels all type of emotions from laughter to sadness. The cinematography is visually stunning, from the CGI and special effects, that makes you feel that you were in another universe. Lastly, the action was great from the Guardians that made the viewer want more fights. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is great with its acting, cinematography, action, and the story. I would recommend to watch it in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","kdam-850-667617","22 May 2023","How is this the most highly rated GOTG Movie!??Apart from Rockets backstory this was utter garbage. Predictable, Irrational garbage. I literally walked out of the cinema! I couldn't even finish it. I'm sorry but since the last Avengers movie all the Marvel films have been terrible!!! Predictable, Childish and lazy writing throughout (Dr Strange 2, Thor L&T etc...).What the hell were those stupid, mutated, pig flesh security costumes about at the weird fleshy space station and why did they just aimlessly barrel into every ""Immensely dangerous, impenetrable"" fortress without a plan and just happen to make it through... I get that this is a superhero movie but come on, at least try and make some sense!!They will never have another penny of my money!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cherold","31 July 2023","GOTG has been the funniest and most rambunctious part of the MCU, so it's a little startling when the third movie begins with Rocket's deeply disturbing backstory, told in increasingly dark flashbacks as the Guardians try to save Rocket from imminent death.This bummer component takes the fun down a notch, but there's still a lot of humor and action, and the series is still able to keep the characters believable among the nonsense, which makes up for storytelling that sometimes ignores the fine points of telling us what's going on.This is very much an end-of-an-era film, and GOG3 does a good job at wrapping things up in a satisfying fashion. I have seen many movies spend a tedious 20 minutes of gauzy nostalgia for characters I don't care about, but this movie keeps it short and fun, giving each character a good send off without getting maudlin.While the first two were seamless wholes and this one is more a lot of great bits chaotically strung together, it's still lots of fun. Recommended.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","kati-72719","4 May 2023","My world! From someone who's not really into GOTG, this movie is undoubtedly the best (not counting of course the Avengers). My god! Got me crying, laughing, crying again, laughing historically, and crying some more! My god! Amazing! Amazing performances from everyone! They manage to create a wonder of a movie with a kind of basic plot. Best performances to me are from Nebula, the high evolutionary and Mantis's actors. Brilliant! Rocket's story just brings the feels right at the skin. Impossible not to just dive into the story and love everything about this team. What a wonderful group of misfits! Congrats James Gunn!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","JayWolfgramm","3 June 2023","After so many of the post ""Avengers: Endgame"" Marvel movies failing to impress, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a breath of fresh air. It definitely finds itself on the good end of the MCU power ranking. The fact that James Gunn writes and directs this entry as well helps give the trilogy a sense of cohesion that the other Marvel movies lack.This movie can be both very funny, like the other two, but also surprisingly dark and delightfully heartwarming. Some people may think that the MCU relies on comedy too much, that having comedic relief is in some way inheritably a bad thing. But such is not the case for James Gunn. This film is able to balance the humorous moments with the deeper parts much better than ""Thor: Love and Thunder"". That being said, there were a good portion of the jokes that just weren't all that funny, or if they were, they just lasted a little too long. None of them came at a time that diminished a sincere moment, but some just did not land well.I liked the villain's motivation and his connection with the Guardians. But the way he comes across in action is like a child throwing a temper tantrum. Every other scene he's screaming. It does help him become less likable. But trust me, this guy does not need any extra help with making him unlikable. He is absolutely despicable. He is definitely someone you have no qualms in wanting to see him fail.I enjoy how quickly the movie gets going. The main characters get their goal presented to them fairly quickly. The movie doesn't juggle too many different plot points, it is very straight forward with a clear objective from beginning to end.The movie does however cut to series of flashbacks. For a lot of people, they really enjoyed these scenes. I do agree that they add a lot of necessary heart and character to the present-day storyline. But with what we the audience know about the present; everyone knows exactly where this story is going. That can make the reveal a bit less passionate. I don't know, maybe I'm just heartless.I like a good ensemble cast, that is something that has always helped the Guardians and the X-Men, they have a good cast of diverse characters to work off of. Not all the characters have a compelling arc to go through, but they try. And every one of the main cast has a moment to shine.The soundtrack has always been an important part of the GotG franchise. Now that Starlord has a Zune, his playlist has expanded to include more contemporary music. Personally, this change didn't work for me. I am a huge fan of the oldies, and I felt that helped give the movies their identity. Not a huge thing, I just think that this soundtrack was the franchise's weakest.There are some character decisions that don't quite add up for me. At times characters will act like killing is something that they will never do, then the same character in the next scene will be killing dozens without hesitation.The action is well choreographed, particularly a fight scene towards the end, if you've seen the movie you know which one I'm talking about. The problem I have is that the characters never feel vulnerable. Characters will be shot, stabbed, decapitated, exploded, necks broken and will just hop up like nothing happened. One of the characters seems to be a mixture between the T-1000 and Silly Putty. That really takes out any suspense that any action scene may have when the characters seem to be invincible. Even the cool action scene, isn't a girt and grind fight. It is more of a: ""Look how cool our heroes are"" moment.Overall, it is a good movie. There are just a few things that hold me back from saying it is a great film. Some jokes go on too long. The music doesn't hit that hard. The emotional moments are too predictable. The villain comes across more annoying than threatening. And our heroes seem to be too unstoppable to make any action scene feel important. It is still a fun time, and for me, still the best Marvel movie in quite some time. If you are a fan of the Guardians, then go ahead and Come and get your love.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","raben-81146","19 November 2023","For the third and maybe last time the Guardians of Galaxy are gathered to fight bad guys in space. In between the action there are tragic backstories, nostalgia kicks like Howard the Duck again and references like the Alf postcard at the ending. The visual effects team did it again with outstanding effects and the makeup team too that deserves a third run for the Oscars. And, such a shame there are no stuntman Oscars category yet. The movie is not just for the kids, but also the mature science fiction and action movie loving audience. This trilogy may be the end, but there are so many Guardians of the Galaxy spinoffs to stream on Disney Plys.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","tddsccy","4 May 2023","Everything since endgame has been pretty close to garbage but this movie and what the cast and james gunn has done truly makes me weep because its a shame that now everything else will revert back to falling short and having no connection to audiences. So many ups and downs, an emotional roller coaster and is a masterpiece triology that end with me wishing james gunn the very best at DC and i look forward to his future projects. My only requests now are that kevin feige and katherine kennedy leave their spots at marvel and star wars and place John favreau in at marvel and dave filoni at star wars and for disney to burn to the ground for ruining everything since they took control.","3/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","troy-daniel-bush","14 June 2023","It's amazing to see how far James Gunn has come since making Slither. He goes from making these gory, campy action and horror movies, and now he's head of the DCEU, and making these big-budget, ambitious studio projects for DC and MARVEL with complete creative freedom. If these aren't signs of his talents then I don't know what is.Oftentimes the third entry in a trilogy is the worst, but I think it might be the opposite case here!I'm not joking, this movie had me in tears because I was either so sad or so happy!All of the characters are given a chance to shine! You can tell James Gunn has nothing but love and respect for these characters!Nearly all of the jokes hit bullseyes!There is some legitimately disturbing imagery in this movie!All of the actors give it their all, and there isn't a single weak link amongst them! And you can tell everyone on-screen was having a blast and that just adds to the experience.It has been a long time since I've despised a villain!The makeup and practical effects are INSANE!!The digital effects are flawless!The movie flies by!The action scenes are fun and sometimes brutal. There's an incredibly satisfying single-take action scene that brought my jaw to the floor!This is some of the best directing James Gunn has given us!There is excellent cinematography!I have one very minor criticism: Some jokes were injected in at inappropriate moments.It's my favorite movie of the year so far!Go watch it!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","FilmFan777","31 December 2023","Nothing cool or original. Seems as if Gunn did this wasted and for a paycheck. What an awful way to send off a Great franchise. Leaning on all the things that made this arc cool, yet reducing it to a cheap quick payoff. No wonder Marvel is failing and this is a perfect example. What tripe.I felt nothing from this, mote like cheated from the greatness it once was. What an utter disappointment.There was nothing to feel here. Just like this review saying it's too short but, I have nothing more to say for this waste of space wannabe so, I have to write more when I don't want to waste anymore of my time.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","kosmasp","10 May 2023","No pun(s) intended - and one of two things I was thinking of after I watched the movie. The other one will be my closing line on this review. This being the closing chapter (or volume as James Gunn likes to repeatedly tell us), everything is possible, right? So you will be watching this and have certain expectations ... maybe those will be fulfilled - but maybe not. And that is not just about finality - but also about resolving and resolutions.But let's get back to the beginning - actually we really go to the beginning. The beginning of Rocket - we will see him before he became the character we love now. I assume the story about his ... becoming/being made/born is being told in the comics too. I am quite certain there is a game where the story is being told. And while I knew about it (remembered most of it), it still stayed as emotional as people were saying all the time.The timeline - the way James Gunn edited the movie, is really fine. You may wonder if there even can be a Guardians movie without him at the helm ... the future will show us. The movie has it all - it plants and it sows. It has the humor you have been expecting it to have - and the characters are true to themselves. There are throwaway characters that get their moment to shine (looking at you carrot face), you have good boys and bad boys (and good boys being called bad boy - well you'll know when you watch the movie) ... and many other things. Oh and we get a lot of cameos - one I almost confused with Stan Lee. They are allowed to use his image now - but it was Lloyd Kaufman. Good for him and Gunn to have him in this. Also Howard the Duck and so many other people/characters, that you probably will spot - especially if you are into the comics.The movie I expected nothing from grew on me - and if you have no emotions at all after watching this - someone has to check your pulse. Kidding aside, this is a love letter to Science Fiction, to comedy - and it has the very first ""f""-word of the MCU ... one would expect it to come from Samuel L. Jackson .. but we get surprised (not just by this fact) ... and Chris Pratt is the one to utter it. And the great thing is, you may not even notice it - because it is just so fitting - the way it is delivered ... it just rolls of the tongue and the scene warrants it - it would have worked without it ... but I am not complaining they included it.Visual effects are good - something that many did complain about (rightfully mostly I reckon) in the previous movies. But it is the story that holds this together and makes us fall in love with everyone. Or to quote someone and bring my review to an end: I love you guys - another one you may not entirely notice, but a big moment! I am ... satisfied! To say the least.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","paoball","11 May 2023","I'm a fan of the Guardian movies. The first was fabulous , the second was fun, but the third -this was so uneven and the music was awful. The dialogue was very angry and went on and on, how can it be for kids or even teens?, I really disliked the negativity by Gamora and the Manta girl. Only a rating given of 6 by me and what happened to the whoever chose the music? I only recognizes 2 tunes. Some good scenes were outnumbered by a bunch of mediocre ones. Chris Pratt was good and I liked the development of the background of a few characters like Rocket. Gaps in continuity and storyline too. Wait on this to come to Netflix!","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","hemilia","3 May 2023","This movie became my favourite one the moment the lights in the movie hall turned on.Everything about it is just so good. The humour is top tier; the whole theater was laughing in unity. The imagery and sound system were amazing (I'm referring to the fact that you completely fell like you're part of the movie). The storyline is very exciting, I often found myself gripping the chair and it made my cry a few times.There are two things that especially stood out to me: the soundtrack (ofc, one of the main reasons why I love the GOTG series so much), and the evolution of the caracters. I loved how we could really see their development, which sometimes took me by a complete surprise and I didn't feel like there was something missing from the movie.All in all, thank you James Gunn and everyone for this masterpiece! If I had more money, I'd spend it all in the movies seeing this over and over again, because seeing it once is definitely not enough, you just wanna keep watching.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","moviemanmo973","6 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 gives audiences much of what it has given them in the previous installments.Once again the music is good and ties into the action sequences giving the scenes a bit more life. There are some good laughs in this film, personally the funniest was Dave Bautista. He doesn't deviate from what he has done in the previous films and I was always waiting for him to deliver his lines. There were some moments with other characters where the humor was forced but overall it felt organic.I enjoyed how Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana were able to display their chemistry even with their dynamic relationship. The rest of the guardians were great especially when it came to the action sequences. There are a couple tag team moments that were visually pleasing.The majority of this film focuses on Rocket and how he came to be. With the use of flashbacks his backstory is pieced together to give some emotional moments.All of the character designs are well put together except for some of the guards in a certain scene that look like they are just humans wearing weird bubble suits. The best character design by far was the main villain played by Chukwudi Iwuji. I really enjoyed his look and his story in this movie. Personally I wanted him to be more fierce considering he was the main villain. Sean Gunn who played Kraglin was another character I wanted more from although he wasn't disappointing.The one character that did disappoint was Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. I wouldn't blame Poulter, I felt he did what was asked of him as an actor. I put blame on the writers. Adam Warlock was an underwhelming character that only served as a very weak comic relief.His character arc was predictable and his scene involving Chris Pratt towards the end of the film was one of the weaker moments.Overall, I think this movie is just good. I would say it's just slightly above okay.","2/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","danydarko-34609","8 July 2023","So given marvels recent few years of disappointments, endgame, Thor 4, Dr Strange 2 and Antman 3 I'm talking to you! I was as worried as most that the guardians final outing would possibly not live up to the greatness of volumes 1 & 2, especially given the delay with this last chapter due to Disney firing then rehiring James Gunn, proving once again how much of a mess they can make of things. However I am VERY happy to report, it's the BEST of the bunch! I don't really know where to start! It's got great action, the opening scene really kicks things off straight away! There's deep emotions on display particularly from Star Lord, but all get to show their fair share. And the comedy as usual is very funny and off the wall as with previous instalments. And finally as always yet again, the soundtrack rocks! James Gunn really has pulled out all the stops and gives the guardians the grand send off they all deserve. A word of warning tho to those wanting to show it to their young children, it does include marvels first f bomb, as well as some of the scenes are really quite dark which was surprising, but still great! Everyone in it gives great performances especially Adam warlock, although comic book fans may disagree with the direction of the character, I personally found him hilarious. The bad guy at times does border on the line of slightly of over acting occasionally but overall he's a good bad guy. It's bittersweet as it's the last guardians film but it is such a good final instalment, strongly confirming the guardians trilogy to be up there with some of the greats like the dark knight trilogy, Indiana jones, Star Wars etc. I've tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible but fans of Firefly will love a few cameos! Anyway hopefully I've encouraged enough of you that you will have a good time watching this, if you don't, then watch it again just incase there's anything you may have missed! I'm very much hoping this gets released on bluray in 3D as it looks incredible in 3D also! I truly congratulate James Gunn on producing such a unique and brilliantly entertaining trilogy. It's going to be a long time until we get another trilogy that is this consistent with its quality and brilliance. Wishing you and your families well and until next time, may the force be with you.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nickoleterrible","5 May 2023","I am sincerely surprised seeing all those good reviews . Honnestly it was bad. I didn't hear a single laugh for the whole movie, no ""wow"". It was dead silent. Saw couple of folks leaving.The funniest character of the guardians was there all along, but he was almost dead except for the last 10 minutes. Not a single line, no action for Rocket. Except when they were digging in his past, when he wasn't really Rocket. And those parts were so cheesy i was pretty close to leave.At least when Groot re-borned in the second movie it was funny seeing baby Groot. Here they left Rocket aside. It's like new guys wrote the script for this one cause it was completely different. It was a serious Guardian of the galaxy, no special bad-ass vibes we used to see.10 the first, 8 for the second, and only 2 for this one.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nolinger-48439","7 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fitting farewell to a fan-favorite group of heroes. It's great. It's action packed and funny, but also heartfelt. It does a great job of introducing us to Rocket's backstory, which contains some truly heartbreaking scenes. Its comedy works and is reminiscent of the first two movies. It also has a lot of great action scenes, the standout being the hallway scene. That scene alone was worth price of the ticket if you ack me. It was incredible.Another thing that deserves praise is the High Evolutionary. They did a great job with this villain. It's refreshing that they finally made a villain that the viewer could hate and not try to make another sympathetic villain like Thanos. They just went all out in making the High Evolutionary unlikable.I also appreciate that James Gunn managed to give everyone a satisfying arc at the end.Once again, James Gunn killed it. It saddens me that this is the last Guardians film, and that James Gunn is done with Marvel, but I also look forward to what he can do with DC.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","bryvill","4 May 2023","The movie is a feel good movie, with all the usual comedic antics and non stop action and adventure! What I like most is how they injected the comedy, it's so real and laugh out loud moments. This sequel has a lot of ""heart"" on it, it may cry you at times. The soundtrack has more cool music, brings back all good and classic times. The only down part for me is some scenes felt slow but it didn't spoil it, you'll still love it, watching on the big screen feels so good and complimenting with the best sound system will make you fell like you're in a roller coaster ride! Bring all the popcorn and enjoy the ride!","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","critic_w","6 August 2023","It's okay. But here's the problem. These are suppose to be ""Super Hero"" films, but they all run short on ""hero."" You will be entertained. You will laugh, perhaps cry, and you'll certainly hate the villain. But without spoiling the story, the victorious cheers are rare. Remember when Quill got the orb on Morag in GotG V1? Remember when they broke out of the Kyln? Remember those victorious feelings. Well, you're gonna have to, because Marvel has lost the hero quality to it's movies. And this was perhaps Marvel's last hope. Of all their properties Guardians relied on a good story the most. But going back to Black Widow, the ability to tell an exciting and victorious Good vs. Evil story seems to have left the building. Maybe they can find their way with Marvels or Brave New World ... but I doubt it. So, 3 points for the laughs, 3 for excitement, and 1 because at least it was better than QuantumMania, and Wakanda Forever. Which unfortunately, isn't saying much.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","kqbkmp","4 May 2023","I certainly loved this movie. It was funny, it was emotional, it was dark and it was really action packed. You will be in for a suprise! This movie isn't for eveyone, since there is some animal cruelty here, but i wouldn't let that stop anyone from watching it because it's so much more to the film. You really feel the love they all for each other, and what made it believable are the performances. They were all great in their roles. I have to add that the special effects were great also, throughout the entire film. And the action is phenomenal considering it's a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie. Though, it isn't a perfect film. Not all of the jokes land, and it does feel kind of messy at the end, which is a typical thing for the Guardians movies. Regardless, I think you'll love it. Hopefully Disney can now learn from their mistakes by understanding why the third installment of The Guardians of The Galaxy was such a hit amongst the fans.","9/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","nizarsalim","8 May 2023","In Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, everything is great. The story, performances of the cast, especially the one of Cooper, emotional weight, actions sequences, comedic scenes, direction, screenplay, soundtrack, cinematography, production value, visual and sound effects, and ending, are all perfect and have nothing to be said against them.The movie was so good to the extent that I felt that the 150 minutes runtime was like 15 minutes, or maybe less even.Regarding the flaws, the only flaw that I found in the movie was its little, if not no, connection to the current MCU story (Kang and the multiverse). Other than that, everything else was excellent. That is why when it comes to the score, I gladly give Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 9 out of 10.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ivanmessimilos","13 July 2023","Finally, after a long time and several mediocre/bad movies, the MCU has released one great movie. A great space adventure, action full of special effects, but also a film with a soul.We got to know the Guardians through two independent films and in several associations with other heroes, characters were built with their own traits, virtues, faults, so this film leaned on those foundations and improved them a little more. Although it lasts relatively long, I didn't get that feeling because the story flows neatly alternating with the action. A great balance of emotions, a lot of humor, but also a lot of tragedy, and that is not easy to achieve. I can't believe that my eyes watered a little at some scenes in a Marvel movie, it sounds almost impossible, but then that's a real sign that the director succeeded in his plan.This movie has everything a fun sf superhero movie should have, even a little more. Probably the most emotional MCU movie, but I can't forget to mention that there is still a lot of humor and great chemistry between the Guardians. I don't want to reveal anything about the plot because I didn't know anything either, so the final impression is great.This is not a perfect movie, I won't kid myself, some characters didn't make sense to me and I wondered why they were even in the movie. But in its genre and field, this is a superb and outstanding piece of work, especially praise goes to it because it completes an excellent trilogy, definitely the best in the MCU world.","8/10"

Had the perfect amount of everything - nostalgia, emotions, and a fitting ending.I was never much of a GOTG fan to begin with; therefore, my expectations were low as I only decided to watch it for the plot. However, I ended up having a really good time. In my opinion, this was the best one amongst the three. The visual effects were good, definitely worth watching in the theatre. Not to mention the amazing soundtracks used, and boy they did make perfect use of the soundtracks to hit you right in the feels.Confused whether to go watch it or wait?

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","aciessi","23 May 2023","They teased a finale and boy, is it ever. Guardians 3 is action-packed and filled with laughs, but it wears it's broken heart on its sleeve for the majority of its runtime. In particular, your soul will be crushed with Rocket Racoon's origin story. If you have a really soft spot for fluffy animals, be warned and maybe even steer clear. A decent 30-minute chunk of the film is the Rocket story, and as something standalone, it might be one of the best things Marvel has ever made. Ultimately, it brings a new dimension to a fan-favorite character whose novelty may have already been wearing thin. The rest of the film is just the kind of dynamite entertainment only James Gunn can provide. There's nothing like seeing the guardians travel and explore in the many bizarre realms of the galaxy. Even folks with Marvel fatigue won't be able to resist this.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","JMH-Torrance","7 August 2023","Liked seeing some of Rocket's backstory but they went back so many times it got too depressing and disturbing. Bringing back Gamora went nowhere and felt pointless. Groot is all grown up and no longer cute or funny. The High Evolutionary was so despicable I don't know why his minions didn't take him out sooner! Why was Nathan Fillion wasted on such a minor and pointless character? Action scenes are excellent but there are too many and they're so long it becomes a bit mind numbing. Vol. 3 felt at least a half hour too long and lacked the uniqueness and fun of the first two movies. Lastly the soundtrack felt forced and not as integral as the first movie.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","emilmalda","3 May 2023","This emotionally charged and entertaining rollercoaster takes you through some profoundly unpleasant scenes, yet the feelings of joy and friendship seep through the gruesome moments experienced by our favorite raccoon. But also shows you many funny and wholesome moments that add to the overall experience.Something that rarely is displayed which is heavily used in this film series is the use of music. The music in this movie does not show the average use as a enhancer for action scenes, well it does. But. It shows the importance of music as a comforting tool when we're either sad, lonely, or overwhelmed. Which is a great way to display the importance of music in our lives.This is the first time in a long time I've seen a such a good and deserving ending to a series. It really concludes the series but also set it up for future use which I'm eager to see what's up for the guardians future.","7/10"

I'm happy to say, that after a lot of MCU movies from the previous 2 years that didn't work for me, that this movie is still worth watching.There are some things that felt off, like I think that Adam Warlock's character didn't really ad anything to the story.But overall this is a nice closing chapter to the trilogy.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TheVictoriousV","9 May 2023","As I observed in my Ant-Man: Quantumania review, the bigger the MCU gets, the harder it gets to watch any of the trilogies by themselves, as there's so much else in this canon to account for. There's more and more that's good to know before you see the sequel to such-and-such, and there's more and more teasing being done for stuff that's set to happen in the future -- coming soon to a Chromecast near you!But now, with the final (?) entry in the Guardians of the Galaxy series, I do declare that we have one. One solid trilogy that can be viewed just fine as its own thing and may be remembered as the best, most accessible one from the MCU. There's still stuff that will seem strange if you haven't seen Infinity War and Endgame and don't know of the demise of Zoe Salda√±a's Gamora, or the time-travel nonsense that brought her back, but the film is written in such a way that this doesn't feel strictly mandatory.There's even a scene where Peter ""Star-Lord"" Quill, played again by Chris Pratt, references a slew of convoluted off-screen events to explain Gamora's resurgence and eventually gives up trying to make sense of it. For those who are only here for the Guardians pictures, it's believable that such a topsy-turvy adventure would've taken place in the years since the last movie; if you do know the other Avengers films -- and are as sick of it all as I am -- you'll appreciate the meta-humor. In true James Gunn fashion, there's more to the comedy here than you may expect from the MCU. (Some elements seem to lampoon not only the MCU project -- its consequences for artists, rarely getting to keep their own stories straight -- but the very Disney empire itself)What truly sets it apart, especially from the more recent titles, is the way Gunn treats his characters. Almost everything lately -- especially the nigh-insufferable Thor: Love and Thunder -- has leaned harder into the MCU's humorous side than ever. But this is often done in the form of characters treating everything, including themselves, as a joke.Gunn makes some of the weirder movies in the MCU, yet his characters never feel like SNL parodies; they're completely genuine -- at least, nobody is as much of a joke as Tazerface in the previous film. Yes, some scenes in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 are ruined by comedy, but they're usually jokes that make sense for the characters, particularly Mantis and Drax's absolutely unsalvageable social skills, and frequently get a laugh.The actors still seem to greatly enjoy the roles, as well. Pratt, Salda√±a, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Karen Gillan, and Sean Gunn reprise their roles from the previous films, and Chukwudi Iwuji plays the twisted High Evolutionary, who has a decidedly dark history with Cooper's Rocket Raccoon. (These flashbacks constitute the best scenes in the movie, giving us one of the most memorably loathsome MCU villains in many years.) We also -- somewhat pointlessly -- get Adam Warlock, whose nature in the tapestry of the comics' reality I won't even try to explain.Warlock does look fairly accurate (especially Will Poulter's eyebrows), bar the fact that his costume suffers the usual MCU-isms -- strips, pads, and anything that makes these costumes look over-designed and samey, as if all these different cultures and interstellar beings go to the same tailor -- where nothing pops or is ""too colorful"" or ""too goofy"". Still, like Vol. 2 (albeit not as much), the movie offers some of the more vibrant and interesting MCU sceneries, full of alien realms that look inviting despite the fact that everything probably wants to kill you. We even get some body horror and nasty critters (again: hilariously unsettling, yet cute and loveable), recalling Gunn's early days of B-horror nostalgia. Of course, Gunn also puts more thought into the use of licensed music than, say, the likes of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.All-in-all, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 may be exactly what the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs. The consensus seems to be that the MCU is riding on this film and that, following the less-than-desirable box office numbers of Thor 4 and Quantumania, it's all down to Gunn; if Guardians 3 fails to make bank, it may be time to accept that the MCU is finally done. As it seems, however, people are really into this movie.In between its annoyances, it hits that sweet spot -- while also being kooky -- like only Gunn knows how. Brian Tallerico correctly identified him as ""one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice"" and was even more on-point when writing that he ""loves his outcasts"". The film is certainly not perfect (weird character decisions and wasted potential are its worst non-tone-related issues), but considering everything else that's being put forth by Disney as of late, ""not perfect"" seems pretty damn incredible -- and also, considering the themes of the story, pretty apt.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","alwinsup","12 May 2023","I had high hopes and lucky these were achieved. This movie had a good amount of jokes and laugh scenes. Storyline was better then volume 2. The golden boy was maybe not that great but did also not really mind his presence. Some more music time in comparison with the last two titles wich was nice. All the caracters were good written and had their moments of fame. Even the surrounding characters had a good positive vibe to the movie. I hope Marvel will look to new kind of movies with the same humor level. I am a little worried that one character alone with a own movie will not be strong enough to carry a movie but maybe who knows.","1/10"

One thing I love about this movie is the development of each and every character throughout not just this film, but the entire Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. Marvel did an absolutely amazing job! This volume also evoked so many emotions! Not to mention the soundtrack is fantastic as always! The beginning, the climax, and the ending are absolutely perfect and I would change nothing!

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","just_funme","10 July 2023","Its praises have been sung already.This is how you end a trilogy, with nothing short than a big bang of a movie. The characters have grown, but still have their own little quirks. The bait villain was perfectly introduced and portrayed. The actual villain was not played as a misunderstood teenager with a god complex ( looking at you Kang ), the acting was top notch. Expertly crafted visuals combining practical and CGI seamlessly. And a bittersweet goodbye...You can nitpick if you really try, but its faults are neglijabile compared to the spectacle you just witnessed.One of the best Marvel movie that came out in recent years and a great trilogy overall. They sure know how to pull on the ol' heartstrings...","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","antone-81696","20 May 2023","DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS MOVIEThe movie was honestly awful anyways. Throughout the movie they pushed hard for cheap humor and spent too much time on it. Often times they tried to cover up the horrific graphic violence with some of these cheap cracks at humor.The terrified face of the little boy sitting behind me will forever be imprinted in my memory. I felt so bad for him after the scene where all the caged animals get mutilated graphically. Not that the lab animals weren't demonically scary to begin with. This was even about 15 minutes after Disney let Chris Pratt drop the f-bomb in a movie kids of all ages were sure to be at and not to mention the octopus selling meth to kid animals.Shame on Disney. They are out of control. These marvel movies have always been enjoyable for all ages. They clearly have a goal to turn children into some desensitized monsters.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","pc95","4 June 2023","I liked the Original Guardian's of the Galaxy, but the franchise has gone downhill with the 2nd and now amongst the worst for this 3rd installment turkey. Gunn seems to run out of good ideas.I dont care about animal characters talking to one another in
a cell. The villain was whiny and annoying. Ideas for scenes are incoherent or dumb. The charm and intrigue of the original is long gone and this is a worn out exercise. Scene after scene gets stretched out excruciatingly and the humor falls flat mostly - with a lot of posing for camera going on. Then Gunn falls into the same problem his predecessor 2nd movie had with overuse of 70s/80s music and formulaic employment patterns of change scene, start new 70s music, rinse, repeat. All this for 150 mind numbing minutes. Was checking my watch over and over. Should've heeded my wife's recommendation to wait until available on streaming. 4/10.","9/10"

Cameos and the return of past characters added some fun satisfaction.All of those positives and I *still* stand by my very unpopular opinion...the first hour and forty minutes of Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 3 were boring as hell. It was so disappointing. I was not the only in the theatre who had a ""long blink."" The man next to me snored out loud.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","randabehnam","4 August 2023","Guardians has been my least favourite marvel story but this film changed everything. It's a lot more serious than the previous, and it's a total emotional rollercoaster.I never thought I'd love a racoon so much! But the characters all had a lot of focus and drax pretty much stole the film.The directors knew how to pull on the heart strings and if you are an animal lover then you will need tissues when watching this.Adam warlock seemed unnecessary until the end when he really mattered. I heard myself gasping in shock at parts of this film and wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. I will no doubt be watching this again.","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","matrixuk-51283","5 August 2023","To be honest, after Guardians of the Galaxy 2, I wasn't expecting much from this movie.I am pleased to be proven wrong.As a Rocket fan I was excited to see the take on his origin story and I guarantee even the stoniest of hearts would be sad for him.The viewer can see why he's so angry and why he's so loyal to friends.Still no Howard the Duck as a Guardian, but I'm sure, like the comics, his time will come.There are a few scenes that might seem strange to anyone that hasn't watched the Christmas special.It's the 1st Guardians of the Galaxy movie without the Star Lord helmet.And also the 1st to include the F bomb.We see a more mature and sombre Guardian team after the loss of Gamora.Even Drax seems subdued a little.Will Poulter brings nothing to the movie but that's down to his character, Adam Warlock, being shoe horned in to a movie just for the sake of it.Adam Warlock is purely there for the end scene of the movie, and no other reason.I thought when the saw the original Guardian line up at the end of the 2nd movie we were going to see them in some capacity in this movie too, but alas it wasn't to be.All in all a good solid movie, sure it's a little predictable, but it's one of those rare ""super hero"" movies where we actually see a character grow.Go see it!","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","hexagongraphicsuk","28 July 2023","We have been subjected to franchise upon franchise of half baked member berries and re-imaginings over the past years that something original and with heart is desperately needed.The way Disney has treated Marvel and Star Wars is shocking and a rant for another place. But through the wreckage, James Gunn has somehow retained the heart of iconic directors such as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.Finally after years of bland superhero movies and writers who care more about their personal agenda over storytelling, we have the third in the trilogy which should be known as the Star Wars of our generation.Guardians of the Galaxy got side-lined in the larger Marvel project and didn't get the praise and promotion it deserved.As a stand - alone trilogy, the James Gunn Guardians of the Galaxy is a wonder.It has loveable characters, great action, compelling story and satisfying resolution.This should have been a blockbuster of the year. Unfortunately, the poor Marvel movies that proceeded it created a general sense of Marvel underwhelming.People who may have loved to se this in the cinema were apathetic because of the terrible movies produced since Disney got hold of the MCU.Watch it. Love it. As a trilogy the Guardians of the Galaxy should become a loved phenomenon to sit along side Star Wars in our go-to Sci- fi action adventure movies.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","gavinp9","5 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3' is the fifth MCU trilogy to wrap up, but the difference here is that it feels like we've been waiting a long time, as it's almost 9 years since the original film showed us how fun and unique a ragtag bunch of semi-superhero aliens could be. Following the events of 'Avengers: Endgame' (and, to a lesser degree, 'Thor: Love & Thunder' and the Holiday Special), we pick up with Peter (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper), Groot (Diesel), Nebula (Gillan), Mantis (Klementieff), Drax (Bautista), Cosmo (Bakalova) and Kraglin (Gunn) when they're attacked by Adam Warlock (Poulter) and Rocket is injured, sending them on a journey to save him.We see a lot - maybe too much? - of Rocket's history via flashback and how he came to be. While a lot of this is emotional and builds his characters, the other characters - including the ""new"" Gamora (Saldana) - somehow seem to not have as much to do, or somehow just a little off. The ""bad guy"" they're out to defeat is The High Evolutionary (Iwuji), who has undefined powers, but needless to say, likes experimenting on animals trying to perfect evolution.There's some cameos, another good soundtrack (including a nice call-back in the mid-credits scene), top-notch CGI and some funny moments throughout. But for all the good moments, they're almost balanced with not-quite-right parts - the melancholy version of Radiohead's Creep that sets an odd tone, Rocket's whole arc, the organic space station, the High Evolutionary's mask, Gamora's character, Warlock's near pointlessness and the inevitable ending. It's not that it's bad or that they don't work, it's just a lot darker and less exuberant than the other two films.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jychoi-26438","28 June 2023","I've been really looking forward to this because Guardians of the Galaxy is by far my favorite from the MCU. Overall it was a good movie, but I couldn't help being disappointed by some aspects of it.What I enjoyed about this movie (and the two previous ones as well) is that it's such a heartwarming story that shows a beautiful friendship and teamwork among characters that would easily be considered misfits in some way or another. They don't always agree with each other, and the teamwork doesn't really seem seamless, but their heart is in the right place and they really care about each other. This is the real strength of Guardians of the Galaxy, and the third of its series did not disappoint in that manner. And of course, the cast is amazing, and the music selection is just perfect.Two things that really bothered me about Vol. 3:
1) I get that experimenting on animals can be bad, and I get that this can be an analogy of what happened among humans as well. But the way it was shown was so shallow. The movie repeatedly showed how cruel the experiment was to Rocket and his friends, and it successfully made the audience feel bad for what happened to them, but that was all. For the amount of time that the movie spent on showing the cruelty of the experiment, it didn't go into any depth of why it's really bad or why the villain thought the experiment was so necessary, so I ended up thinking ""All right, I get it, I get it. Can we move on?""
2) The villain was too weak. There was a lot of build-up about how strong High Evolutionary was, but it seemed like he was pretty easily defeated. It is a superhero movie, after all. The fight was too anti-climactic.So I don't give it the 10/10 that I was hoping for. It was still a good movie, especially compared to how disappointing the other Marvel movies have been recently.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","hdsn-18222","3 May 2023","Just come of the cinema and I am gobsmacked! This movie hits all the notes and is a genuine rollercoaster of emotions.The feeling, the aesthetics, the soundtrack, the humour all work in unison wonderfully, alongside a story which spends most of its time focussing mainly on Rocket's backstory as well as moving forward for our heroes. I simply cannot wait to watch it again.I laughed, I cried (3 times) and I was blown away. The action sequences completely land (especially the scene with the Beastie Boys - No Sleep Til Brooklyn backing track).This movie is absolute perfection.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","valadas","22 May 2023","Those who love sci--fi movies will surely love this one . Those who don't will appreciate it because its images, scenes and sequencies are superb. The story itself is the continuation of the two previous volumes. It takes place in a far away galaxy planet in a future very far away from the Earth's past. The main subject is the continuation of the opposition and fight of the Guardians and the High Evolutionary. The Guardians are led by the terrestrial Peter Quill. The movie develops itself in successive physical and technologic fights shown through great and powerful technologic images of course with computer help. The characters are human beings that behave like animals and animals that behave like human beings and are actually anthropomorphic. The action is strong and permanent during the movie's exhibition. One of the best sci-fi movies as a matter of fact.","8/10"

Each character is so masterfully developed by its own and while there is lots going on, nothing is irrelevant or misplaced. The soundtrack is phenomenal, there is no other words to describe it.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Brother_Maynards_Brother","3 August 2023","Just finished watching this work. I was left quite satisfied. I was moved as there is genuine heart in the flick. About halfway through, I suddenly realized that I was smiling. Said physical arc remained on my visage for the remainder of the runtime. There were a number of great action sequences - lots of clever human/CGI fusions. Y'know the types of visual media that grow more appreciated by one over time? This flick will surely be one for me.I started absorbing Marvel comics (never dug D. C.) in the early 70s when I was quite young. This period of consistent Marvel repasts lasted only about eight years but my youthful love for those great comics never left me. The MCU movies through phase three were all good (well, save Iron Man 2, The Hulk and Captain Marvel) but the first Guardians movie was an outlier. Though the group was a minor entity in the comics of yore, they were re-invented as an outstanding bundle of flawed, clever, bickering, irreverent and dancing characters. The flick was just SO MUCH FUN. The team was incredibly endearing, the humor always hit, the action was top-notch and the musical selections were inspired - it was truly superb. It stood above all the other Marvel flicks in terms of quality. Now that Marvel's offerings have gone astray in terms of quality, starting with phase four, I had feared that Guardians 3 would be infected with the general suckitude virus that sadly has afflicted all other recent works (save the Spidey flick, which was fun and engaging). How relieved I am that Guardians 3 turned out to be a far outlier, in terms of quality, compared with the non-Spidey phase four and five efforts.To whoever selected the Spacehog, The The, X and The Replacements tracks, I salute you. To all involved with the creation of Guardians 3, I bow deeply before you. Very well done!Qapla'!","10/10"

He is cruelty with no bounds, no justification just evil.The action is great and the CG is the best it has been in a long while, the music is perfect such a perfected list that suits the movie to the ground.Stand outs are Drax, Mantis, flashback rocket and I must say Nebulas arc in her MCU journey is great !!

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Jithindurden","7 May 2023","They wanted to make people emotional and the way it unfolded felt a bit too desperate for it but it still works on most of the target audience. But maybe due to that, too many scenes had a disjointed feel to it. But the needle-drops, while feeling a bit forced, make the audience forget about the disjointedness. The High Evolutionary would have been more impactful if it was someone else even though the actor did fine. But when you see giant names in the cast who has nothing to do and then this guy with such a huge role comes in making no huge impact, it just feels way more important that it should've been someone else.","8/10"

The team must find a passcode to prevent his death within 48 hours. Along the way, they face dangerous foes, including the High Evolutionary, who created Rocket.Dave Bautista's character in the film is exceptionally funny, and I am glad he was given the opportunity to showcase his comedic talent. However, I have some concerns about Nebula. Did she enhance her abilities? How was she able to repair herself in the heat of battle? In Endgame, she shot her future self, yet she inexplicably managed to heal herself and generate weapons. I guess lots have changed during the years.This film exceeds expectations and is one of the best in the Marvel franchise, with Jame Gunn's direction deserving particular praise.","9/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","LeeLeeds","11 November 2023","This film was a great way to end what was a really enjoyable trilogy for the Guardians of the Galaxy.Now after having Peter's backstory earlier in the series, we shift to Rocket and while my expectations were low for whatever his 'reveal' was, they were totally exceeded by a beautiful, touching and heartbreaking tale of how Rocket came to be the angry hero we all came to know in the MCU.It's a shame this film was released somewhat out of sync with an ideal release flow after end game. We could of done with this as a kind of 'encore' to the main story of The Avengers and not had to so sit through some of the other films released in between End Game and G3.But Guardians 3 stays true to the original vibe of fun, ridiculous, touching, better than you expect cinema that started with the first film.In terms of the MCU. It's done. Every film released since End Game other than this has been awful. So if like me you have gone from MCU fan to angry to now apathetic, use Guardians 3 as the send off and final instalment of what was a brilliant series of comic book stories.","10/10"

He was so tortured and traumatized but there is a sliver lining in that dark cage,his animal friends who share the same painful experience. My eyes are full of tears watching them go through all the misery. This storyline was so well developed and served as a backbone of the whole film. Besides, this film also focus on the personality trait of every guardian members. So marvelously written that if you're a first time viewer,you will definitely attracted to their playfulness, goofiness and dedication and amused by them. For people who are familiar with them,you find new delight in them. They had fights and bickering like all friends do,but the commitment and trust they have for each other formed such a strong bond among them. They would rescue, help each other without hesitation. The film also portraits a very despicable and psycho villian that I feel disguised looking at him,in a way a very successful character. All in all, it's the best among the guardian trilogy and there are so many emotional, amusing, delightful scenes that I would go back for rewatch,well done to cast and the production team.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","No-Life-101","7 July 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 - I finally got around to watching the movie and am so happy I did! The opening scene is excellent and shows all of the characters, the music is cool and relaxing which helps tell the story of ""this place is slow and steady"". As a warning, there are depictions of animal cruelty but things don't get too graphic, it's needed to tell the story of Rocket and his origins, and some parts were heartwarming and also heartbreaking. On another note, the thing I like most about the Guardian movies is the world-building that it has, because the story is set in space there are countless worlds that can be brought in with new characters. Also, the action scenes are engaging and fun, easy to follow along, and not overwhelming, it also fits the plot and shows that they're not just fighting for the fun of it.Additionally, the ending scene (and post-credit scene) was very heartwarming to watch. I somehow went months without seeing a spoiler for this movie and it was great because I went into the movie without knowing anything which made me love every single minute.Additional Notes:
The movie is very colourful, as is space, so it looks realisticI always forget how overpowered Mantis can be when she uses her powersNebula has changed so much since her first appearance and she is now one of my favourite charactersI was surprised to hear the swearing, normally Marvel movies don't contain swearGroot got upgrades in this movie! Looking goodI want to give Rocket a hug.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","rodrigo-34215","3 August 2023","Thanks to the whole team for this film. I loved bringing the theme of animals, it was an important part for me.And the more adult footprint, better dialogs, better characterization, ambient. .Kind off bored watching the last movies of Marvel, all plastic and forced situations.Here, we go back to the ""adult simplicity"" off fun. And the hole history of Rocket, pretty nice. I sincerely preferred movies made for more specific audience. That way, you can make movies who really ""talk"" with your audience and don't try speak the same ""language"" with everyone. I think it was the best part. See ya.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","moparmulv","5 August 2023","With the absolute stinkers/cookie cutter superhero movies Marvel has been coming out with as of late, it was refreshing to see a movie that was full of heart and kept me wanting more and more. I can usually predict what is going to happen, but this one kept me guessing all the way through! This movie didn't only make me laugh (as I thought it would) it made me tear up quite a few times, and I don't often get emotional over cgi characters. If you are a fan of GOTG please do yourself a favor and watch this movie! Thank you to James Gunn and the fantastic cast to send this amazing trilogy out on a high note!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ActionMovieDude","7 May 2023","I'm a huge fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy films and this one did not disappoint. Everyone got their shining moment, Star Lord, Gamora, Groot, Nebula, Drax and of course, Rocket who is the real breakout of this film.Watching Rocket's horrific past really affected not only myself but the rest of the audience that I attended this movie with. It really shows the heartbreaking past of our favorite raccoon.But this film is not all heartache, there are plenty of very funny moments as well, as well as some of the best action of any Marvel film to date. The team comes full circle by the film's end.After watching some really truly horribly AWFUL Marvel TV shows. (Here's looking at you, She-Hulk, Ms Marvel, Wandavision etc) and after some really bad recent Marvel films, Guardians 3 puts the Marvel universe back on track.Hopefully the upcoming The Marvel isn't nearly as bad as the awful Ms. Marvel Disney plus show was.Good luck to James Gunn who is leaving Marvel to head up the film division of DC films.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","MartinOaks","9 July 2023","Sensational first hour or so of footage in which the extravagant characters of the saga shine again, the hooliganism of James Gunn behind the scenes, and a very Marvel-like script. But of course, for the umpteenth time now, Disney impregnates everything good with that puerile and finicky whiff that, little by little, is smearing with sweetener what until then worked well.A surplus of animalist sentimentality, Aryan children everywhere, and that need to tear adulterated tears from you nearing the end, simply to mark territory and confirm that everything that we were previously passionate about as shameless, mischievous, or troublemaker, is now in the cold and dead hands of Walt Disney.","9/10"

I will not reveal too much in this review because dont want to ruin your experience..Firstly we have all been complaining about the VFX work of recent MCU projects. But this movie made a fabulous work on this department..Salute to James Gunn for Perfectly writing & directing the story.Action scenes are great.. Background works are fantastic too..One thing that makes this movie special will be it's story and how it progresses in the movie..This movie is way too emotional than its predecessors. In some scenes you will definitely cry üò•üò•Anyway a nice goodbye to this beautiful franchiseAlthough credit scenes puts us into cliffhanger but hoping for the best üòçüòçüòç","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ariqakbar","17 July 2023","This Sequel Amazingly consistent with the way it deliver the story. It's pretty rare to see this kind of consistency on today movies.The romance, Comedy, Actions, from all aspect such writing, scene, the change of layout resolution. Genius. Really Genius.They did the story justice to make gamora decide what she had to do in the last part. Thats a good story right there.The closing, it was really warm and thoughtful. They really wrap it all with such solid ending. I think with that kind of ending, we all will be happy for whatever this franchise decide to GOTG next decision.I think this series is one of the greatest sequel marvel ever had.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","rgkarim","5 May 2023","LIKES:The Plot
-A movie loaded with so much expectations has a lot to handle by Volume 3, and Guardians did not seem to be the movie to improve.-I was wrong. The plot is loaded with so much goodness it's hard to pick apart much of anything.-Strong underlying ties pick apart most characters, and help address and develop them to a classy, but fun way that had me hooked.-It wrapped itself up in comedy and other quirks, but never lost sight of the goals or focus of a character plot and it was amazing to see that happen.-And then to have a fantastic set of climaxes, to utilize old and new and handle it with such grace and yet crude fun, almost unheard of in these days.--And to keep things mixed up and constantly engaging... Gunn nailed it with the direction and writing to tie so much into a rather strong narrative that did not get lost in culture or political agendas. Wow.The Music
-Holy crap was this fun as ever. Guardians is always known for music and again they succeeded in picking a track list to fill the movie with.-The movie is of course homage to some of the most recognizable and daring songs, with variety that works to keep things dynamic and fun.-But yet, the movie again uses the music to so many levels. Comedy, a buzz vibe with action, and that perfect montage/image idea that feels like a PR shot of the characters
-Such combinations and balance, I absolutely loved its use and had a wonderful time with the selection and its use again just being that grade A pick.The Special Effects
-It's an investment in things that show how realistic you can make these make believe worlds come to life and look so polished and good.-Guardians takes this wonderful blend of real life tricks of the trade with computers and giving you the best of both worlds.'It's beautiful and adds that balance that will help age the movie well, and I feel that this just made so much come to life.-Those on animation blended things incredibly, capturing anatomy and physiology to a degree and helping add more to the shimmer of the movies
-And then comes the action moments that are gorgeous and capture to the point of getting the whole shot in the best light and not losing too much in the chaos camera as I call it.-It was so much fun, and unlike others, did not get lost too much in the over CGI that it became cheesy to separate the lines between reality and fake.The Heart
-It's been a long time since I've been moved by a movie and even longer since a Marvel movie did it for me, but GOTG 3 did it well.-I did not cry, but man did I feel it so hard in watching things unfold and the relative plots come to life with my characters.-This film hits a lot of deep topics but never to the point of losing the pace and adventure aspect, timing it to make the most opportune moments to share, and then bringing it to the full moment b putting the resolution in the story.-So much depth and the fact comedy is there to help relieve things without ever losing touch of that core character, you just don't get that quality of balance in a lot of movies.-Perhaps one of the best stories to come out of the MCU...ever.The Character Usage
-And this isn't a movie that is gauged to just one character like they often try to do.-No, GOTG for me uses the characters extraordinarily well, and balancing them all to give the means of inclusion in the movie.-Star Lord has an Arc, Gamora, Drax, and Rocket all have these deep stories that dive further into the characters than we have seen, each story not fighting for time, but rather finding the right amounts of time to share.-But then they don't bleed into one another, but mix into such a blend that you got the full effects and did not miss anything. It allowed just about everyone to play and I loved just how connected EVERY aspect was.-Even the tertiary characters had good inclusion and chemistry and it all worked so well to continue this gradual evolution of the weird family.The Acting
-Is this the Oscars? Nope, not even close. And does it touch the performances of some of the DC and Marvel crew? No, it doesn't hit those that some hold to.-What it does do well though... is bring these performances that again make the comic book crew come to life and continuing to make me invest into the characters for another go.-The conveyance of hurt, the delivery of lines, the mannerisms and the swag that comes with these characters and it really made me think of this being op acting skill in the Marvel group, or at least one of them.Iwuji is a fantastic villain that is arrogant, boastful, brash, and theatrics to make you hate him, or depending on your morals love him, and make this very binding villain.-Pratt does his job well and gives Quill some bite, charm, and a wonderful balance that is fun and still his character, but not overwhelming.-But Cooper... man does Cooper give one of the best hits for me. Touching, but fun,, deep and yet not overdramatic, and I just loved how well he brought everything to the mix. What a performance.-It works everything together and gives you such dynamic chemistry that I don't have enough room to keep it going.The Comedy
-It's Guardians, it has to be funny. Again, the mission is accomplished and in a manner that was very balanced for me.-I said it earlier, but when you put comedy in tune with the story, pacing, and mood, you find me very impressed with it being added as a device.-Then you bring in the timing that is so well, and you find these ridiculous surprises hitting you at the right moments.-Add the nearly R rated moments that come into play, and Gunn's attitude with a leash really accomplished a lot in use, necessity, and fun.-It was all done quite amazing to the point it was nearly perfect for me, and kept me laughing the whole time at the dynamic spread that we got.The Pace
-Was incredible, an entertaining bout of everything at a pace that was balanced and respectful to the story and adventure.-Fast to keep things moving and getting to the end, yet slow enough to stay on the story and give the buildup and emotion the full effect it needs.-I loved the depth of it all and not once did I feel bored or the movie too bloated as I was timing the pace of the movie.The Surprises
-The movie has lots of predictable things, but the movie throws in some intergalactic tricks to really keep you on your toes.-Changes in the plot are some of the biggest lines crossed and surprised, whilst the levels Gunn goes to convey the danger of this man are quite a shocker.-You'll find that the movie really has some things to mix up the formula and make a Marvel movie feel fun and exciting again.DISLIKES:Sometimes A Tad Too much Comedy
-It's rare, but this is a comedy central series so you can expect Gunn to cross the lines a few times.-The idiotic moments are some of the stale moments, while other times it's a running joke that has run too far for my liking.-Caution to those with younger people who don't want cursing, heavy insults, and some demoralizing moments as they are present in this film.Some More Graphic Stuff
-This movie also is a bit more mature than you might expect and not in the indirect way that they used to do.-The third installment of the movie does overstep some things and hit a more mature feel that you might not expect. It's violence alone will cause some to turn away, while the graphic nature and design feel like only a censor shy of belonging to HBOMax.-And some moments with the animal cruelty and darker moments were a bit harder to watch and excessive, but the story component helps blunt that a bit.A Little More Action Early On
-The movie actually works well to build up action and give it some gusto, but I won't lie that I found it again geared towards comedy and not the action fest the trailers promised.-A little more of the end game's battle, (which was amazing) in a few earlier battles would have perfected this and given me just the right balance in this category.-Fortunately, there is so much other things that even this is a smaller dislike, though again there are still moments I would have done to help maximize the potential.The VERDICT:
Guardians of the Galaxy was Gunn's love letter to the series and he did it super well for me in showing that comic book movies still have some potential. It took so much pressure and made a diamond, a star amidst most of the modern that was an adventure I was hoping for. It's fun, funny, exciting and just full of the comic book feel I come to the movies for and escaping the madness of the modern day. But that doesn't mean it has lost the real factor that comes with the MCU and that makes for a deeper film that respected the characters built, the stories made, and further dives into them to make such a spectacle. I loved so much of the balance in it and the way they got the Galaxy running again. Sure, it is going to be debatable on the violence, graphicness, and darker tones and there is some fine tuning that could be done. But in the current state of Marvel, it shined for me and is worth a trip to the theater definitely. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.","5/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cahidi","29 July 2023","I think it's safe to say that this is the best Guardians Of The Galaxy movie so far. It revealed Rocket's dark past and told us about the future for the rest of the Guardians. But one thing that really touched me is the smile on Nebula's face. I thought I'd never see the day, yet here it is. She even laughed! That's so touching, she finally becoming a true family member of the Guardians. And even though Gamora isn't the same as before, she's still there. Even if she's not with the Guardians anymore. Another thing that I like about this third volume, is that Kraglin finally mastered Yondu's arrow. I'm looking forward to the next volume of the Guardians Of The Galaxy.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","tzielinski-92004","5 May 2023","The group's journey in this movie may not have been overly original, but a good combination of Rocket's past as well as the events the preceding from the other installmenta bring forward a beautiful and emotional end to the trilogy. An interesting villain that showed intelligence as well as notable power didn't overshine new lovable characters and the core group. Character development was instrumental to making this movie great with the depth of each scene making every line hit close to home. Each character was given their own time to shine and shine they did. A couple forced lines and some interesting CGI choices are all that keep this from being in the conversation of best Marvel movie to date.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dex_90","13 August 2023","Similar to other late Marvel movies, full of tired jokes that are played out by now.Script writing and plot that seems to lack any coherence or consistency.They start off by wanting to ""save Rocket"", in the process they invade several high-security facilities, put thousands of lives at risk including their friends and their own, watch as a planet with presumably billions of sentient creatures gets blown up without trying to do anything to save it (or them). Then once again put an entire settlement with thousands of people's lives at risk and have it invaded (Knowhere) to save a few of their friends lives that decided to board the big bad's ship in a ""funny"" scene and then decide that they have to save a few hundred children or animals because as opposed to the creatures on the planet these ones really matter.In the process they sometimes decide to horribly injure or murder random people like guards or a scientist while sparing the life of the big bad that just blew up a planet, because... reasons. Maybe his ugly face triggered a bout of sympathy or they are suddenly ""the Guardians"" or something.It all doesn't really make any sense anymore. Spaceships go Woosh, Guns go Bang or Pew, Planet and Space Station go Boom.""Did that look cool?"" No, no it didn't.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","jssfranch","4 May 2023","This movie is genious when it comes to the psychology of the characters. They all have very extreme and crystal clear personalities. Each and every character of the movie comes through in equal terms and the focus is on the group and their relationships. Disfunctional and lovable relationships just like in real life.A special mention to the impossible/amazing duo Mantis-Drax. She is an empath raised in total isolation, which is a contradiction per se, and he is a total sociopath that means no harm. Together they become a total clash of extremes that gives your ears and eyeballs one of the best cinematic experiences of pure heart-moving friendship. Just genius. Kudos also to Nebula and her character development, from villain to hero, with a huge-huge heart.All and all, a beautiful, moving, heart-warming film.I'd like to thank the entire team for this amazing experience.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","HabibieHakim123","6 May 2023","With every flaws that the movie have, the emotional weight that the movie carry, the chemistry, the performance, the action, the characters, the hero, and the villain, all works so well, making it one of the deepest superhero movie i've watch, The High Evolutionary was simply one of the best MCU villain, he is possibly second to Thanos in terms of menacing, not even Kang The Conqueror at least so far, and of course we need to talk about Rocket, James Gunn as not only the man that direct the film but also the man behind the writing's room, he deserve a major credit for the heart and soul his pouring writing basically the whole story but specifically Rocket's backstory, a depressing and sad backstory that simply broke our hearts but it solid and perfect, and really because of that i think everybody will looking at Rocket's character differently from now on, the rest of the crew is still who they are, and though Adam Warlock did have a cool badass scene, i did wish to see him do something more in the film, a little bit too long, but overall Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 was another proof of Gunn's ability to not lose focus on the characters especially in this third movie, something that Taika Waititi has messed on Thor, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 was another solid installment in the trilogy, second best after the first one and definitely better than Vol. 2, by the way, the movie also almost making me cry 4 times, the fourth being the unexpected twist that are just perfect, it's a true emotional rollercoaster.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","theoneaman","8 May 2023","James Gunn and the team has found a formula that I can watch the results of over and over again. The hardest thing is knowing there aren't any plans for Volume 4 & 5 and you have the Fast Saga with 10 movies. It's absolutely criminal when you think of that.This volume, was perfectly written and brought to life. What helped is knowing there was a clear vision and a group of filmmakers motivated and inspired by that vision, all working together to make it happen.I would imagine there's so much more still to explore; Peter and Gamora's love story, adventures of Drax and Mantis, rebuild of Knowhere, so many untapped villains and so many civilizations yet to be explored.Totally gutted by his movie, towards the end you could easily have tears full, not ready to say goodbye :(","7/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","snowyprecipice","15 May 2023","I went in without watching any trailers, because I wanted to experience it without any sort of spoilers. It exceeded my expectations completely! There was a nice blend of humour, sentiment, tragedy, love and I felt like every character got their time to shine. There were no cheap plot points and the action was well paced. Didn't feel any boredom unlike other recent marvel movies.It was a little darker, especially with some mild gore, but it added to the weight and themes of the movie. The voice acting by Bradley Cooper was amazing. It was a bittersweet ending to the trilogy but somehow I feel a little excited for what's to come!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","vrpqqzxp","31 July 2023","To be honest when I first watched the movie in the theatre I wasn't sure if it would be good. Like there is this thing that as more films are released for the trilogy it get worse and more bad, but in the guardians of the galaxy trilogy it's just ain't like that, every movie of the trilogy is good. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to the third movie but then my friend forced me to come with him, and it was SO MUCH FUN I wa in shock when Sylvester Stallone came out of nowhere. But the movie was so funny and say and the action was also good and I had so much fun. I cried a lot during the movie but that's what make movie a good movie doesn't it? In my opinion of course, most of the movies I liked the most are the movies that I cried the most. In my opinion, when the movies gets me into a emotional mood they're good, 'cause I think action and fights it is not all about the movie, there need to be emotions in the movie who will make the people who watching the movie feel something. I think if the movie is just action and fight it is a little big boring, and I'm fan of action movies but there is need to be things that. Will evoke emotions in the crowd who watching the movie. In my opinion emotional scene in movies it is very important. And in conclusion, for those who haven't seen the movie, you absolutely should.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TharsheyN","10 July 2023","A solid ending to the Guardians Of The Galaxy trilogy. This film focuses mainly on Rocket and his past, with a sprinkling of Gamora x Peter and more weirdly some Peter x Nebula it would seem.The storyline is pretty good; Peter starts of depressed, nothing like the old leader he once was until Rocket is injured and that spurs him into taking charge once again. The rest is the adventure they take part in to heal him back up.The casting was well the old cast who are all perfect in their roles plus a new villain who definitely did a good job playing his character. Equal parts, mad, good, scientist and psychopath.The VFX and SFX were pretty good, the CGI especially was better then the past few Marvel movies and that is something to be thankful for for sure.Anyway overall really enjoyed the movie compared to previous marvel offerings. A solid 7/10 for me, good acting, storyline and ending plus a much better CGI then expected from Marvel nowadays.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","cmarlborough","8 May 2023","By far the best Marvel film since Endgame, and so anticipated in our house that we were all really excited by the time the trailers finished. I was worried that it wouldn't live up to the weight of expectation but James Gunn is a master and, thank goodness, was given free rein to make something truly special. The music was great, dipping into the 2000s perfectly. The story focuses on Rocket this time and is heartbreaking in places. There is more gore and swearing in this film that any we have seen so far which might be problematic for more sensitive kids, but my kids (8&11) loved it.The film is long but doesn't feel it at all, the pace is consistent and the timing is brilliant, with a mix of classic Guardians humour and serious, character developing plot lines.In particular there are a few stand-out moments. Peters conversations with Gamora are really heartfelt, all the young Rocket scenes are sad and borderline traumatic, Drax character arc is fabulous, there are a couple of near-death scenes that brought us all to tears and I love that Peter's family finally find out that he is alive and well at the end (I hate loose ends!)
There are two end credit scenes in which the prospect of both another guardians film and a future Starlord appearance are set up so worth a watch.Overall I loved it.To watch this and understand every reference you need to watch the first two films, plus Infinity Wars, Endgame and the holiday special.","10/10"

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","dalimilzrubek","4 August 2023","The last Guardians film isn't perfect, it is rough on the edges with uneven pacing, but it has a heart. Lot of it. It is darkly twisted, gritty, hilarious, touching. Everyone leaves their caricature shells behind, they grow and they deal. It is the most adult, down to earth instalment in the Guardians trilogy but at the same time the most insane, over-the-top soup of craziness. When the end credits roll, the nostalgia levels are through the roof, tears are rolling down the cheeks.We couldn't wish for a better goodbye. It might look like a new hope for the struggling post-Endgame MCU but I'm afraid it is just the last echo of the good old past.","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","coynieuk","10 July 2023","This is Good film and because of the distance from the Main MCU line it works The action and the CGI are great the FX and make up are great the story is fine the bad guy is a bad guy and people stay dead I thinkThey go back to the basics they worked in the Vol.1 and 2 they take the to be nice nutters of the MCU and put them on a ship told a very good story about defeating the actual and imagined demons The movie moves so fast you don't get to ask why and that's good because after wards you willThey keep the story in this case focused selfishly on the crew and their attached friends and family and this time as far as I can see there is no link to the main MCU story I could be wrong here so be kind. Only one surprise in the story for me as I know the RR story from way back so I was more focused on the other bitsIts not perfect way to much this is the last time we will see each other but they have space ships so em maybe not G and Neb managed fine. The absence of G was frankly week and the hole I am not your G was week before the end of Avengers and the split was what a long week ends difference that must have been a hell of a (Hangover) weekend murderess wack job too Super Hero in 3 - 4 days or one kiss come onEvery one gets to say good by audience actors and characters despite again it being pointless that every one has a space ship and Neb and G managed it its like those scenes in USA TV Shows were we get a scene for no other reason than its the last season episode and its nice but whyHere we get the added bonus of watching the heroes at their super best working hand in glove perfection to kill a lot of (innocent) slave soldiers after the big bad guy had blown up a planet and the heroes had well em ah done er (nothing) oh well they got a bit confused (I told you not to think about it)Look you don't go to GotG film to examine the motivation involved by the evil charterer do we we go to see big bangs and space ships to see super hot characters being cool if the writers are OK we get a FF family dynamic and if your lucky you get Bumblebee humour this had all of them and to be frank it sits with the Suicide Squad and Vol. 1 and 2 a very good example of a Si-Fi fantasy Comic Book Movie and thank Goodness only one alternant character see it can do doneI have been a fan of GotG for nearly 30 years and have been reading RR since he was the second story in Transformers UK comics and I have to say this is not my outcome for my favourite Marvel characters but it is an (barely) adequate one despite the unnecessary (MCU) deaths along the way and I was at the end (ignoring the child soilder) content and entertained is the MCU back I hope so but I am not sure one swallow dose not a summer make.","6/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","ttreakle","3 August 2023","The guardian's are back for one last ride and man it was a hell of a good time!!!! From the opening sequence showing us rockets back story to quill still grieving over gamora and the others trying to get along and finish what they started. The villain in the movie is by far one of the best in the MCU. I have to admit I cried when we almost lost one of the character's and for a minute I thought drax was going to be gone. I love the beef between nebula and mantis.at the end of the day though the way it ended with each character doin there own thing was a great way to send them off. The new guardian's looked good to. Great movie and I highly recommend it.Tim Treakle.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","sansanxaverius-76886","3 May 2023","I love how they make this one. The joke is fresh, gomora, mantis and nebula steal the show with their anger. But one thing, this movie reveals the history of Rocket Raccoon, and man, it is a sad story.The overall story is quite simple actually, but along the way, the story itself reveals the dark sad story about Rocket Raccoon, and boy i cried just looking at a walrus waving his hand gently.You should watch this one for real, this is so far the best from the Guardian trilogy. The characters, the humour, the action sequence, all spot on, i was leaving the cinema with the smile and dry tears in my cheek.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","spaulagain","20 August 2023","The first Guardians film is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has such an incredible ensemble of comedy, music, campiness and heart that resulted in what to me is a perfect film. Easily in my top 10 along side Empire Strikes Back and Shawshank.Volume 2 was great as well, but began to show the limits of Gunn's follow through. It overplayed the comedy, and didn't feel like an adventure.Volume 3 is unfortunately even more subpar for the trilogy. From the beginning scenes, it felt rushed and contrived. From there on the whole film circled around Rocket's backstory which after the whole Ego thing, seemed quite repetitive. The story really only became a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" in the last 20mins or so, and that was really just a convenient circumstance.Sure Rocket's backstory pulled some heartstrings, but it also left the rest of the film scrambling to make sense of it all and create a plot with it. The humor was attempted, the plot was contrived, and the characters all felt like they were just their for a ride rather than driving the story with their decisions.Vol. 3 is a disappointing end to the trilogy. Certainly better than any recent MCU film, but by far the weakest in the trilogy. Oh well.","9/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","Scar38","23 July 2023","When it first started I kept wondering what the hell I was watching, it was like a slapstick comedy, I was starting to get worried that the clown James Gunn had ruined it, but it got so much better as it went along. I love all the Guardians of the Galaxy, they have all been phenomenal throughout the trilogy, especially my favourite characters Peter Quill, Nebula and Drax, the film was so good and entertaining, full of excing action and some genuine tear jerking moments and I have to say the ending was very fitting, even though I'm kind of gutted we won't be seeing the gang anymore.I just hope nobody tries to remake or make another sequel, without our favourite characters, as it just won't work.So, apart from the rather silly start, it turned out brilliant, I loved it.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","rannynm","5 May 2023","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the perfect end to this Marvel trilogy. It's an emotional journey, and, for me, a bit of a tearjerker - bring some tissues. I connected strongly with the characters and throughout the movie deeply cared about them. I also love this movie because of the strong messages, astonishing CGI and the ""marvelous"" acting.This movie switches between Rocket's (Bradley Cooper) backstory and the mission to save Rocket embarked on by Star Lord/Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Groot (Vin Diesel), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Drax (Dace Bautista), and Mantis' (Pom Klementieff). The new Gamora (Zoe Salda√±a) also joins them, but she isn't the same Gamora we knew. Can the Guardians save Rocket and the galaxy in time? Watch to find out! As always, make sure to stay until the end of the credits!Guardians of the Galaxy is one of my favorite franchises within the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), and director James Gunn and the actors are the biggest reasons why. Gunn has made these movies unique and distinct from the other Marvel movies. Although it's still funny, this movie resonates emotionally with the audience more than the first two Guardians. You can feel the pain and traumatic experiences of the characters. Star Lord as Chris Pratt is perfect. I've never seen a role as good as this one for Pratt, and for me he will always be Peter Quill. Even though Rocket is completely CGI, Bradley Cooper's voice performance makes me believe he is real. My favorite character is Drax (David Bautista) because he is very sweet and funny, and whenever he's on screen, I enjoy it immensely.The message of this movie is that friendship and teamwork are the most powerful forces in the galaxy. This movie contains some profanity, violence, and some gross scenes.I give Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 4 out of 5 stars, and I recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Marvel and Guardians of the Galaxy fans will definitely enjoy this movie. It comes out in theaters on May 5, 2023. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!","10/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","TheMysteriousReviewer","7 May 2023","After a few years of people hyping up the events after Infinity War with a movie like this, I can easily say that it was definitely worth the wait. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is an awesome conclusion to the trilogy. Sure, I wouldn't consider this perfect like the first one with some minor jokes that don't stand out. But it won't stop me from having a great time thanks to an engaging story, great characters that give their backstory that fit for the movie, great humor, top notch action that keeps the movie exciting, and amazing visuals that make the galaxy look like anyone would like to explore. For those that loved the previous two, or especially those that want to see this for after the events of Infinity War, I highly recommend this one. This movie has given the Guardians a farewell they deserve.","8/10"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3","joshuaonofrio","20 May 2023","I see some 1/10s. It's not that bad.The movie is rated PG-13.I agree I wouldn't let a 5-10 year old watch this. But do some research, it took me two seconds to find out what's in this movie.We literally have information at our finger tips.I also saw a bad soundtrack review. The music is great once again.This is not a perfect movie and it suffers from mcu-ness.However the good parts shine so well.All the characters are given ample screen time and move the narrative forward. I feel Drax was the most underused, but he had some heartfelt moments too.This movie is a reminder that the directors love for a project can really shine through.I couldn't help but think I'm excited to see what Gunn does with the DCEU (or dcu, or whatever they are calling it)Legend for mcu-ness:
Some of the gci was not great
Cheesy out of place jokes
Ruined scenes for jokes
Cookie cutter bad guys (although this one was almost really good - the whole concept around him was good)Overall this is a good movie. It's pretty violent, a little nasty at times, and some scenes involving animals might be hard to watch.Oh and no star lord helmet :( I don't know why I wanted to see it.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Gordon-11","15 December 2021","This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!","6/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","gbill-74877","31 March 2022","A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it's frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.On the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I'm all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn't care for how na√Øve Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to ""fix"" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","masonsaul","15 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Neptune165","19 March 2022","Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humorless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that ""my back"" joke and Norman Osborn repeating ""I'm something of a scientist myself"". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.This movie certifies that Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility and MCU Spider-Man lacks that. He's had 6 movies and still acts like an inexperienced, immature, not independent, not smart and acts like a rookie. And the whole plot started because he couldn't think of an alternative to get him and his friends to college so he got Doctor Strange to go and make a spell so that everyone will forget that Peter is Spider-Man(also doing it without his friends consent). And of course with Peter being the doofus he is, he messes up the spell which causes the multiverse to collide. There's a reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him. One of Spider-Man's best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears). You'd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains in Far From Home but no; he does it again which caused Aunt May's death. It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be ""cured""(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It's also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you're like ""yeah this guy sucks"" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May's death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben's infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn't even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight.Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason.","4/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","IPyaarCinema","21 December 2021","Review By Kamal KI don't think this film was written well. It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom's Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark's mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter's whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn't experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn't leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the ""jokes"", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom's Peter? Bad writing at its finest.Yes, this whole movie could've been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU's portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland's acting is great.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","BandSAboutMovies","18 December 2021","It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write.","9/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","andrewchristianjr","15 December 2021","Superhero extravaganza! Spider-Man NWH didn't meet my expectations, it exceeded them. The most emotionally resonant MCU film so far. This movie is worth every excruciating moment we had to wait. The visuals, the score, the emotions, the story, and ofc the fan-service. This film understands spider-man fans like no other spider-man film before it. Truly a celebration of the most beloved character in the best way possible!","6/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","blott2319-1","24 December 2021","I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post ""Into the Spider-verse"" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was ""really, we're going there?"" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","paul_haakonsen","12 March 2022","Right, well I am by no means a fan of superhero movies, but I will watch them when given the chance. Why? Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don't they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" here in 2022.Actually, my family went to watch ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn't go, as I don't think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.Visually then ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn't it?""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of ""Spider-Man"" in general.My rating of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","16 December 2021","This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D. And once you've seen it, please don't spoil it for others, just like you won't want it spoiled for yourself.","2/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","statuskuo","6 January 2022","It most likely Sony has to continue to soft re-boot this exhausting tedious story in order for them to maintain rights. In this case, it throws the entire kitchen sink including nods to the multiverse.In this one Peter Parker rues the day people discover he is Spiderman. And in order to allow his friends to live a normal life he goes to Dr. Strange to conjure up a spell so he would be forgotten. Seriously. The entire movie is predicated on a stupid wish. Well obviously that goes wrong and a dimension portal opens to different worlds where villains dont recognize the present casted Peter Parker. Seems clever on paper but it is a slog. The only gimmick is that we see Peter Parkers from previous flicks. What you get are momentum killing conversations between the Spideys. Which, for fans, suppose it's great to shoehorn legacy. For people who are too young to know anyone of the previous ones. Im sure theyll be confused.This entire movie moves at a snails pace and suffers from bloat. You can slash a half hour and still be fine. This culminates in the death of Aunt May. Because, if you follow the storylines Spidermans have to have a loved one die at their own stupid decisions. When will that end?I suspected this would be the typical messy CGI garbage. And it didnt disappoint. It is greenscreen heaven.There is a better story here. This one felt unnecessary.","3/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Oh_Capital","19 April 2022","It took me a while to get around to watching No Way Home. There was so much hype, and people were declaring 'the hype is real.'I feel alone on an island thinking this movie is terrible. I get that people were psyched about all the old Spider-Man characters coming together for a big super fun time, but that does not cover up for how nonsensical everything is in this film. (Spoilers incoming)First the good. This will be a short segment. The idea to bring all the characters from the previous Spider-Man movies together through the multiverse is an awesome concept. The execution however was lazily conceived.The two constant problems in the movie are the cringey dialogue and the incomprehensible decision making. The movie starts with Peter Parker's identity being revealed. Now if your identity is revealed where is the last place you want to go? The answer is your house. It appears no one told the writers this because that is where Parker goes. Also, Parker ask's Strange to put a spell on the world so his friends can go to MIT? How is that his rationale? Yes it gives purpose for the rest of the film but it's a lazy story telling way to get there. Why would Dr. Strange agree at all to that. He is a freaking wizard.There is not a single line of dialogue that is intelligent. It's all cliches, lines that have been in previous movies, or just pop culture language with no substance. Towards the end I was cringing at the back and forth between characters, especially when Goblin says ""I'm something of a scientist myself."" Yes we know that when you said it 20 years ago. (I loathe fan service.) There were a couple jokes that landed but overall I was laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny, like when all the Peter Parkers were in the lab with their goggles and test-tubes finding cures for the villains in less than 5 minutes. Again, lazy writing.This is a movie for children who have no concept of reality or care about a well thought out story. (End rant.)","4/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","elliotjeory","27 March 2022","I was disappointed, they have run out of ideas so they bring out Spider-Man greatest hits.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","FixedYourEnding","20 March 2022","I feel sad to be living in a time where a movie like this can get high ratings. This movie is for low-attention-span adrenaline-immuned viewers, which unfortunately there are more and more of. Unless you are a group of teenagers looking for a night-out, I would not recommend this movie at all.I didn't expect much from this movie other to be an entertaining comic-book-like story. Boy, was I disappointed. It has been no more than a collection of random fight scenes with incoherent story and almost random dialogues in-between. Also, I think the casting of Spider-man, M. J. and Aunt May are just horrible. Tom Holland appears to have the brain of a 10-year old, and Zendaya is great in other films, but as MJ she just doesn't work, same goes for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) she looks way too young, flirty and brainless, exact opposite of what this character should be.Overall it is a slaughterhouse to everything that spider-man should stand for. It is concentrated around universes and egocentric personal problems instead of being a moral model of real-world problems. The 2.5 hours long movie seem to just be an adrenaline shot one after the other, no substance and nothing to learn from. I'm sadden by having to write this, the production quality is great but where is a plot, a moral and generally being a better person. Sony should be ashamed of themselves for dragging Stan Lee's creation through the mud like that and Marvel should consider terminating their license for this creation. Seriously.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","cricketbat","17 December 2021","They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing! Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging. I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kosmasp","20 December 2021","There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many ""climactic"" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where ""magic"" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ...","5/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jaapeelman","21 March 2022","I really do NOT understand the high score for this movie.The storyline is idiotic and childish with monsters and spider-men coming from different dimensions all because some spell from dr.

The special effects are as expected great but the rest is really a bunch of nonsense!I love Spider-man, Batman, the Hulk etc but this movie is really terrible and I wasted 148minutes precious time.Take my word for it: the best thing to do is to skip this movie and wait for something better to watch, which is not hard as there are not many movies as dumb as this one!","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Criticalstaff","14 March 2022","It might be the worst movie ever made. Not just because it is bad, but because of the misuse of all the resources that went into making it.I will be the first to admit that I have propensity to look for meaning when I am watching a film. Be it the straight-forward moral of the story or a higher meaning, something to make you think. That is how I enjoy cinema the most, when it gives me something to think about. Big or small. When the images on the screen are about something more than simply the images on the screen.This film is the complete opposite of it. Its meaning is inward-looking. It is not interested of looking at anything other than itself. It is complete and utter navel-gazing. That really is the crux of the film. That is the reason why this is barely watchable. Every flaw and mistake comes from this movie's own excessive self-contemplation.Where to put the blame is a different question. It has been established for some time that these MCU films are not ""directed"". There is no singular vision behind them and it boils down to an assembly line. The plot and dialogue are so bad I can't imagine anyone put any amount of thought into it. All the lines do actually feel like ad-libs the actors improvised on the day. Visually there is an absence of flair (and I am being generous) which is on par for the course for these movies by now. The soundtrack and sound design is, of course, forgettable. The editing is conventional. The set design is reminiscent of those real-estate videos where celebrities show their homes. The costume design is ok, again which is not shocking knowing the means that were allocated to this.The acting could have been the saving grace of the movie. Unfortunately, Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are the stars of the film. And while their performances are good, they usually have to share the screen with (multiple) Oscar-winners. It is jarring to see the best talent doing what is basically glorified background work. That is why this is the worst movie of all time. You have a film packed with the best actors working today, but we have to follow Tom Holland's inane struggle on how to apply to some college.I am not even sure I want to go into the plot. In truth it does not matter. I suspect that even the makers of this took that as a given. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now morphed into a never ending reference and call-backs machine. That is the core of this film: ""remember this?!"" The structure of it is one of a TV show, except in TV there is an A-plot and a B-plot. This film is all B-plot.As I am writing this, this film has been viewed by millions and is one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Please kill me now.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mhorg2018","20 December 2021","This is the best film Marvel has released this year. Shang-Chi was only ok, the Venom sequel was atrocious, Black Widow was so-so, Eternals was bland for the most part. What makes this one work is the cast, but the story really, when examined is weak. The last movie put the writers in a corner while revealing (a silly idea really) Peter's identity to the world. He goes to Doctor Strange without thinking about what he really wants, and ends up, in typical spider-man fashion, in screwing everything up. So, also in usual Spider-Man style, by trying to fix things up, he totally messes up further. In the end this costs him a lot. While this movie starts out well, the middle is dull and why should Peter care about beings from alternate realities? And by 'fixing' them, did he erase the events of those films, making the spider-men of those realities unnecessary? Peter loses everything due to his listening to Aunt May, who's advice is illogical and gets her killed. Well, I can say this was the best of Holland's trilogy, but it still isn't Spider-Man 2. A few sides: Molina, Garfield and Maguire's returns were the best part of this movie. Those three steal every single scene they're in. Dafoe was good as Norman, but I could have done without Electro and Sandman who added little to the story. While others are falling over themselves gushing over this, I think I may be suffering from Superhero fatigue.","10/10"

I was so happy to see my childhood come to life.This was a incrediblely told story about The 3 peters and how deep responsibility truly is, I'm shocked with excitement in we had the great men themselves return to their respective roles which included Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Thomas Haden church and many more. I've always been a massive fan of Tobey & Andrew so seeing them come back was the ultimate time of my life. I loved every second of it, i wanted to review this with no spoilers but that is literally impossible ao i now have +1 Spoiler review.There were so many nods and callbacks to the past which i thoight went very well & Garfield finally avenged not saving gwen!Highly Recommend!

Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.A heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.A memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.""Rating: A.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","atlasmb","11 March 2022","My expectations for this film were off the chart due to what I had heard and read about how great it is. What it does deliver is plenty of spectacle. But a great film needs more than that. The story also moves along with some pace. But emotional impact should never be sacrificed for expediency. In short, this is an enjoyable film, but there have been better Marvel films.There is one scene that stands above the rest. And it is guaranteed to bring a smile to the lips of any Marvel fan. It has so much subtext and it is so unexpected.It ends with a tee-up for the next chapter, of course. I just hope that one focuses more on the characters and less on the effects. It certainly has that possibility, given where this episode ends.","3/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","EpicMovieCompilations","16 December 2021","When Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire enter the movie, the cinema rightfully erupts into a hail of cheers and applause. The experience of Spider-Man: No Way Home is bizarre. Not only do you spend half the runtime just waiting for the return of a familiar face, but grow weary of the current cast which've headlined the previous MCU entires. Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon cannot hope to carry a film on its own terms, therefore No Way Home relies and depends on the presence of legacy. Far From Home (2019) was borderline unwatchable. Cheap-looking, tone-deaf and accompanied by a forced, cringeworthy romance (which doesn't improve here by the way) it is surely the worst Spider-Man movie of all time. This threequel holds the unfortunate title of runner-up. It shares many of the same problems...First of all; technicalities. As with most MCU movies, the cinematography is flat and the colour palette is dulled for no apparent reason. The action set-pieces aren't very inventive and hold no iconography, always taking place on a boring, painfully obvious green-screened environment. Why does the Statue of Liberty look like that!? Why has the Lizard's design regressed from 2012, and why do they recycle and super-impose B-Roll footage of Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman, or Rhys Ifans as Curt Conners? It's so lazy.Aunt May's death barely affects me emotionally, because thus far she's been portrayed as this bubbly, whimsical character with very few scenes of actual conviction. Can you imagine if this was Rosemary Harris or Sally Fields' Aunt May? The difference in my reaction would be night and day. Moral of the story, don't cast the most gorgeous woman alive as Aunt May... Speaking of conviction, why does this film feel the need to inject a cheap gag whenever it's in proximity to a remotely serious scene? These screenwriters have to go back to basics, and refresh themselves on the fundamentals of tone. Not to mention, most of the MCU's humour so infrequently lands, and caters to the lowest common denominator audiences. That's not to say there aren't a few smart quips here or there, but for the most part, I was confused by the amount of chuckles surrounding me.No Way Home is, clinically, a bad movie. Take for instance, the First Act. Much of the world wants Spider-Man hunted down and defeated. He's interrogated once, and then freed on behalf of a pointless cameo by Daredevil himself, Matthew Murdock. Like, what? There's no ramifications. He just gets to live his life despite being an enemy of the state. Does the world think he partook in a terrorist plot or do they think he snatched a candy from a convenience store? I'm a little confused. I guess the consequence is that Ned and MJ don't get into MIT... Big deal. I don't care. These are poorly written characters. Bring on the multiverse villains!What can I say on that front..? I was grinning from ear-to-ear in seeing Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina), Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) back again. Hearing their musical cues gave me goosebumps, as did some of their dialogues... It's a testament to the actors. There's some serious talent in The Sinister Six. I love their interactions. For a second you'll think to yourself how cool it all is, how you should just be thankful a film like this is even possible... But again, why have it at all if it isn't done correctly? Take for instance, the final battle, with one of the glaring objective errors of the film... Tobey's swingin' around, pulling off epic Spidey stunts, and there's no hint of Danny Elfman's beautiful theme... Same goes for Andrew Garfield, who had the privilege of having two great themes by James Horner and Hans Zimmer respectively. What was Michael Giacchino thinking!? He already dabbled in old themes for the villains, so why not for the heroes? If the movie is dead-set on fan-service and and legacy (which it most certainly is) then why on Earth not include these terrific tunes? Instead we just get orchestral renditions of Tom Holland's theme, which utterly PALES in comparison! It's just the same progression of notes.On to the Spider-Men themselves... Andrew Garfield has probably solidified himself as my favourite after watching this, while Tobey Maguire remains legendary by default since he was my childhood Spidey. Tom Holland doesn't come close. I never liked him in the role because he's not tangible. He's too pure and honest; thereby becoming illegitimate as a realistic humanistic interpretation. For whatever reason, Tobey Maguire gets stabbed, fatally it seems, by the Green Goblin. Thing is, he survives... So why bother scaring us? The moment doesn't serve a purpose, other than to provide a sudden, stupid shock for the poor audience. Ultimately, each of the villains fade away, back to their own universes. It's totally anti-climactic, not to mention there's no rematch or even a solid dialogue exchange between the Green Goblin and Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. Malpractice from a storytelling standpoint; odd, considering that on the other hand you have a terrific scene where Andrew's Spider-Man catches MJ from falling to her death, as he failed to do so with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)... Does narrative closure not apply to all facets of these films? Or did the writers just get forgetful for Tobey? Either way, the ending leaves much to be desired and leaves you wondering: what was the point?Individually, scenes work well. But this isn't a clip show. It's a film. To conclude, No Way Home is a mess. One which nearly totally collapses prior to Andrew and Tobey's appearance. Their scenes are fantastic, and all criticisms aside for one minute, I am grateful I got to see 'em on the big screen one last time. I love it when they bond over shared losses, and Andrew and Tobey's little exchange in the lab... No Way Home is an occasional treat, however nonsensical and pointless on the whole.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","alindsayal","15 December 2021","Finally, the biggest film Spider-Man: No Way Home has hit cinemas and I had to go see it as early as possible. Now I have watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Man's secret identity revealed, he tries to get Doctor Strange's help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause problems for both of them.Main Character
Tom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see how he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world. He doesn't have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I thought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.Supporting Characters
Zendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything that goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels natural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really good, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some really interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character. Jacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character that supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is back as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce off and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in their roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.Story
The story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of a character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for me was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their characters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.Script
MCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is really handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didn't outweigh the serious and darker parts of the film.Style
The film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from the other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good, despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isn't really any filler here which is an impressive feat.Overall
Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I have just watched the film but I can't find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will find this film plenty of fun.Rating - 10/10.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","JohnDeSando","17 December 2021","Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Peter (Tom Holland): ""The problem is you trying to live two different lives. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it becomes!""Notwithstanding the ""home"" in the title, the exciting new Spider-Man: No Way Home is more about the existential need to create one's own identity, the Christian need to give up a life in order to gain it, and the human need for a second chance. Many super-hero movies continue to emphasize the hero's need to recover a parent or child even more than the need to sacrifice for the good of humankind.As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggles with the attention he gets because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) revealed his identity, he gets involved with Dr. Strange to erase his super-hero identity from everyone's memory. Fooling with Mother Nature never is good in these hyper-active fantasies, and it's true as Peter tries to get Dr. Strange to reverse his initial memory-erasing spell in order to remain in the minds of those he loves.Besides, what director Jon Watts and his writers are really interested in is pulling the three Spidies together (Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) to remediate former bad boys like The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Strange clears the way between parallel dimensions to let each Spidey's version of villains to come together for their cleansing.The imaginative and entertaining concept of getting these characters together proves not to be confusing but revealing of their generous natures and the benign fraternity of Spider-Men, adding the collaboration motif into their otherwise solitary lives.Although the digital gymnastics are impressive, beyond those is an attempt to flesh out character for both good and bad boys. Discoveries abound without super sentimentality or long exposition. Because the filmmakers have taken care to load meaning into most dialogue, the revealing third act takes the plot to dizzying heights while character spills out along the way.As more is found out about the heroes and the villains, the long road back to normalcy for Peter seems just about right, filled as it is with triumphs that come from working as a team (not a normal Spidey thing to do) to suffering the loss of dear ones to a better cause. It's a coming of age at any age and a satisfying display of character development that might be envied by indie films everywhere whose bread and butter is a similar attempt to show humans at their worst and best.Super holiday fare, yes; challenging, yes; amazed I am that comic-book stuff holds meaning amidst its visual splendor, yes.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","hellsbells75","2 January 2022","I watched this with no prior knowledge of the plot. I had heard rumours but not enough, so each cameo was a genuine surprise for me. Even with that element, I was left dejected.Why? Well, first of all it made no sense. It seemed a ridiculously contrived way of bringing back old villains and actors just for the nostalgia and fan nods without any real premise. It makes no sense that the all powerful all knowing Dr Strange would risk the stability of the universe to get a few kids into college. He knows far too much about actions and consequences to fall into that trap.And Peter's ridiculous idea to save the villains he doesn't know, who belong in another universe, and who have done despicable things to his own alter egos, using what...some science stuff that just happens to be in Happy's apartment? We never know quite how he builds these ""cures"", we just get blinded by movie science talk enough to understand that it's ""science"". Just like Peter trapping Dr Strange in the Mirror Dimension by using ""math"". It's like those old 80s movies where a computer whiz taps random things into a computer and it can do amazing things! How? We don't know, just shut up and eat your popcorn!The dialogue fell oddly flat too. I'm a Marvel fan and I enjoy the witty banter, one liners and emotional moments but this fell way short for me. The jokes weren't funny. The interplay between characters felt written by a kid trying to emulate Marvel wit. I just didn't feel it. The 3 Peters answering to Ned calling their name was just rubbish. It simply wasn't funny.And the sentimentality felt forced and false. They all cried so many times. Soaring music over the top. Tears and hugs and therapy. It descended into pathetic, and I didn't want to see good characters being pathetic. I get the angst and pain in previous movies but this was pointless and Peter literally destroyed everything including his last remaining family member over nothing. At least the other Peters' regrets were real. This was borne out of pure nonsensical decision making. He wanted to kill The Green Goblin. Why? He was only there because of Peter making ridiculous choices and Aunt May only died because she was as stupid and misguided as Peter. He was just doing what villains do given half a chance - a chance Peter gave him for no logical reason.The fact he saved them in the end was irrelevant and actually did a massive disservice to the previous movies. It devalues what those other Peters did and went through. You may as well cure them too by stopping them getting bitten by spiders in the first place if you're going to be that kind hearted and change history.Would those villains really want to go back to their universe a changed person anyway? They were flawed, broken and destroyed everything they loved. Now they get to go back all ""fixed""...to what? A broken destroyed world they ruined to no doubt face justice for it. Great, thanks Peter! I think their glorious deaths would have been better. Or are the other Spidermen supposed to smooth it all over when they return?And last but not least, the whole ""forget everyone knows who Spider-Man is"" thing is just crazy. As if Dr Strange hasn't learned enough from trying to do it the first time. Why forget Peter Parker completely? Why not just forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man so he keeps his friends etc? So there was Happy at Aunt May's grave not knowing this was her nephew? That makes no sense at all. What happened at the Statue of Liberty then? What did MJ and Ned remember?I came out of the theatre disappointed. It wasn't like MJ said. I actually expected not to be disappointed, which made it worse.","1/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","akoaytao1234","12 March 2022","It would be unfair to say that I never really laud as great films BUT I always admire this ability to create quality escapism.With all that, I think Spider-Man: No Way Home might be the first film of that series that I actually hate .Firstly, this film feels so juvenile to the point that it is annoying. I guess this is a film not really made for me. I found the way Hollands tries to plays up the good boy persona exceedingly off-putting AND not needed. Zendaya and the Filipino guy are just a figment on its story. They even tried to gentrify the ""other"" versions of Spiderman film. Funnily, I love all the treatment for the Original Spiderman characters. Otherwise, its a mixed bag.Secondly, I found the cause of conflict in the film so unnecessary. It does not make sense for me why and how it happened. It feels like watching a cash grab for fans.I mean the conflict of the film is that his presence as a superhero has such a negative effects to their live that they were ultimately banned to their collegiate school BUT it is contrast with a rally showing their popularity too. It is like be consistent film. Even the spell is hinged on the fact that they did not plan. They go on as if this is a thing he does every time BUT he just goes for it without really thinking through of the whatnots. Ultimately, the choice of Holland Peter to armchair psychologist ughh. Just watch it, its like a Bob the Builder-esque plot line.Ultimately, what really sour me about the film is the Dr Strange Conundrum. Why even watch when the consequences can be reversed and played on? I mean, he did had some in the end BUT is it really not deserved. As a viewer, I hate it from since the Avenger films BUT I hate it more so this time, because it actively says it can AND it can even personalize it.Overall, this is a pure cash grab for people who are watching it for the characters but not the content. Its pretty much anchored on a very weak premise AND feels like a connective tissue for things to come. [0.5/5]","4/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","MonsterVision99","29 December 2021","Well... at least it made me appreciate the Sam Raimi movies a bit more.Every character from past movies is done badly (in the case of the Raimi characters) or even worse (since The Amazing Spider-Man was terrible to begin with). They try to give Hollands Spider-Man a bit more development and growth but too little, too late.Utter garbage. Typical of Hollywood and the MCU.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","therapeuticsuicide","21 March 2022","They wanted to find an ingenious way to put all the Spider-Mans together... and they DIDN'T.And why would they bother?! What does this accomplish that's so special? They obviously wracked their writers brains to the point of mediocrity to settle for this very cheap excuse to combine all the different movie Spider-Mans in one movie apparently for the sake of novelty, because the story serves absolutely no purpose, AND it just resets everything for Tom Holland's Spider-Man, which makes the previous 2 films really inconsequential, on top of creating a dilemma for any future possibilities of featuring all of those villains we've now just seen, which technically Tom Holland could have had versions of in his own franchise. This film was a waste of time, and one of the very worst in the entire Marvel series. In my opinion, everyone involved in coming up with this concept should be fired.","2/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","potipiroon","26 December 2021","I decided to go see this movie because of the 8.9 rating, which was based on more than 200,000 reviews. Honestly, I am shocked. The movie was so boring that I actually fell asleep at one point. The plot was very childish and unnecessarily long. I heard that some people actually left the theater out of boredom. I assume the high rating was only possible because of such strong a fandom. Overall, I felt like I just lost 2.5 hours of my life.","7/10"

Sure some of the comedy doesn't quite hit, there are some pacing troubles and not every character has enough screen time to flesh out their character.But despite its problems, this film excels at listening to the fans and giving a spider-man movie that will be remembered as ending an era just as endgame is remembered for the avengers.","1/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","ajsporty","28 February 2022","Embarassing. Cheap fanservice. Nostalgia feeding. Plot points that make no sense. Awful action.

The few lines of dialogue he had brought me back to 2002.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","drqshadow-reviews","18 March 2022","Instantly loathing the publicity of being outed by the press, Spider-Man hits up the Sanctum Sanctorum to ask Dr. Strange for some mystical assistance. They cast a spell of wiped memory and screw it up, reality is torn, familiar faces invade different spaces... you know this, you've seen the trailer. It's the Sony/MCU equivalent of X-Men: Days of Future Past, with a stream of old band members coming out of retirement for a jam-packed farewell concert.One might hope that the results are a smidge better than that old X-Men reunion, and they are, but No Way Home also suffers from many of the same problems. Primarily, the overwhelming urge to stuff as much crap on the screen as possible, even when the audience is already exhausted. It tries to serve too many masters and, in the end, sufficiently serves none. There's fun to be had, especially when the oddball mix-and-match super-characters get the chance to escape the trappings of a broader storyline and simply converse as individuals. Those accessible human interactions have been a big strength for the two preceding Marvel Spider-Man flicks, and they reap great benefits here, each time the old guard mingles with the new.I wish we had more such moments, but the push to turn the MCU's most grounded franchise into another big-time tent pole attraction demands otherwise. In reaching for the next major event, they've overlooked the ""neighborhood"" part of ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man."" Actually, they might've forgotten the ""friendly"" part, too, because there's a whole bunch of angst spinning around Tom Holland's central performance. But that's more excusable: Peter Parker goes through a lot over the course of this hundred-fifty minutes, he progresses and matures as a character, and he's experienced equally dark times in the comics.No, the performances aren't the issue here, nor is the dialogue, which remains snappy and delightful. The primary culprit is the plot, bloating and careening in indeterminate (and often mindless) directions, making a lot of noise but not making a lot of sense. Dr. Strange hand-waves many explanations under the guise of mysticism, which is basically his thing, but so do the various Spider-Men. Important members of the supporting cast are marginalized and under-served. The city of New York, once an essential ingredient, is now barely a backdrop. Goalposts are moved, overshadowed, and then moved again. Rumor has it that script re-writes were still underway during filming, and it shows.This is messy. Lots of fun on certain occasions, but stifling and sludgy in others. It's a mixed bag, leaning more to the positive than the negative, but I don't know that I'm content with the way everything wraps up in the end. Where Homecoming and Far From Home both left me charged and anxious for the next step, No Way Home put me in a place of quiet acceptance. Feels like the franchise has aged, and that's not a great thing.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","akdjreview","15 December 2021","Following constant disappointment with Marvel movies, I had come to stop caring for or even watching any. But Spider-man has had a special place in my heart since a kid so I had to watch, especially after hearing rumours. To tell the truth, this exceeded my expectations with great power.With surprisingly good acting and great emotionally loaded scenes, No Way Home managed to capture something many Marvel movies fail. Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a story-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting never seen in the Marvel universe before.No Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which I think old fans will admire. Nevertheless, I believe this movie was fantastically done and little mistakes.No Way Home is a great movie I highly recommend. Especially to the Marvel fans like me that had gotten bored of the new stuff.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","lareval","15 December 2021","I do not think this is a totally perfect film: It is too damn easily to spoil it, probably the middle section is not as powerful as the start and the epic finale, some of the characters are thrown into the plot rather than enjoy a well developed evolution like Peter Parker himself and I was not exactly a fan of Holland's era due to a lackluster couple of previous solo films. But this third solo movie is his best film to date, one of the most impactful MCU & Superhero movies and one outing that redeems and answers all my complaints regarding what came before.Here, MCU's Peter Parker finally shows some cracks and faces true trauma, developing a true commitment to his own adventure even being extremely populated by plenty of beloved and nostalgic other ones. Here, Parker's Spider-Man finally gets to grown in me, being faithful to the source and ending his evolution within Avengers universe on a riprousingly high. The performances are really strong, the script covers its plotholes & weaknesses with energy, tragedy and fun so well mixed and the ending looks like a true ending to Holland's Spider-Man trilogy.An excellent entertainment and a shocking surprise. I did not buy any trailer nor stinger from this movie and I was blown away. Best Spider-Man movie tied with 'Spider-Verse' and Sam Raimi's 2004 sequel. See it now!","7/10"

This movie is too bogged down by exposition and has a saggy middle section that tries for heart-tugging drama -- why, why do these junk food movies try to be more serious than they should? -- but I will admit that the ending gave me the feels. I'm not really chomping at the bit to see where this story goes next, but it was fun enough seeing this movie with my 10 year old son.Grade: B.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Anurag-Shetty","16 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home takes place immediately after the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home(2019). After Mysterio reveals Peter Parker's(Tom Holland) true identity, Peter's world is turned upside down. Peter goes to Doctor Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch), to make the world forget he's Spider-Man. However, the spell goes awry & villains from the multiverse show up. Now, Peter will find out what it truly means to be Spider-Man.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an awe-inspiring film. Director Jon Watts has perfectly completed his Spider-Man trilogy. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The humor & the emotional scenes are on point, just like every other Spidey movie. You will cry, laugh and cheer till your voice gets hoarse. Tom Holland is spectacular as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Tom Holland further solidifies that his portrayal of the iconic superhero, is the best. Zendaya is outstanding as MJ. Holland & Zendaya share electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Jacob Batalon is superb as Ned Leeds. Jamie Foxx is brilliant as Max Dillon/Electro. Willem Dafoe is phenomenal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Dafoe proves yet again, why he's the best Spider-Man villain in the entire franchise. Alfred Molina is excellent as Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus. Thomas Haden Church is great as Flint Marko/Sandman. Rhys Ifans is impressive as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a must watch for die-hard and casual Spider-Man fans. Go & web up a whale of a time!","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","johnnyhbtvs27","16 December 2021","Went to see this opening day to avoid spoilers and boy was i pleased i did. Going in not knowing what was going to happen made the movie so much better. Seeing Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire & Tom Holland all together really is a fans dream and Marvel are giving so much fan service in all their movies lately it really is staggering.I feel most of all, the movie does well in giving Andrew Garfield some love as the Spider-Man character as he mostly gets a raw deal these days as his movies weren't as strong as Raimi's or MCU ones. Andrew Garfield was a good Peter Parker & Spider-Man, he just didn't get that film where he could really shine and this movie practically says as much.Managing to get so many villains to reprise their roles must have been a tall order (i was more surprised to see Thomas Hayden Church back than anyone).The story grips you right from the off as it takes place immediately after the second one & some of the twists and turns i found quite shocking (i should have known better about Aunt May but it still took me by surprise).The ending is really beautiful in a nice sort of way, seeing Peter interact with MJ after the fact is a real heartstring puller. It ends with a conclusion to the trilogy whilst leaving the door ajar for more Tom Holland Spider-Man movies (which if there is any justice, there will be).Tom Hardy's cameo at the end sets up Venom (or at the very least, a version of) to join the MCU, which should be a blast. The idea of Tom Hardy & Holland playing off of each other is cinematic gold.All in all, i think this is the strongest MCU Spider-Man movie and may be the ultimate one for massive Spider-Man fans. Sam Raimi could never have imagined 20 years ago whilst making Spider-Man (2002) that his characters would be still portraying themselves all these years later in the biggest cinematic universe and franchise ever, truly remarkable, just like this film.","9/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","MrDHWong","16 December 2021","""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is the third solo Spider-Man movie to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Tom Holland once again in the lead role, it goes without saying that this is the best live action Spider-Man film ever made and probably ever will be made for that matter.In the events after ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", the secret identity of Peter Parker (Tom Holland) as Spider-Man has been exposed to the entire world after his fight with Quentin Beck/Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). No longer being able to take the onslaught of media and public backlash, Peter seeks help from Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. However, during the casting of the spell, Peter accidentally causes things to go wrong, fracturing the multiverse and leading to the emergence of many villains from realities unfamiliar to this one.Aside from Batman, the superhero that has left the most impact on me personally is Spider-Man. In fact, the very first superhero film I ever saw at the cinema was the 2002 Sam Raimi-directed ""Spider-Man"" starring Tobey Maguire. I'd probably go as far to say it is that film I credit with helping to kick-start my fondness for the genre as a whole, paving the way for many others like it. With ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" acknowledging not only the original Raimi films but the Marc Webb-directed, Andrew Garfield-led ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films as well, there was bound to be a lot of speculation surrounding whether or not it could live up to all this hype. In short, the answer is a resounding yes.Not since ""Avengers: Endgame"" has a Marvel superhero film affected me on such an emotional level and not since the 2008 ""Iron Man"" film has a solo hero story left this much of an impact. Of course, to discuss my favourite parts would give away vital spoilers so I won't go into too much detail here. I absolutely love the amount of respect paid to each of these series of films. Even the divisive ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films, which I actually liked despite their flaws, are treated with just as much love and affection as their Raimi/MCU counterparts. Moments like these go beyond simple fanservice and are clearly there as a thank you to everyone who have stuck with this iconic hero for almost twenty years now. They certainly put a big smile on the face of this responsible 30-something adult.The concept of the multiverse was first teased back in ""Avengers: Endgame"" and further elaborated on in the Disney+ series ""Loki"". However, for the most part, those ventures had a proper sense of management preventing things from spiralling out of control. Here, everything feels like fair game. The stakes are at an all time high as these villains pour out from their respective universes to seek vengeance on their particular Peter Parker, not knowing that they won't find him here at all. Anyone who knows me will remember that I love stories that involve alternate realities and history, so to see something like this combined with a film about one of my favourite superheroes was nothing short of wonderful. This film keeps you on your toes as you anticipate who Spider-Man will fight next. Again, I won't reveal which of the villain fights excited me the most due to spoilers so all I will say is that each of them had at least one moment that made the young kid inside me very happy.Tom Holland has come a long way since we first saw him don the Spider-Man suit back in ""Captain America: Civil War"". His high-spirited youthfulness has not waned over the past five years since he still has that uncanny ability to entertain us with his unique take on the beloved hero. That's not to say he is only capable of light-hearted fun, as here we see him demonstrate some of his darkest acting to date. This film definitely isn't afraid to hit us hard in the feels at the most appropriate times, frequently delving deep into Peter Parker's emotional state at such an important point in his life.Additionally, I have finally come to accept Zendaya's performance as MJ. It has taken me three films but her version of the character has finally grown on me. Originally, I found her pessimistic attitude and willingness to bring the mood down highly annoying but she has now matured into a vital ally of Peter that I enjoy seeing on screen. Naturally, her chemistry with Holland feels genuine, considering the two actors are actually dating in real life with their romantic scenes adding that much needed heart to the film.I won't speak at length about any specific villain as that will give away major spoilers so all I will say is that seeing each of them again in one place was quite overwhelming, but this time in a good way. It's both amusing and surprising to see Raimi-era villains interact with Webb-era villains who are equally as confused as to why they have been transported into this universe. Something that certain Spider-Man films have come under fire for is their cramming of too many villains into one movie, leaving the story cluttered and incomprehensible. This time around, it actually works to the film's advantage since the idea of there being multiple universes following a different timeline has already been properly established. Something like this leaves things open for other multiverse-related oddities happening in future MCU projects, which excites me greatly.Since the film has set the bar so high, I can't help but wonder how the MCU will ever be able to top it. Like ""Avengers: Endgame"" before it, ""No Way Home"" should be treated as something of a watershed moment in the entire MCU. It succeeds in entertaining both longtime fans of the Spider-Man character who have been watching him for nearly twenty years while simultaneously serving the purpose as a great continuation of the ever-expanding MCU storyline. With that said, I think all fans of Spider-Man owe it to themselves to see this film as soon as possible. And yes, I do mean ALL fans.I rate it a solid 9/10.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","leestoych","17 December 2021","If this movie didn't have the 3 boys joining forces it would've been a 6/10 for me. What we got was a shaky plot with Ned whipping out doctor strange moves after 0 training and peter risking the universe collapsing for the lives of a few random villains. Lazy lazy writingAnd the end fight we had maybe 10 seconds of our 3 Spider-Men fighting together. The rest was choppy scenes of each character fighting their respective villians. Where was the unity? Thats what we wanted, some combo moves between the 3 at least :(There were obviously some great moments dont get me wrong but i feel people aren't really taking the movie for what it is. Deluded by the marvel hypeThis is what happens when the hype is too big. What was MJ's line on disappointment? Yeah it applies to this film.My 4 main issues...1. Ned mastering the Doctor Strange Ring instantly (0 training)
2. Peter's decision to steal the cube from doctor strange because he wanted to ""cure"" a few villains and consequently risk his universe
3. Needed a few more scenes where the spidermen fight in unison ( we got 10 seconds of them swinging together)
4. Tobey's entrance was lame and should've been utilised during the end fight.","4/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","thesar-2","20 December 2021","For the first time in nearly 20 years, I may have seen my favorite Spider-Man movie.And I'm not like a kid who loves the Ice Age movies and since part 17 is the newest one they've seen, it's their favorite. (Much like what they said about the 16 before it.) Nope. I sat from almost the first 10 minutes LOVING this movie and debating if this actually beat out the magnificent 2002's Spider-Man and its even better follow-up, 2004's Spider-Man 2.I will say this: This is my new 2nd favorite of ALL 27 MCU movies. Easy. And it's easily in the top three of the 10 theatrical-released Spider-Man movies. In fact, since part 2 in 2004, I have not been impressed with any of the Spider-Man movies until Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse and this third Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I barely liked Tom's Spider-Man: Homecoming and I refer to it Iron Man Jr because it was WAY more about Iron Man smarts and involvement and it clearly made Peter a complete moron who couldn't lift a finger or figure out anything on his own without big-daddy Tony helping. Tom's Spider-Man: Far From Home was better, but it still couldn't let go of Tony (EVEN after his character supposedly left the franchise.) This second rebooted version of Spider-Man of Tom Holland's made me sad, because of how dumb Peter is and how reliant he is on others, namely big-daddy Tony. This is NOT the brilliant Peter Parker I grew up with.But, FINALLY...they got it right with Tom's third movie. The trailer spoiled SO MUCH of this movie and the actors involved, as trailers are designed to be spoiler packed (usually the very last scene of the movie is in the trailer,) so I won't even go into the synopsis or what happens or who's in it. I just HIGHLY encourage you to see this ASAP and know: they FINALLY got Spider-Man right. After 5 disappointing follow-ups to Spider-Man 2, THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I laughed so hard, even though it wasn't like the traditional MCU movie where it's mostly a comedy. These were genuine jokes and not just inserted to please the audience who apparently wants more comedic MCU movies than action-packed Super-Hero movies. I cried a bit, even though it's mostly an uplifting movie. And yes, I marveled on how well acted and written this film is. Everybody gave it their 110% and no one stole scenes or out-performed anyone else. This was MY Endgame event.I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.I heard they're building a new trilogy with Tom Holland continuing his role as Spidey. To be frank, before this viewing, I almost didn't want to see them. If this turned out just slightly better than Tom's 2nd one which was just slightly better than his mediocre 1st one, I was pretty much done.Now, my Spidey-Sense is tingling to see what they have in store for us next.","6/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","garabedian123","17 December 2021","So for me to really love a movie i have to love everything about it and not just pieces of it. And there was basically no story here. The story of the whole movie is Spiderman asks dr strange to make the world forget him. And the rest of the movie is about the villains that show up basically just joking around having fun and trying to kill Spiderman. Reacting to the story without really adding anything to it.The rest of the movie has a lot of plot holes. A whole Lot. Like for the movie to happen Spiderman has to suddenly think he can cure mental illness. And To suddenly realize that the giant lizard man was left behind in the van. Maybe we was going to go to the 7-11 and bring back a mountain dew. Who know what they were thinking. But this scene and others like it feel so forced and does not happen naturally.The spells and how they backfire make zero sense..but we could debate that all day.I feel like the most wasted opportunity was to not bring Gwen Stacy back from the dead to reunite with Garfield Spiderman. Everyone else was dead .its not a leap to say Gwen could come back too. And of Course No James Franco...a huge wasted opportunity.Overall not the best marvel movie. But not the worst.","8/10"

They have returned thanks to the multiverse, an inter-dimensional portal accessed by the stern Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) in a spell gone awry intended to restore Spider-Man's (a winning Tom Holland) anonymity after Mysterio outed Peter Parker in Spider-Man: Far From Home.The multiverse functions as a Macguffin of sorts. It's the jumping off point for Marvel movies to do what they do best, and No Way Home doesn't disappoint, thanks to that tried and true formula of good-natured banter and giddy CGI set pieces. I liked how it taps into Electro's awesome power. I kind of imagined that Electro, played by Jamie Foxx, perhaps, and this is a big perhaps, could be a crime-fighting consultant in some future movie. And Willem Dafoe gave a tortured performance as Norman Osborn, fighting hard to silence the diabolical inner voice of Green Goblin.All Marvel pictures have non-preachy messaging.

The older Tobey Maguire works well dressed as a trendy youth counsellor. Garfield has issues regarding loneliness and he might have found some closure in this film.This might be the best Spiderman movie since the Maguire era.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","aidanratesmovies","18 December 2021","It has some minor flaws here and there- but Spider-Man No Way Home is easily the best Spider-Man film to date- successfully capturing the energy and spirit of the franchises past with an entirely new direction. One of the few things I noticed while watching this film is how intimate it was with the audience. More than ever we begin to see things from Peter's point of view, and it sculpts a very touching and emotional narrative that is easily the best execution in a Marvel property in a while. While there are some small things I think they could have touched up a bit better, this film was massively entertaining, incredibly funny, and surprisingly very emotional in the best way possible. It blends the past characters so well into its story you hardly feel it's their first time in the universe. Even more, it's such a unique experience to finally see 3 generations of superhero fans unite for such an epic opportunity- of which seems more than well done- almost too good to be true at times. It may not be perfect, but personally- I loved nearly every minute of it, and can't wait to see what this franchise continues to offer down the road.My Rating: 9.5/10.","7/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","cherold","1 April 2022","No Way Home starts with as much silliness as any Spider-Man movie in history. Peter Parker, unmasked, asks Doctor Strange to make everyone forget him, then hedges, then everything gets weird as a bunch of bad guys from previous Spider-Man movie series start wreaking havoc.The multiverse is, of course, a major component of Into the Spider-verse, but while that was brilliant and cool, here it comes across as profoundly silly.So in my head I was seeing this as the silliest of all Spider-man movies; a ludicrous romp with fun mindless action. And then, in a weird tonal shift, the movie gets really dark, and then tries to go back to the light-hearted bit with that hanging over it, and does some more really silly stuff, and some rather confused but fast-paced action, and then goes for a sad thing that I found kinda boring, and, well, what is this supposed to *be*.It doesn't make much sense, it's tonally chaotic, and as with the previous film, the action is fleetfully enjoyable but entirely forgettable.Still, a reasonable amount of the humor works, it's fun to see the way they play with the multiverse, and there's definitely fun to be had. But I find it perplexing how many people love this movie because to me it's a mess. It should have just stuck with silly all the way through.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","SAMTHEBESTEST","15 December 2021","Spider-Man : No Way Home (2021) -
Movie Review :The first trilogy of Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi, has a special place in everyone's heart. Tobey Maguire's Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers' Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014) and MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which made Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for the Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you love Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the years, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes it in style. But, he is not alone. This is Holland's first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still he is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas Present in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final product. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to forget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of time dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret by me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers' writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments whatsoever. Just one condition, you don't have to look for the logic because you're watching a Marvel/Sony's Superhero film, not Christopher Nolan's Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that intelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops the list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCU's Spider-Man No Way Home. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action, fantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but not the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of many Spidey fans but that's where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial potboiler, that's what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode at the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCU's most exhilarating entertainer post Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no matter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","cruise01","18 December 2021","5 out of 5 stars.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic, big, and one of the best Spider Man films of all time. Literally nothing is holding this film back which the script contains about everything. And director Jon Watts making the best spider man movie ever. Fans and non fans are going to love the film. The story is best to go without any spoilers. There are many surprises that will leave the crowd cheering. Story also goes into an emotional direction and making the film feeling like a conclusion to the trilogy. Characters story arcs coming to an end. While opening up more possibilities to where the direction can go.No Way Home does the third film of concluding the story right unlike Amazing Spider man movie or the original third film where they cram up so many villains and a story that can barely hold it together. No Way Home script managed to balance the story and characters out. This film does have several villains. A lot of returning villains that is a lot of fun surprises and even with a new look. Peter Parker facing each one of them and trying to stop them is awesome. The plot is great. It can try to go in a emotional direction. There is also a fun brief appearance of another character which is cool to see and hoping to see more of them in future mcu films someday.The action sequences are awesome and stylistic. Spider man fight scenes are amazing. The visual effects are brilliant. The cinematography is well done in capturing the action scenes. The music score is different by Michael Giacchino but great. The cast ensemble did a great job. Like I said earlier, the appearances making a return is a lot of fun. For a long run time, the film does feel short and very fast moving which keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The climax battle is epic and exciting. Spider Man facing multiple villains is one of the best action scenes ever. It can be a bit dark. The action scene with Spider Man and Doctor Strange chasing each other through the mirror dimension is stunning.Overall, No Way Home is one of the best Marvel films ever. And one of the best Spider man movies. It is big, epic, and the script and direction had a lot of surprises. I am hoping to see Jon Watts take on another Marvel project.There is a fun mid credit scene that hints for where the direction can go. And a post credit scene that hints of where mcu is going next.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","TheBigSick","19 December 2021","No plot at all. It's not a film. It's just a 148-minute extended easter egg for old spider-man fans.If you are Spider-man fans, go for it. Otherwise please save your money and time.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Cirdl3","15 December 2021","I can't, I can't. The whole studio was screaming from the beginning until end of the movie, this movie was so perfect, Epic, Awesome and I can't even describe it. When Andrew was there I was screaming and that was making me shaking until now. The visual, edit, it's so so so good than the other MCU movie this year except Eternals cause their visuals are looks great, like a game. I still can't believe it's look like what fans theory said and fan made I can't.I really enjoyed the movie the credit scenes and everything in this movie, and it was so prefect. When Andrew was saved MJ I was really shocked, shacking, that's was epic, and everybody was like screaming exiting applause and me too HAHAHA. After I watch Spiderman I wanted to wanna cry so bad cause it was so good. I can't stop telling you guys this movie was super good 100/10, 10/10 I really wanna watch it again. And venom part I thought he was going to help or fight the Spiderman, but he gave a venom liquid to the MCU. This movie was one of the saddest MCU movies I feel so sad when aunt may died, and everyone forget about Peter Parker. At the end Peter Parker was made a new suit and the suit it's really looked like the other Spiderman movie or the game which is super wholesome. This is so on fire!!!!!.After I've watch this 3 times and there's some scene that don't make any sense but this movie still so so so good... like when the girl from MIT open her seatbelt and when the car want to fell down, she used the seatbelt.Edit : I've been thinking about this like a month I think no way home VFX it's not that good I mean some of theme it was really look like a fan made edits.In the end Spiderman No Way Home, it such a wholesome Christmas movie and serve fantastic fans services, with great storytelling, visual, acting, and cinematography.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","diegosays","16 December 2021","This film... it's going to be the topic of every conversation for the years to come.Obviously, we all kinda expected what was going to happen in this movie.Yet, we all wanted to see it with our own eyes.And it did happen:
THREE SPIDER-MAN'S! That were brought together in the same universe after Dr. Strange erroneously cast a dangerous spell.(We needed an excuse for this to happen, of course)
My personal review here:
I'll be honest, I never was much of a fan of Holland's Spider-Man. The reason I went to see this film was because my inner child needed to see with his own eyes, the possibility of Tobey and Andrew coming back.And, yes. I cried like a baby the moment I watched the Spider-Man from my childhood meeting the Spider-Man from my adolescence.This was VERY beautiful to watch.For a second I even sobbed.But then... something was left.It felt as if the writers did not know what to do with the three ""Spider-Men"" after putting them all together.After that huge moment, that made us all scream and clap, it didn't take long till the dialogue started to feel dumb, with fan service jokes or even about their own movies as Spider-Man.Like, ""yeah, you are the second one"".The moment I saw Tobey, Andrew and Tom together, I thought:
""Oh my god, this is going to be epic af""
""This will probably be the most important film of our generation"".But, by the end of the third act, I realized:
They did it again...
They took the characters we've loved since we were kids to put them in a millionaire project with a really bad script.Repeating Raimi's mistake. They put so many villains that they didn't know what to do with them, not even with three Spider-Man's.The movie started to feel rushed after that. Causing plot holes, lack of emotions or a good dialogue between each Spider-Man and the enemy from his own universe.(Tobey Maguire sees Norman Osborn ALIVE again and he doesn't say a word to him?)
(Tobey Maguire sees Otto Octavius ALIVE again and they only exchange two words as if they had seen each other at Home Depot)
They gave us a cheapie 20 minute fight where they must ""cure"" every single villain with a magical injection? With barely any good or lasting scenes from each Spider-Man.Not to mention the horrific way Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield just ""vanished"", going back to their respective universes.The movie only lasts two hours and a half. Would it have been so difficult to add 30 more minutes of the three Spider-Man's in action?We barely saw Maguire or Garfield fighting or do anything else before that terrible goodbye.And by the way, what happened to Tobey Maguire? And I'm not talking about his age, I'm talking about how unexpressive and autistic he looks and talks in this movie.Was that scripted?My final words in this review:
Seeing the old Spider-Man's on the big screen again was something too beautiful, but it wasn't ""epic"".But it could have been.It could've been the most glorious movie we ever saw in our lives...
But, the film industry does not focus on good stories nowadays.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","MiroslavKyuranov","15 December 2021","It's...I'm still trying to realize what I've seen, but I've seen things I didn't think I'd ever see on the big screen! We all know that spoilers have been on the internet for more than a year, but apart from the things we thought, there are a lot of other things and of course I won't spoil anything, but...the film pulls very thin string from our emotions and it worked perfectly!The story is solid, it's not just fan service, which was one of my fears, there are explanations for everything. Holland grows in front our eyes with this role and this is one of the many pleasant aspects of the film. Strange's role is important (not a big shock).The villains are...I felt like a kid watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series again...I don't even know where to start. The film has more than a big stake and in some places you stand on the edge of your seat.The action scenes are the best I've ever seen in a Spidey movie and are generally among the best in comicbook movies! There are so many well-coordinated scenes, that after the movie you will want to watch them again and again.There are a lot of dialogues that hit the emotions really hard and that will be quoted long after the movie. In some places you even want the villains to prevail, because it looks so good and you want more and more and more...There are comedic moments of course, most of which well placed, but compared to the previous two films, this one is much darker and more serious. Like I said, Spidey is growing up, and that's tangible. There are a lot of surprises, some smaller, others bigger, but the movie certainly deserves more than one watch with friends. The hall was exploding! (Endgame vibes).Michael Giacchino's music, as always, is remarkable. The classic Spidey soundtrack mixed with some darker elements is a delight for the ears.Open your eyes on four, because there are a lot of references, some more tangible than others, but hardcore fans will be more than happy with what they saw.Knowing that this movie leads straight to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness...you better prepare for the unexpected!","7/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","SnoopyStyle","25 January 2022","It's immediately after the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Spider-Man (Tom Holland) had been framed by Mysterio who also revealed his true identity, Peter Parker. He and his friends, MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon), are hounded by the media, demonized by many, and investigated by the authorities. Frustrated with his situation, he asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to do a spell.This Spider group is a fun group. I love this young group and then there are the veterans. It's a great way to reincorporate the previous Spider-verses and the bonus is getting all these great veteran actors. They are all great at delivering complex characters. There is a bit of redemption for some who ended the previous versions on a down note. This is a good movie by itself as well as a good progression for the MCU.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","sharky_55","23 December 2021","Tobey Maguire's trilogy remains indelible, from its origin story, the pitch-perfect sequel, and the messy conclusion. It has Raimi written all over it, and even at its worst moments, the least you could dub it is memorable. The follow-up series doesn't have that same appeal, but Garfield's charisma shines through, as it similarly does here. Conversely, Holland's rendition has always felt a little cut-and-paste from its surrounding universe, unable to separate itself from the whimsy and bathos of the MCU. This Peter Parker's one-liners are drawn from the same snarky persona as Iron Man, Star-Lord, War Machine, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man...the list goes on. I've made my peace with it. It isn't a new criticism, and could be levelled at most films post-Phase One. But it's always felt limiting in terms of crafting distinct character (and filmic) voices and undermining attempts at sentimentality. Let's start with Cumberbatch's Strange. He's stepping into the mentor role post-Endgame but he's never been given a meaningful opportunity to develop his own philosophy on the character, let alone a voice. Sans his solo film, the premise of the Sorcerer Supreme makes him a convenient plot device to facilitate the adventures of other superheroes. Listen to his dialogue here; it's always delivered at a distance, drenched in cynicism, as if it's afraid of fully buying into the idea of a connection. Cumberbatch seems to be constantly setting up the next punchline, and so even if this abrasive back-and-forth elicits laughs, it never builds to anything genuine, rendering the climatic callback (obvious from a mile away) into a deflated attempt at growth and recognition. Yes, RDJ addressed Holland in the same way, but there was history and a relationship there. There's an inherent self-consciousness to the way that Feige and co. Craft the MCU's humour, so relentlessly wary of losing the audience for more than a second that they keep sincerity at an arm's length. Observe how the entire film just grinds to a halt for the Spidey's stand-up routine atop the Statue of Liberty scaffolding; the trialogue isn't written for the characters, it's written for the fans to play spot the reference (""You're amazing. I want to hear you say it.""). Marvel would never in a million years allow their Spider-Man to be the butt of the joke, or freeze-frame on his goofy smile over 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'. He's too cool for that.This universe's Peter Parker and his defining Spider-Man moment is how he reacts to losing his Uncle Ben, but the crux of its emotional impact rests on what has already been established. What do we really know about this version of Aunt May, anyway? No, not what we surmise and assume based on the previous actions of the mentor archetype, but her as an actual person. How much screentime has Tomei been afforded here and in the first two films that isn't delegated to punchlines about her hotness or her apparent fling with Happy? You need to earn the right to drop that iconic line about responsibility; the words don't hold any weight in and of themselves. What does follow her death works in pushing Peter into newer and darker territory for this Spider-Man, and Holland is finally asked to consider the interiority of his character and how these circumstances might actually damage the psyche of a teenager. After all, what was the complication of Far From Home beyond mopping up the external mess of an Avengers-level threat? Here, Peter must contend with the consequences of his actions (the film initially made me balk at the idea of resetting the universe just so a few teens could get accepted into their college of choice, and then cleverly flips that on its head) and ultimately assume the burden and emotional baggage that comes with being a superhero. The rooftop scene where Maguire and Garfield confess of their own failures and futile quests for vengeance is unlike anything even the MCU is capable of; it's not merely a crossover, but a character speaking across generations to itself, pleading for this Peter to avoid repeating their past mistakes. It leans pretty hard on the audience having that pre-knowledge; you need to know the stories they refer to in order to buy into the emotion, but for those who do, it's genuinely affecting.So Peter completes his mission and manages to do justice to Aunt May's final wish, but what of the 'villains'? The other core theme of the film, beyond Peter's grappling with his grief and the value of revenge, is the idea of second chances being afforded to those who deserve them (who, in Aunt May's world, is everyone). Yet how much of this actually rings true for each member of the Spidey rogues gallery dragged in from the multiverse? Norman and Otto are afforded the most agency as a result of their characters' redemption being more or less pre-ordained. They don't need 'fixing', just a removal of that corruptive influence and a reversion to their original selves. But what of the others? Electro is stripped of his powers and therefore his bloodlust, makes a brief quip referencing Miles Morales, and then is returned to live life as his pre-superpowered, nerdy outcast self. What lesson does he learn? Sandman, as one of the relatively more sympathetic villains of the Spideyverse, was already redeemed at the end of his chapter and never even died at the hands of Spider-Man, so his appearance here is puzzling, reduced once more to an angry CGI spectacle that hits things (Thomas Haden Church receives all of 20 seconds of screentime, with the rest of his stay in sand form). Peter may take responsibility for mistakes made and change himself for good, but how much of this change transfers over to those he impacted? It's a little too neat of a thematic bow to tie all these different arcs together in the name of redemption. The action itself is fine, inoffensive; the climactic battle starts off poorly for the Spideys, before Holland gives a pep talk about teamwork and they then execute a series of pre-planned, carefully choreographed moves in front of a blue screen, only this time it works! There's nothing actually revealed about leadership or teamwork here, but we don't care; we just want that master shot of their superhero landings. It's screensaver material.Legacy is key here: that of this live-action universe across three generations of the webslinger, of the characters within their worlds, and of the films themselves. It's now nigh impossible to engage with this franchise without consuming each and every chapter of its storytelling, an increasingly mammoth task that grows with each phase, miniseries, and cinematic event. You can't just view them as one-offs; you need to buy in and subscribe and devote time to tracking and keeping tabs on its chronology. Your reward is the payoff for this dedication; you know that character, you know the event that they are referencing when it comes up on the big screen. Garfield's Peter is forced to relive the same moment that led to Gwen's death during his rescue of MJ, and fans can recognise the trauma it induces and how significant and moving it is for him to be able to save her this time round. Other fans, however, from the looks of internet reaction videos, seem to be cheering in recognition of this. Is that not emblematic of the two camps of MCU takes in conflict with each other? I'm unsure whether they can or should be conflated. In 2012, when the MCU was still in its infancy, Ebert wrote this of The Avengers: ""It provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable."" I think we do deserve these films. We've supported the franchise from its early rocky beginnings, and we've been there every step of the way in its evolution into a cultural giant. I experienced my own payoff, as millions around the world did, seeing Avengers Endgame almost a decade later as each character stepped out of their portals, the goosebumps on my arm as close to something quantifiable for that feeling of awe and yes, recognition. What lies in future for this franchise, and what is (if there are any plans for, commercial or otherwise) its endgame? I didn't feel anything of that calibre watching No Way Home, but I think it still sticks its landing. Having sacrificed his own relationships to fix the mess that emerged from his faults, Holland returns to where I think Peter Parker truly belongs: in a run-down apartment, landlord berating him for the rent, once again alone with only his suit for company. But there's a reason why the most important scenes are always shot with the mask off. This is where the core and heart of the character resides, and what Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Verse understood so well: the power was never a choice, but accepting the responsibility that comes with it is. Holland's Peter finally makes that choice, and in doing so unveils the human behind the mythos of the superhero. No nanotech or Instant-Kill Mode could ever make up for that.","9/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","drawlife","16 December 2021","Where to begin? I would find it extremely difficult for any Spider-Man fan to dislike this film. What's amazing is the feat that Jon Watts, Kevin Feige, Amy Pascal and others accomplished here.Let me just say the the plot has a lot of mumbo jumbo, comic-book logic that typically most comic fans can get on board with including myself, but because the MCU has built enough trust with everyone, you just kinda go with it. Even if you don't, the magic of all these actors and legacy characters returning for this dazzling spectacle will kinda make you forgive it.Lets also just get this out of the way. It was the worst kept secret that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were appearing alongside Tom Holland. The consensus on this was pretty much acknowledged to almost every fanboy, fangirl and most casual fans too. Also the return of Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, Thomas Haden Church's Sandman and Rhys Ifans' Lizard made it more apparent. It's just a marvel(pun intended) that Sony and Marvel/Disney were able to bring everyone back. Never would I have thought it was possible.The villains are a lot more poignant and prominent than I thought they would be. Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe are THE MVPs of the bunch. Dafoe is used to great effect and is as menacing as I remember him and Molina commands the screen with his presence and delivery. They still feel very much in tune with what Sam Raimi did. Jamie Foxx has a second chance with Electro and it works a lot more now than it did since the last time we saw him in 2014. Unfortunately Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans are the benchwarmers of the villains. BUT, used to some capacity where they don't feel totally left out.Now lets talk about the Spider-Men.TOM HOLLAND: I think Marvel Studios and Sony either had this planned all along or they heard the fans and listened. What I loved about Holland/MCU's iteration is that he is kid who brings his exciting energy and youthful enthusiasm to the Avengers. Also as fan of Spidey comics, particularly the Ultimate Spider-Man series, I feel most of the best stories is when he's a teenager in high school. So I got what I wanted in that regard, however my criticism of his portrayal is that he was basically Iron Man Jr. With a lot of Stark tech. But here, they strip him down, beat him to a pulp, he loses his Aunt May, makes sacrifices and learns from his mistakes. He finally learns and understands with the help of Tobey and Andrew providing their wisdom. I think finally we are going to get the Spider-Man that we hoped he would grow into. It is Holland's best performance as the character by far.ANDREW GARFIELD: Jon Watts and his writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers redeem him. Not that his portrayal was bad, because personally I always found Garfield's Spider-Man the most accurate of the bunch and there are some things to like about the Marc Webb films. Garfield gets the closure he needed as his movies ended abruptly after the 2014 sequel. Every moment he has where he shares his experience with Holland and Maguire on screen is a major highlight. Especially when he talks about Gwen Stacy. He also has a nice moment where he saves Zendaya's MJ, mirroring the fact that he never got to save Gwen. Garfield absolutely crushed it and displayed his amazing acting chops.TOBEY MAGUIRE: For many, including myself Tobey Maguire is the OG. Growing up with his Spider-Man films, words can't really describe the emotions I felt seeing him back. I was practically reliving my childhood the minute he appeared. It was all coming back to me, being on the hype train during his era of films and just obsessing over the Sam Raimi films, it just brought me back. I truly felt like a kid again. Tobey's presence in the film feels very much like the older brother of the group and he bounces off Holland and Garfield seamlessly. It's been a hot minute seeing Tobey on the big screen since PAWN SACRIFICE(good movie by the way) and he hasn't lost a step.Once Garfield and Maguire appear, all three share the limelight as co-leads and not a single one of them feel left out.As for the rest of the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch always commands your attention. I was initially turned off of the idea of having Holland's Spidey have another mentor like figure, but here Strange and Spidey are at odds on how to handle their problem after the botched spell. So that was a nice surprise in the marketing and in the film. Marisa Tomei has way more to do in this film than the previous films and has an emotional send off with her death. Zendaya's MJ has grown on me since FAR FROM HOME and Jacob Batalon's Ned is less annoying here which I appreciated.Piggy backing off that, I did admire that Watts aimed for a more mature tone throughout the film. As I get older I do crave that serious tone a bit more and I savor it every time it is present. I mean yes the standard formulaic humor is still present, but I appreciated every moment where things got serious.I love the MCU and I'm always there to watch their product, but I can be honest and say that at times, they are like comfort food. I know what I'm getting and I know I'll enjoy it. I also haven't been shy of the films I've really disliked, but they have been consistent as a whole. However, when they either take big swings or assemble(pun intended) a film with a more mature tone, every so often we'll get absolute gems like the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy, the first AVENGERS, the first GUARDIANS, and INFINITY WAR. I'm extremely pleased that SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME belongs with those gems. Should Sony and Marvel/Disney keep working together I look forward to more adventures as the Spider-Man I wanted Tom Holland to be. I would also be lying to you if I didn't crave more of Garfield and Maguire. Anything is possible nowadays as we even got a Charlie Cox's Daredevil cameo, which was also heavily speculated and if you've been keeping up with HAWKEYE, you know we're in for a treat.While the story can be cluttered, the film drives it home with the development of Holland's Spider-Man, some excellent performances, and fan service with a purpose. Definitely the best MCU Spider-Man film, one of my favorite MCU entries as a whole, and in the conversation of one of the best Spidey films with Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2 and INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE.9.5/10.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Thanos_Alfie","17 December 2021","""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is an Action - Fantasy movie and the third movie of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise, in which we follow the story of Spider-Man after ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"". Everybody knows the true identity of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange can help Peter with a spell. Everything change when this spell goes wrong.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an amazing plot, contained plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. Regarding the plot, there were some plot twists that I did not expect so, it was a nice surprise and something that made the movie even more interesting and enjoyable. The direction which was made by Jon Watts was very good and he used wisely both information and characters to create this special movie. The interpretations of Tom Holland who played as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Alfred Molina who played as Dr. Otto Octavius / Doc Ock, Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Doctor Strange and Willem Dafoe who played as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin were simply fantastic and their combination worked very well and created an outstanding result. All in all, I have to say that ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is one of the best Marvel movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","namob-43673","15 December 2021","Updated with spoilers:
This is the spider-man movie to see. This is the love child of the entire MCU. The action is fantastic, everything is great, and there is so many brilliant callbacks and wonderful nostalgia mixed with love, emotions and great acting. For the first 40min or so this is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with Daredevil cameo as the top of the line - and I loved this move, however it has a few errors that lower the score and the longer the movie goes the less I enjoyed it which is kinda strange since the ending is spectacular and Amazing.The CGI is not always on point. Those computer graphic misses stod out was because it is excellent otherwise, so kinda weird with a few misses. I think the Sandman was badly done and The Lizard was a joke. I also seriously dislike Peter decision to try to save everyone and the fight with Strange. That is where the movie almost lost me. And these are clearly evil people, and they died in their respective universe. But okay, the plot does need to happen... The worst thing though is why them? In all the universes, of all the people that know who Peter is, these are the ones coming through? Why not 97 of Uncle Ben's? That would make more sense. My final complaint is that all that comes before comes to Peter is now erased, which is fine and a great hero sacrifice, but it also create issues with continuity and storylines.The great awesomeness is all the rest. The music score is amazing, best since Captain Marvel (which, no matter what you thought of that movie, has the best original score of any superhero movie). And the Flashpoint? Haha.. great stuff. The action is spectacular, the script amazing, all the actors do an fantastic job with Willem Dafoe probably stealing the acting crown. Two end-credit scenes, although I heard some saw a long ""trailer"", which I did not see so felt that was kinda weird, perhaps only in some theatres? The first meh, kinda cool I guess. The second about something I care nothing about with a character I care absolutely nothing about so kinda disappointing to me. I am not going to see Dr Strange II, I really dislike Wanda and I dislike Elizabeth Olsen portrait of her even less. That TV show was the worst I have ever seen, except for Batwoman.. nothing is worse than Batwoman... That Strange movie will suck.Despite my criticism this movie is together with the current running Hawkeye show (which is fantastic) I feel like the MCU is still alive and kicking. And with Daredevil and Kingpin now part of the MCU, can be worse for sure. This movie really take hold of you and give you that magic which the best superhero movies do. I would rank this as the second best Spider-Man movie and top 10 for sure within the MCU. 8/10 and I highly recommend.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Leofwine_draca","16 July 2022","I'm no fan of the SPIDER-MAN films with Tom Holland; I find them way too kiddified and the humour just jars with me. But I can comfortably say that this is the best of the trilogy, and that's because it feels fresher and different to the rest. I loved the recall of old villains, it was great to see Foxx, Molina and Dafoe come back again and it's clear they're having fun. Cumberbatch is good in a limited role too. Best of all are Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who light up the screen and make all of their scenes delightful; they show up Holland, that's for sure. The rest is your usual mish mash of CGI action complete with an excruciatingly overblown and sentimental ending (please!).","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","El-Ak","15 December 2021","I just watched the movie at the theatre and you really don't wanna miss this one out. I will make it simple, the movie will live to your expectations If not exceed them, however, during the first half of the film you won't witness anything new. Every fight scene is in the trailer and I LITREALLY mean every fight scene. But don't get me wrong they were awesome and of course not the whole fight scenes. It's also full of talking and a bit more funny lines than usual. You also have a very very silly plot that was based on some character's opinion and lead to all the events of the film and then comes on of the best plots and entrances near the beginning of the second half that you will ever witness and here comes the second half of the movie and trust me it was beyond awesome. The VFX of this film is breathtaking. Every action sequence is very complicated and loaded with tons of details. The visuals are insaaane. You also have a couple of Spidy suits and most importantly you won't be disappointed with anything you might be expecting. You have Dr. Strange and believe me it was one of the best times you will see him along with another hero cause Benedict is such a great actor. Zendaya role however was meaningless but you know she is Spidy's GF. The Finale of the film is beyond great and feels like a dream come true for all fans around the world that will leave you full of emotions, amazed and shocked! Even the two post credit scenes made everyone yell in the theatre (who yelled for more than half of the movie). Not a perfect movie and a lot of things may not make sense and will make your brain full of questions like Endgame and that's what make a movie a great one. I have now experienced the whole trilogy at the theatre and there is no doubt that this one is the best. I hope you just relax and enjoy it cause as a fan I'd give it a 10/10 easily but a solid 9/10 with love and joy is fair enough.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","lakings97","29 December 2021","Spider-man: No Way Home continues where Far From Home had ended when Spider-man's identity is revealed. In order to reverse his publicity as Peter Park, he enlists the help of Dr. Strange played Benedict Cumberbatch. The spell doesn't work exactly as planned and opens a window into alternative universes that collide all the villains and Spider-Man's together much like Spider-man Into the Spider-verse. William Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church revise their mischievous ways but Holland's version of our friendly neighborhood spider-man uses Stark's technology to help each one from being killed from their own universes. Tom, Zendaya and Jacob bring together the other Spider-man reprised by Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. Marisa Tomei added a level of support, love and emotion to the point that we all cherish. The story showed a unique perspective of Spider-man that we haven't seen in any of the other films. I loved this one, one of my favorite Marvel movies ever, it was filled with empathy, adventure, pure emotional ride. I could watch this one over and over again. Add this one to your library.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","pughspencer","11 August 2022","Not only is this one of the best MCU films, its debatably the best Spider-Man film. It no doubt feels like a love letter to how far the Spider-Man films have come. This film wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for many things like the MCU setting up their own Spidey and Doctor Strange as well as everything that happened in all the previous Spider-Man films. It's fan service but the fan service has purpose to be there. But underneath all the fun callbacks it's still a damn good Spider-Man story. Tom Holland to me is the best live action Spider-Man we've had so far and he's come such a long way. From taking orders from Tony Stark in Civil War to now giving the orders to two other Spider-Men really is an achievement for him. The movie even fixes things many have had problems with. Not just for him but for other things too like how much of William Dafoe's performance as the Green Goblin we missed when he had to wear that helmet in the first Raimi Spider-Man movie. There's so many incredible moments in this movie id never thought id see one day. From Spider-Man defeating Doctor Strange with math to Aunt May's tragic death to watching all three Spider-Men swing together and do science was such a treat. It has almost everything I could want in a Spider-Man flick.The only negative I have for the film is the mid credit scene with Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom. I'm not a fan of those films as I don't like the direction they took this Eddie Brock and Venom. Having him jump to the MCU & than jump back to his own universe was just a waste of time & this whole Marvel Studios having to share the rights with Sony thing is just getting so obnoxious. I really hope they get the full rights back from Sony so these dumb villian spinoff movies can die before it gets even worse.Still it didn't ruin my experience with this highly entertaining flick. It's one of those movies I can watch for hours and never get boredüñ§","7/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","iamianiman","15 December 2021","NO SPOILERS!Everything that has been previously built has led up to this and tens to hundreds of theories have been speculated and lo and behold, this is so much better than Endgame. Though most of the theories aren't true, but it's impressive to witness the fact that it lives up to all the hype. Sheer madness!Without spoiling anything, No Way Home opens umpteenth of possibilities for new plots and world-building in that the next Spiderman trilogy or Marvel films, anything and everything can happen or exist beyond a shadow of a doubt.Mystical and mysterious, this most anticipated film of the year provides a plot that is rarely seen in the superhero cinematic landscape. It's exciting, refreshing and breaking new grounds insofar that it's unpredictable as it keeps on searching for new angles to entice both the old and new generations.People may get disconnected with the plot because it involves time and magic. However, what's so great about No Way Home is in the friendly tone and weight that they present to the audience, making it easy to understand even coming from someone who is not a huge fan of superhero films.Tom Holland powerfully brings everything here to the table. His range of acting and emotional skills has improved tremendously since the predecessor. Even for someone who despises him, you'll be knocking yourself off your feet in no time!Compared to other origin films that opts for typical storytelling, No Way Home attempts to balance humor, drama and action all in one movie and oh my, how it succeeds at that is just one huge jaw-dropping spectacle.As revealed in the trailer, there are plenty of villains await and everyone has a screentime just or almost as much as the others. No one is in the spotlight too little or too much, resulting in an appropriate amount of sheer greatness to introduce back all the bad guys.There are a lot of jokes to spot in this film. However, some of them offer subtlety and puns that you can see it coming only by the help of your own experience and intelligence. Only when you see the film, you'll understand what I'm saying.Never have I seen such a beautiful but haunting ending before. I don't wanna say much here but the ending alone is a masterpiece that it feels like it's coming from an Oscar-worthy film and I'm not exaggerating even one bit.The one thing I dislike here with No Way Home is its cheesiness during the first half. It projects this parody-like vibe that somehow takes us out of the experience a little bit. Even I get a tingling sense that the cameras are just too lazy to shoot the movie.The 2 post-credits scenes are good and exciting but I feel like it doesn't live the hype to all the existing theories on the web. Good but nothing shocking.Verdict: Within 150 minutes, Spiderman No Way Home offers a rollercoaster ride of a thousand of emotions, similar to Infinity War & Endgame and it is definitely the best Marvel origin stand-alone film to date.","8/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","eddie_baggins","16 December 2021","THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW!There's not much chance of devoted Spidey/Marvel fans walking away from Jon Watt's and Tom Holland's latest web-slinging adventure without a strong sense of satisfaction from an epic outing, that in many ways feels as grand and risky as when the world first wondered how Marvel would manage to bring The Avengers to life all the way back in 2012.The third trip between director Watt's and his leading man, that sees the groundwork laid before it combine here in a loaded and fan servicing collaboration, to talk about No Way Home without giving away its many narrative treasures and likely iconic pop culture moments is a difficult task but there's reason to believe even early on in its release that this Spider-Man outing will go down as one of, if not the best big screen solo outings for the local neighborhood vigilante yet.As is always the case with such loaded Marvel outings, there are a few narrative conveniences that don't hold up to much examination and a few half-explored ideas but too dwell on these moments would be a waste of ones time when there's so much joy, fun and even unexcepted emotion to be found in Watt's film as Parker and his offsiders find themselves battling a severe multiverse problem that threatens to derail the world as we know it.Filled with an abundance of action set pieces, well-known Marvel comedic beats, more throwbacks and nods to lore than almost any other Marvel film before it and fun character interactions, what is perhaps most surprising of all about this high reaching adventure is the wealth of strong performances found within it from one of the most stacked casts the long running superhero brand has seen yet.From the expected and unexpected cast additions, everyone here brings their A-game with Holland and Zendaya as the loving couple getting great moments together and feeling well and truly like they've both become their respective characters in body and soul, while other returning cast members from both recent and less recent times all appear to care more than just a paycheck collection would suggest giving No Way Home a strong sense of purpose and heart, with the small moments making more of an impact than the films various action oriented segments.Likely to be a film that is explored multiple times and one that is sure to provide hidden moments of joy and satisfaction to those that delve back into it across the ensuing years, No Way Home is another groundbreaking achievement from Marvel who could've easily sat back and enjoyed their success after the events of Endgame but have continued to push the boundaries of blockbuster movie making as they keep looking to provide us with top notch entertainment that is undeniable and unmatched in quality.Final Say -There's no doubt about the fact that Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest and arguably best Spider-Man outing yet. A stunning achievement in pushing forward while also acknowledging the past, things here might not be perfect but there's too much to like here to deny that Marvel has once more raised the bar for the comic book cinematic landscape.4 imprisoned trees out of 5Check out my film blog Jordan and Eddie for more reviews!","7/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","gianmarcoronconi","16 December 2021","This film releases unique emotions and also a disproportionate number of scenes of applause and tears. The film is very moving and exciting and the characters are all there so you can't tell them anything. The plot based on healing the baddies and not defeating them is quite original even if it has a meaningless beginning. For the rest this negative film has that the dialogues are disgusting for most of the film and the villains are not managed so well, but it is overcome because in the end the film lives up to expectations and with an exaggeration of fan service.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","cthirlby","15 December 2021","Wow what a ride and such an experience. As a big Spider-Man fan I got a surprising few things from this movie too. First of all they stuck with the villains stories no matter the reception they got on the previous films they stuck with it and that's honestly so respectful. To see not all of them actually be villains because Peter is trying to help them from themselves by not dying was the Spider-Man I have been hoping to see from Tom Holland which I didn't feel in the other movies. Green Goblin is easily the most terrifying how he pretends to be on Peters side and tries to manipulate Peter and May. Lizard wasn't in it much but hey he was still good in the movie. Sandman was awesome, he protected Peter from Electro after the events of Spider-Man 3 and just wanted to be with his daughter. Electro was fun and fresh too with his new look and the visuals. Doc Ock obviously amazing and to hear the call backs to Spider-Man 2, so happy they didn't make him a villain and he actually helped them. Second of all Aunt May being Peters ""Uncle Ben"" was amazing, she delivered the line perfectly and she was just great especially since we had more screen time with her in these movies than we did with Ben in the others. Thirdly Matt Murdock! Are you kidding me! A very small part but wow it's good to see him again looking great and I can't wait to see what they do with that character. Fourthly Andrew and Tobey of course... Andrew coming through that portal and being not quite sure if it was him until he came forward was unreal everyone went mad in the cinema (Same with Tobey) he is still great after years, Tobey amazing too they just hold a special place in a lot of peoples hearts and their interactions with the characters especially Peter (Toms) Just very impactful and maybe they will come back who knows. 5th point is that in the portal coming through we saw Kraven and a Rhino variant and I wanted them to come but who knows... overall they ended the film great with the villains not having to die. Final points I'll say is that Green Goblin vs Peter was pretty brutal, it was intense and Tobey stopping Peter from killing him was just so perfect. My last final point is that ending... Peter having to leave everything behind to keep them safe was the Spider-Man we all know and love. Him getting an apartment struggling to get by and being Spider-Man still with a comic accurate suit and not an iron spider suit. This is the Spider-Man I have wanted and I can't wait to see what they will do. The ending made me think of the game for the PS4/5 and if they go down that route of tone and stuff then this could be some of the best Spider-Man movies coming up. No gadgets, just Spider-Man and Peter Parker being their natural selves and the heroes we all love. Overall this film is something else and I'm glad I was there to see it, it's a good laugh, it's a good thrill and it's Spider-Man. Thank you to everyone who made this film!","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","olliechowes","19 December 2021","The anticipation for the movie was second to only Avengers: Endgame. So naturally I was expecting big things, and trust me, it didn't disappoint.I found myself, throughout the film and the days after watching it, trying and failing to pin my thoughts down and give it a score out of 10. This is likely due to the amalgamation of so many previous characters, spanning from 2002-2021 through multiple movies and franchises. This was not a negative, but rather something to be very, very excited about and nervous of how it would be handled. I was scared of a clear villain not being established, however Willem Defoe's Green Goblin was expertly presented as 'the baddie'. Peter is haunted by him after the death of Aunt May, and his iconic, almost Joker-esque laugh gave him a real villainous tone.I can't write a spoilers review without talking about the other Spider-men. The relationship between the three Peter's is everything every Spider-man fan has ever wanted, from their hilarious conversations about web shooters and aliens to their instant connection over the loss of their loved ones. I could not help but laugh at the simplicity yet complication of it all, it's just three different Peter's, yet 20 years in the making. A side note, does this mean that the MCU started in 2002?The basic plot for this film is something new for Spider-man. And while it works very well, it did keep me asking questions about Doctor Strange's abilities. Could he have made everyone forget about the clip that Mysterio made instead of listening to Peter's suggestion? Surely he's smart enough to know that Peter wouldn't want everyone to forget? This line of logic is the main fault with this film. Specifically towards the end when every universe is about to raid Peter's and he suggests to just recast the original spell. Films in which the main character suddenly comes up with some form of solution at the end undermines the entire movie.Tom Holland takes the role of Spider-man in a different way than Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire did. Throughout his first trilogy, he doesn't ""change"" into Spider-man, he essentially stays as Peter even when he's in the suit. This helped bring Peter alive and give us a much more realistic representation of the character. He also doesn't have as much of a problem of balancing lives like Maguire did, or a problem with his Uncle Ben for that matter (Who isn't even mentioned by Holland's Parker after Maguire's Parker explains how he lost him). His adorable geekiness and lovable lightheartedness make this film not only a brilliant Spider-man movie, but a brilliant Peter Parker movie too.","7/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","itisallgoodman","6 March 2022","After the third phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe, the franchise dropped the quality and I don't remember seeing an impressive movie since Phase 4 so far. Spider-Man No Way home became the biggest hype of the year 2021. In the end and I was personally expecting a dissapointment due to the weak performance of MCU in the last time, but No Way Home did way more than I expected. The movie full of nostalgic and emotional scenes. The movie that connects all the generations together and makes a perfect ending to all the three Spider-Man franchises. In the end, this is an another masterpiece from Marvel, with the best fighting scenes I've ever seen in my life, with the best Picture, the best CGI and the best acting so far. I loved The Spider-Men relationships and I have to say that all the three legendary actors (Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield) did a perfect job portraying their Spider-Men.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","sbweightman","18 December 2021","A good all round superhero action film with great special effects and cast of characters. The way it brings together the multiverse does allow for some entertaining surprises, but the lack of a new or single villain as well as the seeming invulnerability of the hero does negatively impact the tension.

I especially like the parts where 3 spidermans comes together as a team, Tobey and Andrew becoming the big brothers and providing the much needed guidance to Tom. Tobey even acting as the senior most and guiding Andrew through relationships and the best part Tobey putting himself between Tom and goblin to prevent Tom from running into the path of vengeance. I've seen the movie twice in 12 hours but couldn't shake the emotions I felt for the three of them the first time.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","garethvk","15 December 2021","Life for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is complicated thanks to his dual life as Spider-Man and the challenges of being in High School. Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"".Taking place where ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.As if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.Desperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.Strange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).Strange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.As more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.What follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.The film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.The film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.While there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.There is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jettnnj","17 April 2022","In the first half of the movie I couldn't even find the conflict. It has the look and feel of a sitcom. The actors are constantly winking at the audience like some tired vaudeville act. The acting was atrocious. The story atrocious. More mixed up morality. I'm not the only one. I've spoken to several friends that turned it off after five minutes.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","PedroPires90","15 December 2021","NO SPOILERS - The first act is a mess saved by some familiar faces and one or two funny scenes. However, with the first emotional event of the film, everything changes. First, with a lot of fan service and some weird changes on the tone (I still don't get how MCU wants everybody to move from crying a lot to laughing hard in the next minute), but always growing to a very strong third act on an epic battle (even if slightly confusing).There are problems. The fan service - already mentioned - is simply too much. It's not only what you are thinking. It's remembering all the single moments you can imagine, it's in a lot of dialogue, lots of lines and mostly is there only to tell you ""hey, I'm here, remember?"". But what works mainly as a gimmick supports a very good emotional arc, which happens for the first time on this trilogy. This also helps Holland and Zendaya, who are now better actors and have time to show what they can bring to the table.It's not a perfect film. It's still behind the first two of Maguire but I hope they can keep on this way.PS: The humour is still an issue, but a bit less than on the previous ones.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","safrch","9 May 2022","We need more soul and feel in the stories , only having special effects does not make it more worthy.Definitely overrated! We really miss the original spider man who was so common yet so special. Being spider man was so special! In this movie, With so many superheroes sometimes it is hard to ascertain whether you are watching Avengers, Doctor strange , Spiderman or some other marvel movies. Spider man is just another person.The original spider man was so special, he had a sweet grandmother, a girl friend, he went to college , he liked milk and cake , he celebrated Christmas, yet he could cast a web.In this movie he simply is not so common anymore, by giving him too many powers , you disconnect him from humans and associate him with something else.We don't feel that that the guy we meet down the street could be that anonymous spiderman.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mtmetcalfe","22 December 2021","The action is great. It was fun seeing all the villains. Defoe is excellent. There was also some really heartfelt dramatic moments. I did like the ending. But...
PROBLEM 1:The whole genesis of the problems that Peter Parker faces is a complete betrayal of Dr. Stranges character. There is no way in hell he would gamble with the fate of the universe to cast this spell for Peter. Know matter how bad he wants things to be better for Peter.PROBLEM 2: Now all of a sudden we can cure evil in our villains?! I found this to be ridiculous. Complete incompetence of Peter to just not hit the button and send these villains back to their universe. Way too much of a gamble to just keep all the villains around while he creates some drugs to cure mental illness.","6/10"

It was amazing to see all the villains from the previous movies return and the chemistry between Toby, Andrew and Tom was not only hilarious but genuine and fantastic. They really listened to the fans on the one. Toby and Andrew have much bigger parts than I expected which made this movie for me. When they showed up in the movie the cinema absolutely erupted. It was a very special moment - one guy in my row was crying. Not to mention Dr Strange is not only brilliant in this movie but also has a huge part himself. This is quite possibly the best Marvel to date.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","DeBBss","13 March 2022","Spider-Man: No Way Home had the potential to be great, but everything didn't really mesh together as it should've. Tobey and Maguire's Spider-Mans didn't really feel like the same versions from all those years ago, or at least that's what I feel. And the villains were all meh except for Doc Oc and Green Goblin, but even these villains weren't as great as they were before. Everything feels watered down in my opinion, and the stakes were just not high enough for me to take enough interest.There are some nice nostalgia scenes and good action pieces, but that's pretty much it. The acting feels cheesy most of the time and there's way too much crying, some people may not mind the amount of crying, but they are really trying to exaggerate the emotions.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a decent movie, 5/10 - 6/10; nowhere near an 8.5. It had the concept but not the execution. It all seems more like nostalgia-bait more than anything. It is worth a watch at the end of the day, so I'd give it a recommendation to all the Spider-Man fans.","3/10"

Just from the initial phase of Tom distracting Dr Strange during one of his spells, 5x, ugh. It's annoying. The action is sub par and the dialogue is fit for teenagers.Then stretch it out to 2.5 hours as Dafoe has to get his acting scenes in and be the lead villian.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kuner-59029","16 December 2021","After the animated Spider-Man - Into the Spider-Verse, it was an incredibly smart business move by Sony to attempt something similar with their new Spider-Man movie. And considering the mammoth task of juggling so many characters, the overall storyline isn't bad. This could have easily been a far less focused movie tripping all over itself. However, No Way Home trips over something, that isn't its own fault:
The Tom Holland Spider-Man films and universe are just not very interesting. Tom Holland is an okay actor, but his tenure has suffered by having been shoehorned into the other Marvel films, never having had an origin story or even much in terms of character development or motivation.Does anyone remember how his story even began? Everyone remembers Tobey Maguire's Spidey origin. You kind of remember Andrew Garfield's, even if it was almost the exact same story, just less interesting.Tom Holland is a bit of blank state. He does his wide eyed stare and overexcited fast talking thing, but is given very little to work with. Most of the Marvel movies had him on as comic relief, playing second or third fiddle to their mainstay characters.His own movies likewise got bogged down in ""bathos"" humor, constantly winking at the audience and having characters break character for Family Guy style self-referential humor or ""what is happening?"" moments. They were largely plot driven films instead of character driven like the Sam Raimi films.Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield command the screen whenever they appear in this movie. They slip back into their roles like it was yesterday, and it truly makes me hope that Sony will be brave enough to continue their stories in their respective iterations and universes. Andrew Garfield's films suffered from poor script writing, lame villains and a botched attempt at starting a cinematic universe, but he is extremely charismatic and fun to watch. He almost steals the show here.Willem Dafoe and especially Alfred Molina are fantastic here as well, while Electro and Lizard are unnecessary in an already overpopulated roster. I'm glad they didn't throw Venom in as well (surely they were tempted to).One of the major problems here is that the villains have no relationship to Holland's protagonist, and they have little to no motivation to fight someone they never met. The script demands it though, since these Marvel movies need an action scene ever 20 minutes.The parts where characters are talking are actually a lot more interesting than the fighting scenes, which just grind the narrative to a halt to throw a bunch of noisy CGI crap at the screen. This is especially frustrating at the end, where a giant brawl breaks out for no reason whatsoever right in the middle of the heroes and villains actually negotiating.Zendaya and the comic relief kid are charisma vacuums, with Zendaya failing to act as any kind of emotional anchor to the plot, and the other guy failing to be funny. When they share the screen with the characters from the previous series, it becomes painfully obvious how outclassed they are. Maguire and Dunst shared real on screen chemistry, as did Garfield and Stone.In the end, the best this film has to offer is nostalgia and *hopefully* a path to resurrect the previous Spider-Man film series as Sony does their own thing, separate from the MCU. The MCU is pretty much grasping at straws at this point and burned out much of its audience with six subpar films (Eternals, Shang Chi, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Far from Home and even Endgame, which was a major step down from Infinity War) and who knows how much terrible filler stuff on TV.Sony would do well to pick up where they left off. A 4th Raimi Spiderman with Maguire would be a box office hit.","7/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","dhruvrajraulji","5 April 2022","Ohh man, what a ride. This movie is a dream come true for me. So Spider-man: No Way Home, before I write this let me collect my thoughts. I would say my review might be a lot partial, I have watched this movie 5 times in theatres in every format available. The movie is everything everyone wanted. Jon Watts üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè you really outdid yourself from the prequels. Let's start with the main crew. Tom Holland, I haven't been a big fan of his spider-man since his take felt a bit childish in the previous movies, but I gotta change my opinion now since, man he felt like a real Peter Parker this time. The Peter Parker known to make sacrifices for the greater good, he was perfect, from the initial childish role to maturing by the end of the movie, it felt unreal. Zendaya, she is just perfect, the best MJ - Michelle Jones that is, but his and Tom's chemistry is perfect, they are made for each other and so are their characters. Ned played a perfect supporting role. And the villains, nobody is better than Willem Dafoe. I guess they all redeemed themselves in a way. Especially Electro, ""I thought you were black"". Oh yeah, Dr. Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch, his and Peter's were nothing but amusing.Now moving on to the story. The daredevil cameo was quick in a rather fully loaded movie. The villains came and started wreaking havoc. Peter ""Tom"" got the line that he deserved when Aunt May dies by the hand of the Goblin. That rage that he felt I could relate to the character so much. The way his friends tried to help him, especially MJ. And then the entry of the two Peter's. Andrew was perfect. I loved him, cause I am from the generation who saw him as the Spider-man. He was amazing, just awesome. Whereas Tobey, his presence felt unreal. I never thought I would be so happy seeing him. And the conclusion and the way the Peters worked together that was the best one of the best action sequences ever. The way they made memes real and yes they talked about the webs, you know how it is produced inside Tobeys Peter. I loved how the conclusion came about where Tobey taught Tom's Peter to not cross the line and stay true to his hero name. And finally when Strange reversed the spell, where Peter made the decision of making everyone forget about him, to save his loved ones. The scene in the bakery where Peter decides not to tell MJ who he is and the new suit. The movie is perfect.IF NOT WATCHED YET, WATCH IT, PLEASE WATCH IT.","9/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","shawthingproductions","16 December 2021","I am not the target audience. I don't mind Marvel films, I don't even mind comics, but I don't obsess over them in the way some people do (and it is fine that they get enjoyment from these films). This review is for people like myself, if you're a fan of Marvel and Spiderman then - simply put - you will love the film.For me, I found I was bored. The running time is long, the story is a little ""meh"" (Spiderman wants to SAVE the villains) and everything is just a little too convenient with plot points coming that are obvious from the get go. In short: It's a cookie-cut film. Marvel has their formula (and clearly it works for them) and they won't stray from that. Sorry, but I am in Ridley Scott's camp. There's no originality anymore.By now you probably already know that other faces do pop up in the film. There are some fun scenes with these characters and I chuckled a couple of times but - the rest of the audience was whooping, cheering and clapping which actually bugged me more as - it meant I missed a lot of dialogue after a character's reveal. Seriously, if you want to chat loudly - stay at home and watch the film instead of forcing others to listen to your inane thoughts.Tom Holland is good as Spiderman and, in this film, he shows a lot of range with his emotion - which was great to see because, until this film, we hadn't really seen that from him but, really, he is the only positive I can think of when it comes to this film. By tomorrow, I would have forgotten most of what I'd just watched.It's average at best. If you're a fan boy, it's the best Marvel film yet. Only you know which camp you belong in (and again, either camp is fine).","9/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","quiqueperezsoler","2 June 2022","The MCU Spider-Man has finally arrived. I had to take some time for this experience to sink in and assimilate what it alone has accomplished in a 2h runtime. Well done, Marvel, well done.For those who criticised this movie of having a ""pandering"" fan service or messy plot didn't quite understand the main purpose and theme of the movie. I am not excusing its possible filmmaking-related flaws, but it never set out to be flawless in the first place and I love that about it.This movie wasn't only about pleasing fans but it was also about providing Tom Holland's Spider-Man of the wake up call it so desperately needed. Everyone who criticised the MCU portrayal of Spider-Man has been proven wrong as the character has evolved and matured over the course of the movies to reach the portrayal we all know and love. Far From Home was a step in the right direction from Homecoming, but this one is the pinnacle of it all. I have to give it to screen writters and everyone creatively involved in the movie from a story perspective because they have outdone themselves. This movie, while not exempt of filmmaking flaws and contrivances, has delivered what we never thought we needed. Maybe it's me, maybe I'm blinded by the fact that any and all plot devices used in this movie are of my liking. In a world of magic and sci-fi, political disputes and spionage are rendered a bit underwhelming to me.About the fan service, this is fan service done right, because it services the story. The multiversal backdrop serves primarily for two things: redemption and realisation. I don't want to get into too much spoilers, but certain characters and emotional moments return to redeem characters who need redemption and for others to realise that actions have consequences. Something that we finally see in an MCU Spider-Man movie, something that ever since its comicbook conception in the 1970s has defined and established the character as one of the best in the industry.Like Dave Filoni said about Star Wars: ""It's not really about what we decorate it with (x-wings, lightsabers, aliens) but the familial conflicts, the emotional turmoil that defines Star Wars and sets it apart from the rest"". Spider-man is not what we decorate it with, is not only about the swinging, the villains, the crazy adventures, it's about the human element, it's about how these affect the Man in Spider-Man. I have always been more fascinated with the portions of the comic where we see internal struggle within Peter, when we see him fail, loose, suffer; because it makes the eventual triumph that much more spectacular.This movie single-handedly fixes whatever I saw was wrong with Tom Holland's Spiderman portrayal and elevated him to the stratosphere, leaving him off with a great prospect on what is to come. Not only that, but every character introduced is given enough moments to shine and takeaway something from this major event. Every single character that I wasn't quite sold on (from the principal ones I mean) have found a place to shine and show performances that enhances the movie, particularly Zendaya, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina.It's one of the most daring MCU plots yet and it also manages to please all the cinematic Spider-Man fans at the same time. Whatever movie flaw it might have I have overlooked them as I do the rest of the MCU movies. These are not meant to revolutionise cinema, they are here to entertain, to provide interesting characters and stories and, sometimes even, to elevate and uplift us.IN CONCLUSION, I have no issues with this movie overall. I have some small nitpicks here and there, mostly to do with some of the comedy and side characters. But other than that, it sets out to do what it intended and, believe or not, serves as both conclusion to the MCU Spider-man and also transitioning movie to the stories to come. And I for one can not wait to see what's in store. If you are a Spider-Man fan you will love this movie because it does everything right, if you are a casual MCU fan you will be entertained and amused; and if you are a casual movie fan this movie might be a bit confusing. But then again, these are comicbook stories, I don't know what to tell you.","8/10"

I honestly didn't think Avengers:Endgame would ever be equaled as a grand MCU movie but this just puts everything before it in the shade, maybe it's because Spiderman is such a beloved superheroe? Maybe it's the imperious special effects? Maybe it's the supporting cast? Who knows but this is the Spider-Man movie you always wanted

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","isaacsundaralingam","17 December 2021","(No Spoilers)Spiderman: No Way Home is probably the biggest superhero movie since Avengers Endgame... There's no denying that. Ever since this movie's announcement, you knew this was a bigger deal than the usual superhero flicks. And being a movie with such high expectations, means that there's so much room for things to go wrong. And unfortunately... It seems like it did.Now I'm fresh out of the theatre, and I already feel like this movie had so much potential wasted. A sentiment I also share towards Avengers Endgame; where the only thing the writers seemed to worry about was 'fan-service'. Fan service is fine honestly, but the line should be when fan-service slowly starts taking over for storytelling. Because the storytelling in this movie was childish.Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie... I enjoyed the theatre experience... It was fun... But fun is not enough when you realize what could have been. Spiderman: No Way Home could have been Marvel's most ambitious project yet, but it has the curse of Marvel's horrible writing staff who similarly messed up everything from Avengers Endgame, to WandaVision, to Falcon and the Winter Soldier, to Loki and to Black Widow. The plot of the movie sounds like some cheap fan fiction that somehow got made. And what's even worse is its absolutely cringe worthy dialogue; existing for the sole purpose of reminding the audience of previous Spiderman movies. It's such a dumb and convenient plot that just exists for the sake of nostalgia.I loved Avengers Infinity War and I really enjoyed Spiderman Far From Home, but I haven't enjoyed a single Marvel project since, because all their projects have been so shallow with no real substance to back itself up. Marvel has a writing problem that needs to be looked into, for the sake of cinema and storytelling.What a missed opportunity... What an absolutely missed opportunity...","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","lucaslw-93145","19 December 2021","This is it. It's what we've all been waiting for. This is the Infinity War equivalent for the Spider-Man movies, it's the most ambitious cross-over in the history of Spider-Man, and honestly, the most ambitious cross-over since Infinity War.Insane cast, Willem Dafoe brings an Oscar-worthy performance, Tom Holland and Marisa Tomei both bring their dramatic A-game, Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprising their roles with heartfelt intensity, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are incredible antagonists (though as far as villains go, Dafoe steals the show, just as Garfield does for the good guys).Insane fan service. Great intro of Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock in official MCU capacity. Fantastic way to bring back Garfield and Maguire. Great choice of villains, even if the 6th member of the Sinister Six was getting drunk in Mexico. We finally get an official ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". Nice meme material, ""You know, I'm something of a scientist myself"" and ""my back"". The fan service here didn't feel forced.Great action. CGI wasn't the best the MCU has to offer, but absolutely gets the job done. I think as the Dr. Strange's skills as a sorcerer have improved, so too have the creativity of the visuals used to depict his spells. Very fresh feel of the mirror dimension this time around, looking forward to seeing it again in the next Dr. Strange film.Most of all, it's a great story. The character growth is dynamic and well paced. It happens on all facets and it's very clear that the writers and Jon Watts have taken to heart criticism of the first two MCU Spider-Man films. There's the heart-wrenching loss of Aunt May (never gets easier to see any Spider-Man losing someone), a serious stepping up of Tom Holland's Peter Parker to be more than just an Iron Man Jr., and an apologetic reminder that Parker is broke (and not a Stark trust fund kid), both during the movie and once again at the end, when his slate is wiped clean. Garfield gets a chance to save Holland's MJ in a very dramatic mini-""redemption arc"". The best part of the script is the motif that Spider-Man's best attribute is his incredible moral compass, and great moral strength, willing to take on all the pain and sacrifice so that his friends and neighborhood can live on prosperously even if he gets left behind. It's an echo that establishes the Spider-Man at the end of the film as a spiritual successor to Capt. America more strongly than it does as an Iron Man Jr. The growth that Maguire and Garfield's Spider-Men bring in helping Holland's Spider-Man realize that vengeance is not what Aunt May would have wanted, and by extension, is not the Spider-Man way is incredibly touching and a fantastic dynamic for the three Spider-Men. Toby Maguire's goodbye in the movie ""You know. It's what we do"" to Tom Holland is a great send-off and acknowledgement that the mantle of Spider-Man is never an easy one to wear, but it's one that Spider-Men in every universe wear with great power and responsibility.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a tale of sacrifice, growth, and redemption. Say what you will about the quantity of the MCU, but the quality of select films like Spider-Man: No Way Home is undeniable, and I hope this isn't the last time we see an adventure as epic as this was.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Behnam-A","12 March 2022","This movie is absolute masterpiece in the term of CGI. But that's all. Other than that, everything is poor and really disappointing even for Marvel standards. It has very poor story telling terrible directing and poor story. To much moral cliches are included which will really bore you.All in all, apart from the computer work, it's a below average teenage film. I was amazed by high rankings and was expecting something like infinity war, at least something like avengers but got very disappointed after watching this childish movie.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","papanloveu","17 December 2021","Honestly fully confident this is best spider-man movie. Found myself subconsciously clapping and just screaming inside with joy. The returns of some characters are incredible. The film balances the comedy with a dark/sad plot to follow. Tom Hollands spider-man in a film so crowded still manages to shine and outdoes himself with his performance. This feels like a true spider-man movie especially in the very last scene. His performance is incredible and some of the action sequences are beautiful with moves taken from the game. This feels like the most badass, realistic and cool portrayal of a spider-man yet. It maintains comic accuracy and tom's suits are beautiful. Some scenes are absolutely heart wrenching, i found myself crying numerous times. This film is a masterpiece and a love letter to all marvel or spiderman fans and a work of art. It avoids the other spider-man movies mistakes and just gives characters such realistic convincing arcs. A true work of art, round of applause for John Watts and Tom Holland.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Horst_In_Translation","20 August 2022","""Spider Man: No Way Home"" (not the best title) is, as you knew already from the title, one of the most recent Marvel movies out there. With the Avengers films over after the Thanos battle, pretty much every character is about to find closure in a way. Oh well, what you saw at the end of the most recent Thor film does not indicate that, but the final sequence with Tom Hardy here is not as much of an introduction to a fourth Spider-Man film, so it will maybe stay at three. The music you heard with the closing credits was also fairly fitting from this perspective. Of course, it is also a great connection to the three Spideys from this film here, but I will get to that a little later. Let's look at the basics first: The director is Jon Watts and he was also in charge of the previous two Spider-Man movies. Same is true for the two writers. It is not a surprise that they got chosen too for this one, but the real surprise was maybe that they got picked for the first film five years ago maybe as they were not really famous. Then again, these Marvel films rarely go for the truly defining filmmakers of our generation, but get in some new blood instead most of the time. Just like this trilogy here. The director worked on several Fatboy Slim music videos in the past and the two writers McKenna and Sommers collaborated on American Dad, which is both pretty cool. As for the cast, you will find a handful names from the previous films, obviously Tom Holland in the lead and also Zendaya who is really cruising right now with her roles here and in Dune. Jacob Batalon looks much more manly in real than in this film where he plays a nerdy character. Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange is really in every Marvel movie these days, which shows how popular he is. Benedict Wong I definitely appreciate here too as always. I like his character a lot, but sadly he does not have a lot of screen time here. Marisa Tomei is also back and she plays the youngest Aunt May you will probably ever come across. Still interesting that she is the only Oscar winner from the original cast here. They brought in another one with an Academy Award, but more about him in a second.The certainly most memorable aspect about this film here is how they used the multiverse idea to include the Spider-Man characters of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire despite how long ago it was for them to portray the character. Well, mostly for Maguire, but it was so cool to see them reprise their roles and the entire idea that they are still Spider-Man and always will be. No matter how much time passes. Of course, I am a little biased here because I adored the Sam Raimi movies back then, at least the first two, and I also quite like Andrew Garfield as an actor. I guess I will always rate these two above Tom Holland who I have disliked for a while, but he has grown a bit on me here admittedly and I will wait with my final judgement until I have checked out his previous two Spider-Man outings. As for the other two, they did not come alone, which adds even more awesomeness. We also get the key antagonists from their movies again. This includes Jamie Foxx, the other Oscar winner I mentioned early on and Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church, even if the latter two did not get featured too much. But Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn were and this was utterly amazing because I love the two characters and also so enjoyed their performances back then and now again in this film. What a blast this was and this is a key reason why I give this film a really enthusiastic recommendation and not just a solid one. I think Doc Ock was the one who we saw first in here in terms of the antagonists they brought back. They all had really cool introductions. Also interesting references about how they do not know about their own deaths, but talk about others' before they realize the gruesome truth. When they were there locked in these chambers, they almost felt like dogs. Dogs that once bit somebody, did something awful, but the protagonist tries to bring them and their hurt souls back and have them live lives as normal human beings without evil taking over.Dr. Strange is not happy about this idea at all and he even follows and fights Spidey over it. He sure could not be kept inside this chamber for long, but spider webs were more effective on one occasion. This role has turned Cumberbatch into an actor who is easier to like for me now after really struggling with him on Sherlock and also on The Power of the Dog very recently, a film that did not impress me one bit. But back to this one here: Strange is of course also the connection to the multiverse once again and with the latter I also keep struggling a bit at times, but here it was alright overall I guess. I remember his comment that they know almost nothing about the multiverse, haven't explored the way it works at all. I second that. Comedy is of course also something you always find in Marvel films and this one here is no exception. Unfortunately, they cannot get in the Stan Lee cameos anymore, but those were never really funny anyway, more like cult. Funny moments here include Strange's reaction when he finds out that Spidey has not even tried to talk to the people from MIT after he and his buddies got rejected. But yeah, I guess saving this woman's life there helped with that then. For me personally, it was very funny when the three Spider-Mans compared their ""web activities"" and certain techniques that the characters had in their films that differed from each other. Like how Maguire's had basically an endless stack of webs and Garfield's character had to literally create his in a lab or something which was exhausting. I guess this was where the superhero aspect already moved a bit aside for science as Garfield's was then a bit more of a Batman approach.What else felt funny? Oh yes, how they encourage each other, especially Garfield's character when they call each other amazing. Like ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". Another charming reference there back to the books and the original title. I could really go on and on here with the moments that will make you smile or maybe even laugh, but I will leave it at that. In any case, the film was also a triumph from this perspective. And I would not say this is a given because I have been critical at times with comedy in Marvel movies and I am referring there a bit to Tony Stark's Iron Man and his sometimes try-hard punchlines and especially to Chris Pratt who has absolutely no comedic talent if his material is not outstandingly good. By the way, Tony Stark is also included briefly in this film here or rather his company I should say. He himself is not for obvious reasons. A few words on Zendaya: I was critical about her too in the past and I still think the way she is overexposed in Hollywood right now does not match her talent as a whole. If we are talking about Spider-Man's romantic interest, I'd probably pick Emma Stone over her, Kirsten Dunst maybe not. Still Zendaya is growing a bit on me as well. I just wish she would go with her full name at some point. That would make it easier to respect her as an actress. Anyway, there was really only one moment here that she had that I did not like, namely when she stands up against Dr. Strange. That was not a strong female moment, but on the cringeworthy side, also how softly Strange reacted to her. He was right really when he said that Holland's Peter Parker is just a boy and that's it. J. Jonah Jameson would definitely agree and it is just a phenomenon how J. K. Simmons keeps portraying the character for decades. Awesome stuff as I adore the actor, but I must still say it is a such a limited character that there was almost nothing to him here this time. Only seeing him early on in his chamber there recording more anti-Spidey propaganda was funny. He surely made him his priority gently-speaking. Or, more accurately, his obsession. So there is a third Oscar winner on board here in fact.As my review is getting closer to an end, I also want to talk a little more about the other Spideys here. They included really great references to their films from years ago that kinda made me want to watch those again at some point in the near future. I mean pretty much their entire inclusion here did. But there were specific moments too and those were not about the comedy like some of the earlier stuff I mentioned, but they were about serious situations. I am referring to Franco's character in these very old films or also how Osborn says he has a job for Parker, just like he liked the character back then and with Garfield's character the most serious moment is of course when he holds Zendaya's character like he held Stone's back then. But Holland's character, the current Spidey, also has his own major loss here. Family affair. The moment was maybe not as touching as I would have liked it to be, so yeah there are negative criticisms for me too with this film for sure, but they are not too major. The good moments are far more frequent. The ending in terms of closure was really nice too with how he runs into certain characters again and we know there is hope for him and with Zendaya's character it is also best if he starts anew and destroys the note he prepared. It's basically as if his universe is a new one as well. Only he remembers what happened. Back to solitude and ready to save the world or at least New York many more times. Look at the cup on the table and what is written on it before he swings out in the end through New York during wintertime. The snow was amazing. At the very end, let me say that you also see Jake Gyllenhaal at the very start in what is a reference back to the second movie from this trilogy. But as I said, the closure to this third film and the entire trilogy could not have been any better. Great job and this makes it very easy to forget some previous mediocrities. Such a creative movie. One of 2021's best. Do not miss out.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Adam-09265","9 June 2022","Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this movie. Although it mainly just looked like a cameo showcase with some connective plot. Even the lines were cameo'd in certain areas to possibly trigger nostalgia more.I sort of liked the story and get what they were trying to do, but it seemed too complicated to be executed with a clean narrative. I don't like how Doctor Strange was down powered by Peter Parker, i know Peter is a smart nerdy kid with powers but it destroyed the whole mystic arts master vibe that we love from Strange. Maybe it's just me that felt that way.Like i said i get the idea but it was too quick of an execution. I guess development would cause the movie to be 5 hours long. It was a little cringy in areas where i noticed plot holes just so they could speed up the story and not give proper explanations. It was just too large of an idea to crush into a 2+ hour movie and make sense.My answer is enjoy the movie through nostalgia and entertainment, don't look for clean story because instead the movie looked like a brag on what Disney can accomplish when making deals with other studios. Using nostalgia as a weapon again, Disney do this all the time.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","fanchnou","4 February 2022","Spiderman Far From Home is to years of stand alone Spider-Man movies what Avenger Endgame was to Avengers: an amazing grand finale to wrap up all the previous adventures in a grand manner, thus allowing a new phase.This allows something very special:
Tobey, Andrew & Tom are no longer three different set of movies, they all come to as one adventure, together.Spidey is now reset to a new beginning (no caretaker, no girlfriend, no best friend). This will allow the building of a whole new story.Because Spidey Tom still remembers it all, this closed chapter can't be dismissed or forgotten, it is the building block of what's to come. It's a bittersweet legacy which opens door to bringing back the past if writers want to go that way at a later stage (after all, a spell can be reversed, most times!).I always loved these three actors, seeing them together was a dream come true I could never have dreamt of in the past. And before you know it, it's already the end of the movie, this is how captivating it is. 10/10 for me for sure!","1/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","aldri-feb","15 December 2021","No Way Home is undeniably the most emotional and the most entertaining of Tom Holland's Spider-Man. It's a full Spidey Fan Service for sure. While in Homecoming and Far From Home, Peter Parker's character felt quite childish, this film would show the transititon of a more grown-up Peter Parker, and Tom Holland did really well for making it happen. Of course No Way Home has many surprises that I won't spoil, but don't expect too much on storyline. The plot is pretty simple actually, and the trailer had already shown almost all the plot. So don't be spoiled if you wanted to have fun watching Spider-Man No Way Home, because the surprise elements are the key of this film.","10/10"

Kindergarten story , most part not logical. Dr strange not in his usual self as he say early he will sacrifice iron man to save the universe and still overlook this and help peter Parker. Ned easily open port while Dr strange train hard to open it. Every 5 min must put in lame joke such as Nel grandma part. Not even funny as it's kill the touching emotional part when both came in. Saving Mj part look too easy and fast ,should put slowmo and flashback like last time Andrew scene. Willem Dafoe nail the whole show with his performance.

The movie got all those star to come back and play in it. And since the first Spiderman movie was around the year 2000, 2 decades of fan came back to flood the scoring with a bunch of 10s. The plot I must say is quite infuriating, they have taken this no killing thing way too far and have decided to make the Tom holland peter a very annoying kid. Perhaps it is because it is the first major film in phase 4, but if they want to create an event to introduce the antagonist in phase 4 at least let it be something cool and not some stupid teenager's stupid mistake.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tm-sheehan","16 December 2021","My Review - Spider-Man : No Way Home
My Rating 8/ 10I've never seen a queue like this one at our local regional Blue Mountains Cinema so it looks like this new Spider-Man movie will be a Box Office bonanza . It certainly needs to be as the estimated Production Budget was an obscene $200 million USDollars .I rated the previous Spider-Man: Far From Home a very respectable 8/10 as I enjoyed it immensely.This movie is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and is the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) takes place directly after the events of Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019). Meaning that it takes place in the Spring/Fall of 2024.With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help. When a spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear, forcing Peter to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.The ingredient I enjoy most in this Marvel franchise and there's a lot of comic book humour in Spider-Man or as I think this one should really be titled Spider-Men. No spoilers but I enjoyed the second half of this long movie more than the first especially when Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire form the formidable trio of Arachnids.It's amazing to me where original quotes from Spider-Man show up and are used by other cultural iconic personalities I didn't realise that Ru Paul's often used quote ""With great power comes great responsibility, which Queen üëë have you chosen to get the CHOPPED? Is a proverb popularized by the Spider-Man comic books written by Stan Lee and published by Marvel Comics
Of course the CGI effects are the best State of the Art but I think it's the great ensemble cast that makes these films so entertaining including the Actor of the moment Benedict Cumberbatch as the Wizard Dr Stange . I particularly enjoyed Zendayer as Peter Parker's girlfriend she has some great moments with Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and she's delightfully natural.Tom Holland helped to save this movie from cancellation by forcing renegotiations between Sony and Disney. Under the terms of the new deal, not only does Spider-Man: No Way Home still take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but Spider-man can also appear in future MCU movies, as well as Sony's own Spider-Man franchise.If Sci Fi Action is your favourite movie genre you'll probably rate this latest Marvel movie higher than my quite high 8/10 Rating but I thought it a bit dull in parts and a tad too long 20minutes longer than Spider-Man : Far from Home which I enjoyed more and that movie only cost a mere $140 million estimated budget to make.Great Escapism Movie - Well done.","1/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","The_Dog_Father","23 July 2022","I couldn't find one thing to like about it.Such a climatic ending and cliff hanger for Spider-Man Far From Home, and this starts out flat as an opened, left in the car for a week, diet no caffeine coke.I was in shock how pathetically written the movie started out, doing an ""okay, all is forgotten, you kids can get on with your life now."" Sloppy, lazy, and insulting, even to the youngest of fans out there.Like a date promised to go to a nice restaurant, and they end up getting treated to that one hot dog at the gas station that has been on the back rotisserie for a day and half.As we get over the first absurd shock, the movie just keeps getting worse and worse, more ridiculous as the plot unfolds. Recycled parts, with a really bad appearance with Dr. Strange in it. Their tango together and how that was written is even more absurd than the story line itself. This obsession to defy rules without maturity, by this 3rd Spider-Man, was just too annoying to even come close to liking it. It must be part of the mental issues with kids out there now, ""I can fix it, and save the bad guys.""So very anti-climatic from leaving off from ""Far From Home."" Stale, horrible plot, worst script, and so very dull. I wonder if Samuel L. Jackson saw the original script, and was ""Ahhh hellNaw, I ain't doing this sh t.""For the love of Christmas and all that is Holly and Jolly, get someone who can write, produce, and direct these movies. Let the fans have a go at, or the film students who would do it for room and food truck. They couldn't do any worse, I promise.","8/10"

There is no character no soul left in these corporate franchises.Content like this doesn't matter, it is just like another Fifa or Madden game every year.

They even throw in Daredevil and Venom cameos! Then add on the fact that they actually try to SAVE all the villains rather than kill them...It's just fantastic...If you're a Spiderman fan, or a superhero fan, this is a mut-watch, and if you're not, you should see it anyway!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","impendingdd","4 June 2022","Villains were standing around most of the movie. Tobey was hugely wasted. Makes no sense whatsoever how he doesn't even acknowledge that the man he watched Die (Norman Osbourne) and btw his dead best friend's dad, is living before him in the flesh. No shock, no emotion. Even just for a small moment. Didn't need to take away Tom's shine at all. The director or Marvel says, hey let's give him a moment with Doc Ock! It's just really mind boggling how they go out of their way to be mediocre. This movie is just as bad as the other films of the trilogy. It's boring. It's depressing. Peter in this movie is very annoying and unbelievably naive, even for what most people will say is excusable because he's ""just a kid."" No one cared enough for this Aunt May to die as much as we would have cared for the Aunt May from Tobeys universe because we felt their connection. Lets be honest the relationship with Happy was weird. Happy crossed a major boundary slamming Peter's aunt. Totally uncomfortable. If anyone thinks I should be grateful because at least we see all three generations of Spidey on screen, I don't understand the logic. If I get free ice cream and it tastes like dog turd I'm not gonna be thrilled and say ""hey at least it's free ice cream!"" Im allowed to say what I dislike. Stop settling for mediocrity when better films have been made.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tarynabryant","17 December 2021","As a huge Doctor Strange fan who is more than ready for more of the multiverse, I had very high expectations for No Way Home. Unfortunately, it was a let down. Sure it caters to fans with some nostalgic moments, but relies way way way too much on the fan service while lacking in pretty much all other areas. The story was all over the place, pacing was very wishy-washy, and the writing was horrendous for the most part. It felt very childish and cheap at a lot of moments with jokes that just did not land at all and some super corny dialogue. My best friend and I were genuinely confused at the amount of laughs, cheers, and claps from our audience in the theater tonight (and we are both very big Marvel fans, my best friend being a long-time, devoted spidey fan). So believe me when I tell you that we really wanted to love this movie. Honestly our favorite part of the entire film was the post-credits features. If anything, this movie only further solidified my belief that Tom Holland is the weakest of the Spider-Mans. Not necessarily his fault, but rather the fault of the writers for trying way too hard to make him a quirky, shy, stuttery, awkward teenager and not giving him any real development or depth to his character aside from maybe the two seconds after May's death and his fight with Osborn where we see a glimpse of a dark side in him, but that's it. Additionally, killing off May was just so lame. It reeked of ""we need to kill off a character for some kind of shock value but not anyone too important"". Another moment that I don't understand is when Toby is seemingly fatally injured in a sudden and surprising moment towards the end of the film, but then is all of a sudden okay a few minutes later? There were just too many moments that felt like it was relying on audience reactions and surprise in order to come across as a good movie. I think the main reason it is receiving such praise right now is because of the current hype around Andrew and Toby reprising their roles (which was great fun don't get me wrong), but in the long run didn't feel like it served much of a purpose to the actual story beyond wanting to drop a bombshell on fans. By the fifth conversation/conflict about how Peter can ""cure"" the villains and save the world, the entire movie became a jumbled and chaotic mess. Interesting concept but executed poorly.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mattflohr","21 February 2022","Tom Holland's third featuring entry as the titular web-slinger is a masterpiece. The character development is poignant and heartfelt. The love for the source material is in every frame. All of the actors are brilliant and nobody phones in anything. This could so easily have felt like nostalgia bait but it's so much more than that. Willem Dafoe's performance alone is worth the price of admission. He is unbelievably good in this movie. Andrew Garfield is perfect. Tobey Maguire is perfect. Tom Holland has always been great and this is his best performance. Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are perfect. Cimenatography stunning. Script is once in a lifetime. They do so much in this movie and they pull off all of it. Comedy beats are wonderful and often ingenious. Drama is heartwrenching and believable. Instantly relatable. We don't deserve a movie this good. This movie didn't have to be this good. But it is and I love it.Does it have any faults? The story doesn't make a lick of sense, but that's okay. The actors sell it.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","bgaiv","10 May 2022","This is my small voice about this movie. It Iooks like it made great bucks for the studio which is fine.But renting this, I'm glad I didn't sit through it in a theater. It's very very long and laborious and doesn't, to me, concentrate on what makes Spidey great.Spider-Man is charming because he's a kid, like other kids, but burdened with a super power.This extreme world ending, world shattering stuff is so heavy and extreme.Maybe I'm old fashioned, but maybe even a feature film could still be about a kid struggling to solve local real world problems?","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","loganschainker","28 April 2022","This is without a doubt the best film of last year. This is one of the best films in the MCU and is definitely on par with Spider-Man 2 for my favorite Spider-Man film. It is chocked full of surprises. In terms of filmmaking Dune was more well made and crafted, but in terms of what entertained me and me laugh, feel emotion for... No Way Home delivered. I saw it three times, and though I will admit there are some plot holes but nothing too distracting.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jaysanchu07","14 March 2022","A certified crowd pleaser, No Way Home had me grinning from ear to ear with my finger pointed at the screen far too often. It is definitely my favorite of the Tom Holland films, and a shade under Spiderman 2 as the best one yet. To see Alfred Molina, William Dafoe and Jamie Foxx reprising their roles, was INSANE. Each of their entrances caused goosebumps and their acting, pure nostalgia! Props to Dafoe! His voice and facial expressions remains perfect for the Goblin 20 years later. Really, the reality where we see these characters together is unthinkable, yet here we have it, and the film ensures its more than fan service! Spiderman, choosing to 'cure' gives these characters a shot at the main theme of the film, redemption. This brings us to the grandest (& most spoiled) reveal in recent years, the appearance of the other Spidermen! It is difficult to comprehend and put into words the feeling of seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield suit up. Filmmakers even graces its fans by showing PLENTY of these Parkers as they play huge roles in the third act, complimenting the emotional themes of the film. In fact, my favorite redemption story arch was that of Andrew's. I was blown away by how invested he was. When he caught Zendaya's MJ, his outpour of raw emotions sent shivers down my spine. It was gratifying to see the filmmakers give him justice. Another positive is we finally have a mature version of Tom Holland's Spidey. We see his mistakes and struggles to confront its consequences, themes of a grounded and relatable superhero we love and admire.All positives mentioned, the film does have shortcomings in its plot. There were moments I feel unnecessary like Aunt May's demise, Sandman's motivation and everything Ned. The premise that 'too many requests' during the spell casting ushered the multiverse crisis had a weak hold on me, and to blame it on Spiderman was a head scratcher. The film does however, a tremendous job of giving us things to love to overcome these holes. The sheer volume of iconic characters is a remarkable feat no one thought possible.Spiderman: No Way Home is then, a well packaged present as it delivers what both hardcore and casual fans want and desire. And for that, I give a score of 8.5/10.","8/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","artbyabhi","31 December 2021","It's an OK movie, an average movie, which has characters from other movies because the studio who purchased the other studios had those characters.Simple, nothing wrong with it.This is a basic yawn-worthy story line, containing nothing for a serious movie human, with faulty plot lines. No problem with that. Every week there is one or the other weak movie being premiered and get bashed as per their standard.What amazes me is the mass public reaction towards this movie, sometimes dubbing it as the best Marvel or Spider-man movie of all time. No it is not.It is simply not worthy of a single-time watch.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mr_sharma","15 December 2021","As I've said in some of my past reviews, some people only know two ratings, either a 1 or a 10.When every review, I see, is putting out a 10/10, perhaps one should step back and get some perspective. This isn't The Godfather!If you've enjoyed Holland's other outings, you will enjoy this.The trailer gives you clues as to what to expect AND I would strongly suggest you watch all previous Spider-Man films (the Sam Raimi versions and the ""amazing Spider-Man"" versions).It'll help.First of, the film is certainly fun and funny. Lot's of jokes and in jokes.There is some lag though. There is whole 10 minute scene in Happy's apartment that plods a little but then we're back to it.I think of all the previous Spider-Man relationships, Hollands and Zendya's is the most believable (well that may well be as they are a couple in real life).The film is sort of like a sweet nostalgia trip.There are a few questions, we as the audience needed answering and which are even asked in the film, but the answers are never given. Despite that, it does a very good job of resolving a lot and putting to bed a number of issues from past films.I have said nothing of the plot nor do I intend to.The reason you are reading this review is either you want to understand why I didn't give it a 10/10 and therefore why am I not fanboying over it or you genuinely want to know whether it's worth seeing in the cinema.The answer to the first question is that it's a very good film but it won't make my top 10 of all time. There is a lot thrown at this and a lot of it sticks but some of it doesn't quite hit the mark.The answer to the second question is well it depends on the cinema.My advise is that you go see it a big screen, good seating, social distanced cinema. You want that cinematic experience.I went to an multiplex with people sitting next to each other in a reasonably packed theatre with a screen which, frankly by today's standard, was bog standard to small (which surprised me considering the calibre of film being shown),So yeah, go see it (especially if you've seen all the previous ones) but on a grand big old screen cinema with comfortable seating.Enjoy.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","AdrenalinDragon","15 December 2021","One of the best Spider-Man movies ever. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fanservice galore fest done extremely well with jokes, emotion, and heart added to the mix. Not only giving closure to so much of Spider-Man's character, but also for the fans who always wondered how certain things would play out if they happened. This is a movie you need to witness.Picking up right off from Spider-Man: Far from Home, the film gets straight into action with dealing on consequences and trying to amend outcomes. In some ways similar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film stays interesting from scene after scene and never misses a beat. Solid action set pieces and character interactions give the film a lot of fun things to work with, and by the end everyone was clapping and cheering.Without spoilers, No Way Home will please most people who are familiar with all the previous Spider-Man films. I got a little emotional and attached when certain characters popped up again and I definitely didn't feel the movie was a quick-in cashgrab at all. The performances were all really good, the special effects were top notch, and some of the music will be familiar to the fans.In the end, it proves Marvel can still pull off a really entertaining yet rewarding movie for Spider-Man fans. Some minor criticisms I have is there are a few contrivances and maybe some characters could have gotten a bit more screentime, but in the end I had such a blast with what the movie set out to do. No Way Home will probably be my favourite film of 2021. Try to go without spoilers though, it will be more satisfying.8.5/10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","albertucciopazzuccio","25 July 2022","The best Spiderman ever. I frankly don't like the start. Too fast, too confusing but then it gets better and better. And when the other 2 Spiderman join....it gets really awesome.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","siderite","15 March 2022","This film was entertaining enough. I liked the acting, the little gems, the sheer hubris of the story. However, it was for all intents and purposes, a universe consolidation move (before they break it all again in Multiverse of Madness). It's one of those reset stories, but one that manages to unite previous resets, which makes it the resettiest of them all. It is there to basically answer all the comic geek questions about how could so many films and reboots and stories exist in the same MCU and open the door to the future.There were no real new characters, some were explained away, some where killed off and new concepts of the incoming threats hinted at. One end-credits scene winked towards a Venom recrossing, while the second was basically a trailer for the next Doctor Strange film, not a ""scene"".So there is a difference between the typical Marvel cinematic universe film and this one: the villain(s) are weak and unfocused while the plot, however entertaining, just a background to the goal of the film: to stabilize the canon and prepare for the new Doctor Strange movie. This does mean the Strangeverse will grow and possibly be amazingly fun, but also that I don't see the Avengers going anywhere for a long while, except maybe TV series.In conclusion: for the fans of the Marvel stories and the faithful viewers of movies and series in that universe, this is a big nice bonus, a step on a promising ladder of new content. However as a standalone film it has limited value. It is a good film, and probably a necessary one, but its storytelling will not blow your mind in any way.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mrashtastic89","19 December 2021","Yes, that statement is really bold, thinking about the original 2 but I can firmly say that it is true, Spider-Man No Way Home is the best movie of the whole entire year, yes, even better than Zack Snyder's Justice League.I can't believe they actually did it.This film is the perfect culmination of everything leading up to this point, the performances are unforgettable, Molina and Holland give the best performances I've ever seen from them, they are unbelievable here.Dafoe is perfect, his performance is haunting.This film has the best action sequences since The Avengers, the direction was insane, mind-blowing really.But it's not just that, it takes risks, I will not spoil anything for you, but this movie touches all the heartstrings.Cumberbatch is incredible in this, even better than usual.Also, it is one of the funniest films Marvel has ever made, every line spoken fits perfectly.They did such an amazing job bringing everyone back, and the special effects were exquisite, as I've come to expect from Marvel.I loved every single second, it's a mind-blowing, exhilarating ride from start to finish, I will be seeing it again in theaters, 2 and a half hours never felt so short and entertaining, I didn't want it to stop.I'll just get what you know is coming out of the way, I'm gonna give Spider-Man No Way Home an A+.I will be remembering it for years.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tareqzaghal","3 September 2023","No Way Home is like a fever dream. It's the type of film that would be made up by fans on YouTube using fake fan trailers or discussions on Reddit. It's a film that truly feels like a pop culture phenomenon, something that cannot be replicated, and an experience people will yearn to have been part of in the cinema in years to come.To critique such a film would be a waste of any viewer's time, you would be missing out on enjoying the entertainment present here, which is amplified a hundred times if you are a fan of all these different incarnations. Corny jokes, flat dialogue and line delivery, some rushed CGI, and lots of instants where things have to happen without making sense in order for the plot to move forward, yes all of that is abundantly present here. If that is to your disliking, that's fair.But it's just a lot of fun, incredibly entertaining and rewatchable, and weirdly comforting. This is undoubtedly Watt's best direction in his trilogy, the entirety of the curing sequence at the flat is beautifully executed, especially the action scenes. The last hour specifically is really tight. It stands out amongst the other Holland films as the one that is best acted, shot, choreographed, structured, and overall most entertaining.Dafoe is devastatingly good as Osborn, a role that might never be done better. Doc Ock is great. Foxx is mostly annoying but provides some good comedic relief. The Lizard is just weird. Sandman is just there. Tobey's return feels rightfully tender. Andrew is still the best one, and the most underrated. Yet, it's impressive that Holland remains at the centre of all the immense nostalgia-bait and fan service, and carries the film on his shoulders, his best performance so far.I hope the next instalment really focuses on a grounded Peter Parker, away from all the Avengers level-threats and multiverse conundrums. Street-level. NYC. Manhattan. College. Daily Bugle. Oscorp. Give me the good stuff pleaaaaase Feige.The MCU can end here, unless they can pull off the Fantastic Four.","5/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","unununbelievabledeals","7 June 2023","I like spider-man films but honestly this one was too lame already. Lazy writing with weak character motivations (esp Sandman and lizard) and major loopholes in the story. Inconsistent personality from doctor strange and Tom holland Peter.I watched the extended cut. Felt bored a halfway through the film when Tom holland Peter was gonna send the villains back, and didn't feel for any character throughout the film, esp Tom holland Peter he's so stupid in the film.This film is just a bunch of stupid mistakes filled with loopholes just to get the to ""epic climax shot"" of the 3 peters and 5 villains fighting jumping slo-mo to battle each other.Honestly just a fan service film. LOVED Spider-Man homecoming which had good character motivation, plot twists and action sequences.This one even the action was flat. Disappointed and glad I didn't watch it in cinemas.","4/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","fernandoschiavi","19 June 2022","After months of rumors, theories and speculation, there was a certain fear that expectations around the film had become so high that it would be impossible to meet them. However, this third Spider-Man solo film within the MCU delivers exactly what fans expected and wanted, nothing less and nothing more. The film brilliantly resolves all the criticisms and complaints from most fans; Peter Parker in the MCU was too tight. He wasn't a penniless photographer and student, Aunt May wasn't worried about the bills, there wasn't a J. J. Jameson behind him.Aware of the importance that the Spider-Man has conquered in these almost 20 years, Sony and Marvel Studios have taken the path of nostalgia and made No Return Home a great celebration of this legacy without abandoning the current journey of the Friendly Neighborhood. The biggest proof of this is in the opening minutes of the production, which picks up exactly where Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019) had left off. With the adventurous and almost uncompromising tone characteristic of the two previous films, the story doesn't take long to give the young man a taste of the consequences of being treated as a public enemy by the population. So he turns to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. In the best of intentions, the wizard helps the boy, who ends up disturbing the spell to the point of opening cracks in the much talked about multiverse. This intervention results in the Multiverse being inserted once and for all in the MCU - before, with brushstrokes in Loki, WandaVision and What If...? - And that brings back Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, the Lizard and the Sandman. The reason why the gallery of villains from the different versions of Spider-Man in the movies is gathered is not only commendable, but also a hallmark of Spider-Man and the guiding thread of the entire plot: good for good.Gradually, No Return Home abandons the simplicity that has been Spider-Man's trademark in the MCU and begins to add seriousness in a gradual, but efficient way. More than denying what they did in Homecoming (2017) and Far from Home, screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers promote a more than welcome evolution for the hero and those around him. This also contributes to giving the adventure the epic tone it deserves. This chapter is clearly a coming-of-age plot for today's young Peter Parker from beginning to end. The production delivers numerous factors that lead to the character's growth, providing key moments to make him a leading and somewhat independent hero. While his previous films promise such a question, this is definitely the project that lives up to its evolutionary premise. The film plays in the face of the hero and those who watch that he has to face real and painful consequences, to learn about the responsibilities that come with the mantle he chose to wear to help people and that's exactly what the film addresses: growing up in narrative magnitude and make the character grow in development.Despite the plot seem lost at the beginning, and probably, tiring in very brief moments, and being just an ambitious film that will play with fan service to win over its viewers, everything makes a lot of sense in the journey. This is not a production that wants to please the audience with its huge catalog of characters for nothing. Spider-Man: No Return Home is fun, electrifying and exciting, like a roller coaster full of surprises, and luckily, it delivers great memorable moments. There is a lot to process here, with several characters to assimilate and contain the emotion for what is yet to come, however, there is a very well distributed division to highlight that each figure present is an essential piece to compose this great puzzle that makes clear the extremely well-crafted script by the duo Erik Sommers and Chris McKenna.Knowing the weight of each character involved, whether those who already inhabit this universe, such as Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and the inseparable Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) and MJ (Zendaya), or the villains who return, the text of the duo of screenwriters finds space to deal with each one more than satisfactorily. With so many people involved, the story ran the risk of becoming a mess, but this problem was overcome with a balance rarely seen in Marvel productions.The script strives to give moments to each of these characters and the direction of Jon Watts takes the cue to translate that into memorable moments. Full of reverence for what Sam Raimi and Marc Webb did in the pre-MCU Spider-Man films, the director does his best work in front of the hero by stepping out of his comfort zone and taking advantage of the possibilities created by the presence of so many iconic characters. The action scenes are full of energy and really exciting. With text that quickly ties who the visitors from other universes are to potential viewers who haven't seen Spider-Man's previous adventures on the big screen, No Return Home has a clear path to give them space to shine. With a function as simple as it is functional in the plot, they dominate the stage and enjoy every minute - with dialogue that works almost like inside jokes with fans that bring nostalgia without sounding gratuitous.Not by chance, the script is full of situations to catch the audience by the heart. It's nostalgic to see Maguire talking about his MJ or even the brotherly look he gives Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) when they meet again, just as the way the story presents Garfield's Peter as this someone bitter for having been unable to save Gwen Stacy - and makes for a great redemptive moment for that. It's impossible not to vibrate with each of these references to the point where you want more movies for each of them. PFor this reason, it is easy to overlook some inconsistencies or things poorly explained. It doesn't matter why Electro (Jamie Foxx) has become so much more villainous than he was in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or even the swings the Lizard (Rhys Ifans) and Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) have in their motivations. All of this is easily overlooked in favor of the fun that this great party offers. This makes Homecoming like a big comic book come to life. In a story like this, you don't expect a big epic or anything like that, but a fun adventure that excites and leaves you excited at the end. And the new Spider-Man is all of that, even in the little things - from the appearance of Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) to the famous phrase ""With great power comes great responsibility"". The film delivers everything you expect.The classic Marvel formula humor is properly placed in the plot, working properly between these, highlighting the incredible return of Doctor Octopus by Alfred Molina, and the great and fun comic relief of the film, Jacob Batalon, playing Ned, best friend of Peter. And in addition to not having gained as much prominence in the two previous Spider-Man films, Zendaya finally earns her space, as well as becoming a beautiful and significant part of Parker's essence.Already the performance of Tom Holland is a major factor for everything to be even more fun and make the process interesting. He proves that he's not just a young man brimming with Spidey humor with no real problems. There's a sense of connection through every screen moment through his brilliant performance, underscoring that he's worthy of taking on the Peter Parker mantle for pop culture. Holland's growth is visible and rewarding, and is consecrated as his best performance to date in the MCU.The villains work very well together, however, there is no way to put aside and highlight Willem Dafoe's unique performance as the Green Goblin. The villain who marked a generation in the first Spider-Man movie starring Tobey Maguire shows in every way how timeless his relationship with the role is, even taking for himself, breathtaking action scenes. It's also visible how Jamie Fox grew up with Electro, gracing every screen moment he was present.Aware of the responsibility at hand, No Way Home comes to an end as a comic book adaptation that is not afraid to embrace more fanciful aspects. And he does it with pride, because he abandons the worry of looking cool or modern. It is curious that Marvel Studios, which usually fills its productions with clues to the future, has decided to look back on the Spider-Man case. After putting Peter Parker under the wing of several figures in its universe, the studio seems to finally have the courage to emancipate him, and it does so by celebrating a story built over nine films, dozens of cartoons and thousands of magazines.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tallinnuk","15 December 2021","Points:1. Tom Holland, Zendaya, Andrew Garfield and the rest give 10/10 performances.2. Brilliant action with outstanding CGI given they had a year maybe less.3. May's death is a beautiful scene left for as long as it should have and Tom Holland is brilliant.4. Every character from the multiverse felt like themselves and Andrew's performance solidified his Peter as the most comic accurate.5. Even though it is a multiverse movie (which can get confusing) you still understand everything and it all makes sense.6. This is Tom Holland's film even with the two Spider-Men, they still make sure he is the main focus.7.

I have so many questions about what happens next for him. How do you live when nobody knows you exist? Movie was just fantastic. Perfect fan-service, nostalgic, heartbreaking, intense, and hilarious. Everyone was perfectly presented and got the necessary screen time (which endgame failed to properly do). I hope to never forget tonight and the way this made me feel.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","rockdude-68045","15 February 2022","In summary this movie was well received and for good reason because it's a solid good movie. With that being said it wasn't great and it wasn't the best spiderman movie. It heavily relied on nostalgia to carry the plot and development and while I can appreciate it all it didn't exactly climax as I was hoping for. Felt like the marvel series as of late just compiled into a movie instead of episodes.Tom holland uses up the last of his awkward teen spiderman attitude in a overdue effort for his character to finally start truly evolving. Yet it comes pretty slow over the course of this film. Additionally, the main conflicts in this movie basically are all spidermans faults when you really think about it which makes it even less of a plot arch due to the circular reasoning behind the movie.Nostalgically it carries the film for obvious reasons and while I loved what happens I feel like it wasn't as wholesome as I expected it to be.. I guess I just got a high expectation from all the great feedback of the film.There were some glaring issues with the plots reasoning and motivations but I get it. Overlooking some of those things it felt like this film was just a filler marvel movie to set up for the next phase and it showed up in its quality. Felt more like a movie special for tom holland instead of a side series that marvel did for loki, wandavision, wintersoldier, and hawkeye. Basically the same quality and effort except instead of a series you got a movie with nostalgia.It was still a solid film to watch but not exactly top tier from marvel. Still loved the nostalgic parts though! They might have carried this movie but it worked!","8/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","slowcando","3 January 2024","No spoilers or plot-summary here. If you're a fan of all the Spider-Man movies of the last 20 years then stop reading reviews and go see! Otherwise...While Endgame was also a fan-service movie, the premise was acceptable, stakes felt tense, the characters acted 'in-character' and the whole production was pulled off very smoothly.No Way Home is similar in fan-service only, everything else doesn't match Endgame's quality:the premise is so blatantly contrived by Doctor Strange's out-of-character irresponsible illogical behaviour that I had trouble the entire movie suspending my disbelief. So much for him being 'the adult in the room'.the stakes never felt particular interesting. It was all a bit 'so what?'.Tom Holland's battered fish-out-of-water shtick is getting old. By the third movie the hero should be quite emotionally grown already.the attempted redemption of the villains only cheapens them as characters. If they have no agency, then they have no 'character'. Endgame had a similar problem when resetting Thanos's motivations but that character still felt like an epic threat, which is what we want from such movies. Otherwise, where is the tension or excitement gonna come from?the plot-resolution was so over-the-top and logically-ridiculous. We obviously accept a lot of nonsense from superhero movies, but they still require a certain quality of internal-logic, otherwise you can literally just make anything up.Overall not a bad film, of course. It was well-made, fairly entertaining despite the flaws. Pacing ok. Good work from the cast. Zendaya decent value again, tho' her character is morphing into the 'crying damsel/emotional sponge' trope. Some fun FX, even if the Mirror Universe was more interesting in the first Strange movie (and Peter Parker's ""it's just geometry"" to get the better of the Master of the Mystic Arts was eye-rollingly poor).From the three Spider-Man films only Homecoming was a really good one. The other two are skippable. No Way Home has a whopping 8.2 rating on here, which I think makes it the highest-rated MCU movie outside of Infinity War/Endgame. So I expect especially Spider-Man fans to love it. But for casuals who are looking for the quality of the best Infinity Saga movies...well, this one may be a disappointment.Personally, I'm almost done with Marvel, just gonna do the second Doctor Strange movie, and finish with Guardians 3. Not gonna bother with any of the series or other movies. The reviews seem middling, and this Multiverse arc isn't that interesting, frankly.","1/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mocaler","8 January 2022","It's been a while since a movie felt like a complete waste of time. There are so many existing stories which could be adapted yet they went with this. The popularity of this is depressing. The multiverse is ridiculous. The number of villains were ridiculous, The dialog of the 3 spider-men was rather bad at points. The McGuire Spider-man tells the Garfield Spider-man that he is amazing repeatedly. That was such a call-back to the previous movie titles that it motivated me to take a bathroom break.Since there are going to be multiple movies with multiverse as a key plot device, I am ending my interest in the MCU.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","nogodnomasters","27 February 2022","Remember when they killed off Emma Stone?Spider-man requests Dr. Strange cast a spell to make everyone forget who he was except a few people. As a result villains who he has killed return from across the multiverse. You are expected to know string theory. Their return causes havoc and Spider-man must find a way to cure them before Dr. Strange kills them.In the grand scheme of things, Marvel has gone out of its way to explain the other Spider-man movies when no one really wanted or expected one.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jackransom-69832","15 December 2021","Easily the most anticipated and theorised comic book film since Avengers: Endgame. Spider-Man: No Way Home is set directly after the end of Far From Home. With Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. When the spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear.It was always going to be difficult for this to live up to the myriad of potential expectations that had built up in mine and millions of others heads after the first trailer released back in August. Luckily throughout its duration No Way Home excels at fan pleasing moments and truly giving Peter monumental stakes and potential consequences. However it is undeniably overstuffed and choppy, as well as for me personally a lot of the MCU'isms not always particularly gelling well with the returning villains.I will be keeping the plot details vague, but for those who had expectations and ideas of what the film might be, it probably is pretty much what you expect. The opening act ripple effect of Peter's identity being revealed, with he, MJ and Ned being turned down by colleges and constant harassment sets the stage well and understandably Peter's desperation for Doctor Strange to fix it. From there the rogues gallery pour through and it's up to Peter to stop them.Here is where some of my favourite aspects of the film are, as well as my irritations. It's undeniably great seeing these characters return to the big screen, and throughout the second act it is uniquely executed and delivers some satisfying interactions between the foes (though some of their motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out), as well as time to breathe. However it is once again the abundance of joke attempts and alterations to a couple of the characters that just make some of the interactions feel awkward and cringe inducing.Doc Ock's bridge battle is a standout return and the choreography, sound design and score all intertwine nicely. Holland wasn't lying about this being a darker and more violent entry into the franchise, with the first Goblin brawl being the film's highlight, alongside the jaw-dropping visual spectacle of the mirror dimension duel. The final action set piece is pure spectacle and grin inducingly fun, it's just a shame that yet again it's another CGI heavy sequence set at night, so it's frequently hard to see what's going on at certain points.This is probably Holland's best Spider-Man performance as he really has some emotional heavy lifting to do, as well as keeping the quips and enthusiasm fresh. Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the film. He's still got all of it: the grin, the laugh, the expressions and genuine menace. Molina as well, brilliantly capturing the commanding intelligence and personality of Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx is far better suited in this iteration of Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch adds a layer of bitterness and snark to Strange, yet keeps his core values and dedication to help in check.Spider-Man: No Way Home may just be the film many fans of dreamed of. Unfortunately for me, whilst it still delivered a lot of what I wanted, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. Dafoe & Molina prove once again why Spider-Man 1 & 2 will never be topped, the increased personal stakes for Peter are welcome and I'm still partially in awe that the film actually happened. However the leering presence of now extremely familiar and annoying MCU traits and tropes, certain character interactions and an overstuffed storyline do hold it back.","3/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","chrishellovart","3 January 2022","Unreal.This is the kind of film where I felt like it was both an honor and a privilege to watch it.I grew up watching the original Spider-Man movies. I never really got into Tom Holland's Spider-Man, but I'm not sure if any future Spider-Man movies will ever be able to top this.I haven't watch many, nor do I really care about the other Avengers and their respective movies, but this is a must watch for Spider-Man fans.I'm going out of my way to review this movie, a review which maybe no one will read, but I need to get some of this awe off my chest.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jackgdemoss","17 December 2021","Spider-Man is fantastic for 2 hours out of it 2.5 hour run-time. The finale certainly dwindles but that isn't the biggest fault. The problem for me was with it's over-abundant fan service and the disingenous marketing surrounding the movie.I don't usually mark spoilers but it feels necessary here. It felt like this was supposed to be the film that got the multiverse started beyond the Loki series, and it truly doesn't. It is an entirely self-contained story. Even the venom tease from venom 2 post credits does not come to fruition, and instead, just passes through to another post credits scene to further tease.The film did have mostly positives across the board which kept it at an 8 for me. In particular, I think this is the best sound design in a Marvel film to date. The punches, terrain shattering, and dialgoue were so crisp and distinct. The sound scape just felt right in every scene and I would love Christopher Nolan to take some notes prior to directing his next thriller.","1/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","yoshbuck","8 June 2022","Although this movie has some horrible pacing, especially in the film's first half, where some scenes feel so abrupt, with that said, this movie slaps harder than me testing a fresh watermelon. I don't want to go in-depth cause there is a lot to unpack in this film. So I will say that this is one of the best Spider-Man adaptations and one of the most important. This movie has an excellent balance of humor and tragedy, heroism and villainy, and the vast characters this film brings. If this rating/review is about portraying the challenges a hero encounters and the actions they must make, and how they portrayed Peter Parker so well, this movie would be a 10/10. Without a doubt.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Pradeep6097089","20 May 2022","Warning: SpoilersI loved that the earlier Spiderman heroes appeared again, and that interaction was good. Else, this was a very boring and stretched film. The thing about Maths overpowering superpowers was silly too. All the actors acted very well, but the premise of the film was comical. I liked the spell-scene which showed the limitation of 'spells'. I hope creators show their normal, day-to-day lives too, instead of clubbing multiple characters together. Spiderman has superpowers but is also desperate to enrol into an elite college? Isn't saving lives enough for our wunder-kid?","7/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","alekspredator87","25 July 2022","In the vast world of the Avengers, the appearance of Spider-Man performed by Tom Holland was greeted very warmly. The young hero is very much loved all over the world, and the successful Infinity Saga, which was just gaining momentum, was replenished with a famous character to please the public. Two solo albums followed, which were well received by the audience. Well, the announcement of the third film about Parker's life and his meeting with heroes from other universes raised interest in the upcoming film to the skies, perfectly playing on the fact that even fans of films with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield will also be interested in the project. The option really turned out to be a win-win, while giving the audience another high-quality story.The plot plot, however, looks kind of ridiculous, implicates Doctor Strange here. The magician and the magician reacts to Peter's request, in my opinion, somehow not in an adult way. But we all understand that if the magician had refused the young Spider, the story would not have happened at all (although everything is difficult here because of other projects, including Loki and Wanda/ Vision). Nevertheless, a certain solution triggers a chain of events that demonstrate a lot of interesting content on the screen.It cannot be said that the film was created exclusively for fans. The story is strong and allows Tom Holland's Peter Parker to grow up, rising to a new level. The dramatic events that meet the audience during the narration necessarily affect the personality of the young Spider, perfectly demonstrating that he will have to answer for any of his decisions on his own. He is no longer a teenager, and the stakes are high, often it's human lives. And if you have decided to act the way you acted, then be ready to answer for the consequences, even if it hurt your heart unbearably.This film shows well who and how of the characters moves further along their storyline. There are a lot of heroes and villains here, whose fate is really interesting to know. Well, the great trinity will definitely make you not only smile, but also worry about the fate of everyone, especially in the finale of the story. Viewers will see a reverent and respectful attitude towards the previous Spider-Man franchises. The presented characters will tell how they lived at a time that we have not been able to see on the screen, they will tell, it seems, everything that is needed to ensure that the audience has a general picture of their worlds.However, do not forget that this is still a film about the current Spider-Man. The picture will be focused on it. Holland has surpassed himself in terms of acting. A young man together with his hero turns from a teenager into a young man who is ready to live as an adult and independent person, having left the custody of older comrades. Finally, you begin to understand that in future tapes he will no longer need mentors, such as Tony Stark, Nick Fury, Happy Hogan or Stephen Strange. And after the end credits, you catch yourself thinking that the trilogy about the guy that happened is just the teenage period of Spider-Man. And the potential of his individual future stories is very great.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" has become a great blockbuster. It has everything you need for a successful movie. The stars have converged. The successful, but recently stalling Marvel cinematic universe has given fans of the past and present a really worthwhile project. The creators have successfully entered into their Fourth phase about the Multiverse a strong project that is directly related to it, and also thanks to an uncomplicated plot gave the world the opportunity to plunge into the past and see the heroes and villains they have loved for a long time, literally breathing new life into long-familiar images. All this made it possible to earn an excellent box office, prepare the ground for future projects about Spider-Man, and, most importantly, reminded and even taught young viewers important things. It is necessary to be responsible for every adult independent decision. Take it on your shoulders, learn from mistakes and understand that every person has them, even if it's Spider-Man.After all, ""the greater the power, the greater the responsibility.""8 out of 10.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Squirrel_the_Grip_1","19 December 2021","I highly enjoyed Spider-Man: No Way Home. It was a great culmination of all three properties of the Spider-Man franchise blending Sam Raimi's Spider-Man universe, along with Marc Webb's Spider-Man universe, into the Marvel Cinematic Universe into Marvels famed ""Multiverse"". My only real quarrel with the film was that it spent too much time re-introducing the characters we already knew from previous movies and now timelines. All the character performances were superb and endearing.","10/10"

If you like seeing all the enemies of Spider- Man come together in one film, then you will not be disappointed, but though Tom Holland has been a decent Peter Parker I am not sure where this franchise can go now with regards to making classy sequels and I for one will not be in a hurry to see it.","3/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Aaron1375","26 December 2021","I believe the last film I watched at the theater was that Lion King remake, but before that it was Spider-man Far From Home. I used to go to the movies all the time, but due to the whole pandemic thing I have not gone in a long while and add to that crippling depression making going out for me a very difficult task. That being said, I am a huge Spider-man fan and I have seen all the Spider-man films in the theater so I managed to get out of the house for my off day from work rather than just staying in bed all day. I was rewarded with a very good film, full of action and nostalgia; however, that being said due to my state of mind it also made me severely sad and a bit suicidal. Just hard for me these days to fully enjoy anything with me growing older and life becoming a pointless endeavor. Still, I enjoyed seeing the old villains, especially Dr. Octopus as he is my favorite Spider-man villain from the comics.The story, Mysterio's message at the end of Far From Home has Peter hounded by the press, taken in by agents and ruins his and his friends MJ and Ned's chances of getting into MIT. So Spider-man goes to Dr. Strange's place where he asks if there is anything the good sorcerer can do. Dr. Strange says he can make everyone forget Spidey's identity, but while in the middle of casting, Spider-man keeps adding stipulations causing the spell to go out of control. Soon enemies of Spider-man from the multiverse emerge and Spider-man must round them up so that they can be sent back; however, our hero soon learns that they are going to die and he wishes to help him despite Dr. Strange's protests. Soon Spider-man finds himself in the need of help as things get there darkest and he finds two other allies to help set things on the correct course.The film is good, but it definitely did not help my depression one bit. Watching the scene where MJ was rescued almost had me burst into tears, as I remembered the scene from one of the other films and remembered my fiance who has since passed away was with me during this time. I also felt alone as Peter was and feel a sense of hopelessness as my life has no meaning, so while a good movie, it probably can hurt someone who is struggling with bad depression as I am. I was honestly hoping for a more happy type film to make me feel a bit cheered up more than one that made me go further down...So a great film, one of the better MCU films and my favorite of Tom Holland's Spider-man films. I honestly, though, would love to see Garfield return to the role for maybe another Amazing film as it was good seeing him as Spider-man again and it would be nice to see some closure for his Spider-man. Heck, I would not mind another Tobey one either as that series never did have full closure either! That one is probably less likely due to Tobey's age though. I will say my only real complaint of the film is the lack of a new villain, this being due to the fact Spider-man has a whole gallery of villains so having a new one would have been easy and would have given the film six Spidey foes making them sort of a Sinister Six! That would have been cool, but still an amazing film all the same.","1/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","nsmiaroski","14 March 2022","I had no idea what to expect from this movie. The couple reviews I heard had only mentioned that No Way Home was ""surprising"". I was ready to be disappointed to say the least. However I quite enjoyed it. For awhile many people have wondered how the individual spider man movies fit into the same narrative and how they conceptualized it was impressive. Not to mention the fact that they were able to get the original actors from the other spider man movies.. Absolutely loved the banter between the spider men and the loyalty they had for their own story within their respective universe. I also liked the set up for continuation with another Doctor Strange movie. I hope we can see more of him in the future.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kemal-44877","4 February 2022","VFX and sound is awesome as always. However, the story is forgettable and hard to relate. Peter is very annoying for the whole first act and although he's there for the second and third act, somehow his presence disappears. I watched it on IMAX just to see if I'd enjoy it fully, but nope. I'd prefer Eternals over this one. There are some emotional moments that are nicely done. You feel the heartbreak for sure. Some moments on the other hand feels fake. Dr. Octopus talks too much that he becomes annoying as well. And I'll never understand why Peter lets them all out from the prison at once.","5/10"

And his two best friends couldn't act to save their own skin. Frankly, the movie wouldn't have survived more than 4 stars if not for Tobey and Garfield's presence. The whole plot was a flop to be honest, I can't understand why they would even go for it. I mean the idea was great but the execution was terrible esp the introduction of the two spideys. And how in the world did Spidey outsmart Dr Strange in his own world, but he couldn't handle a mere human like Green Goblin?! And he was able to scoop up MJ and make a run for it but he couldn't pick up Aunt May and rush her to the hospital? Absolutely childish. Don't believe all the amazing reviews, they are just diehard marvel fans.Question, do different people write the scripts for each Spidey because Garfield's lines are the best.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","nightcrawler-01053","29 January 2023","Given the second film I should've known better, but I wanted to give No Way Home a chance in the hope Dr. Strange could save it from the mediocrity that was Jake Gyllenhall as Mysterio. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.This film is so inconsistent with its tone it's honestly laughable. Peter Parker botches Strange's spell multiple times whilst he's mid-casting it even though Strange tells him not to? Since when did Strange become stupider than a 17 year old kid.Spider-Man then defeats Strange in his own dimension using geometry based maths... Um, what?Aunt May dies and then in the lab MJ asks Peter if he's okay and his immediate response is ""Yeah, I'm fine."" Um, what? Aside from the tonal inconsistencies it really is nothing more than yet another Marvel/Disney CGI borefest; where nothing that happens involving any of the villains is remotely believable as far as suspension of disbelief goes.All the incidental characters just behave and act as though everything's normal and fine and they haven't just been through or seen the most traumatic experience of their entire lives. It's all so utterly fake and inconsequential.Unfortunately, this is just like every other copy and paste Marvel movie that fails to engage its audience with characters that actually have emotional depth. As it stands, No Way Home is a soulless, vacuous slog that entertains to some degree, but doesn't show anything that comes close to being meaningful.","8/10"

It is the perfect place and perfect way for tom Holland's web slinger to part ways from MCU and head off to sony and homestly no jard feelings there.

It was a great movie and when those two other Spider-Man came out my theatre ereputed with cheers and I have never seen so many people cheer or shout since Avengers Endgame and it was amazing. This movie was definitely the best Spider-Man movie they have made and definitely beats the other two Tom Holland Spider-Man films. I do wish we would have seen them mention the name ""Sinsister Six"" as if you know the comics you would know what that means but it was nice too see villains from all three franchises just wish we would have saw more and more dialogue with them and there Spider-Man's. Side note would have been a 10/10 if they put more Daredevil in the movie more and not just one scene but overall 8/10. Overall great movie just need some minor changes.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","fciocca","28 September 2022","""No Way Home"" is an ambitious project that tries to unite Spider-Man fans of different generations and I have appreciated this effort. I am not against fan-service movies, as long as the plot is interesting and well developed. It is a film that overwelcome its staying, with a length of almost two hours and a half. I had to split the viewing on two different days, because I was getting really bored. There are tons of scenes that needed to be cut, as some plot points are completely useless. The premises are ridiculous: basically all the mess happening in the film is due to some Peter's whim. Therefore all the fights that we see against the villains were perfectly avoidable, if only Doctor Strange was a bit more responsible and would just clarify with Parker his intentions, before executing the spell. It baffles me that such a powerful sorcerer commits these mistakes, it does not make any sense.It is enjoyable seeing three different Spider-Men generations united in one great movie with their respective enemies to fight. However due to the excessive length, this meeting between Parkers came way too late, when my attention span was already really, really low. There are a few good moments between them, but there are many cringey jokes, worth probably of a preteen audience. Dialogues are cheesy and annoying. It is sad that screenwriters could not come with something a bit more creative and well thought out, especially considering that this was the big reunion that a lot of fans were waiting for a long time. It is a disappointing result that does not really add anything new to the big cinematic universe: once again the multiverse is mentioned, and finally we start to see a glimpse of some consequences of this topic on the MCU, but it is not enough, especially for a two hours and a half movie. If you are a die hard fan, maybe you will enjoy this movie more than I did. For me it was a wasted opportunity to do something really great.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","rgkarim","17 December 2021","LIKES:The Special Effects:
Disney's resources can be used to craft amazing pieces, and No Way Home shows just how much of the good stuff they have when they put their time and money to it. Spiderman's dive into the multiverse is beautiful on almost all fronts in both design and animation. Dazzling displays of light, color, flashing, and explosions are blended together to make exciting, comic book feeling moments, all while getting hit with darker layers as the fight progresses. Spiderman facing the various villains seen in the trailer are fantastic, as web slinging, dodging, and various blasting occurs to rock the screen with amazing, theater rumbling effects. It's a very cinema worthy movie for this alone, but there is so much more to it.The Comedy:
Disney is all about cramming the jokes into the movie to lighten things up, and sometimes they take it too far. Fortunately, No Way Home manages to keep the comedy in check, timing things at the opportune moments and hitting running gags to keep us ingrained in the MCU Spiderverse. The banter was mostly kept in check, each of the characters styles blended well together with awesome chemistry, and even better it was not too much to trip up the emotional moments this movie has, which is a fantastic balance for this reviewer.The Action:
For the most part, the fights and chases in this movie feel very much like something from the Marvel comic universe. Taking that classic Spiderman taunting, while implementing strategy, agility, and use of environment, led to some decent moments that were suspenseful and interesting to see what damage would be caused. As the movie's tone changed, the nature of the fights changed too to keep pace, and by the end it was an amazing blend of comedic, action, and emotion to paint a near perfect finale for me.The Acting:
Again, Marvel casted well in this movie and opens up so many great chemistry networks between the characters that were in this movie. Holland is still a wonderful blend of Peter Parker and Spiderman, who has taken the character again to further heights and pulls the character through the ringer. This movie puts the main character into the ringer and Holland does things so well to really grab that emotion and pull at your heart strings. Zendaya's quality still shines through, and her rendition of M. J. still holds the same core foundation, but starts to further evolve and grow the seeds planted at the end of Far From Home. Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is top notch as usual, he's fun, he's classy, and he really sets the stage for the future of the character in this bizarre multiverse being set up and is exciting to see this transition layering more onto the character. Jacob Betalon as Ned again rocks in the comedy moment, but also extends to some other moments that were again perfect for the story. Alfred Molena, reprises the role of Doc Oc super well, bringing the same narcissism intellect of the character, but diving back into the complexity of the character we had in the second movie. There are so many more to compliment, but I can't due to potential for spoilers, but rest assure that the chemistry between this cast is a mixture of quality.Handling the Characters Well:
Spiderman: No Way Home had a lot of balls to juggle and for me, they did it quite well with the material they had to present. Extending the story from the end of the last movie, while mixing in Strange felt very natural, with adequate time spent listing out the problems and solutions the two ""Avengers"" had to find for the spell that went wrong. And once that door was opened, the complexity of the story required a lot more planning and direction. Watts and the team succeeded, managing to keep a lot of characters in the mix and making sure their inclusion was meaningful past the simple marketing for toys. Even the villains get some decent balance, again bringing their own interactions and plot components that for the most part were not forced or counteractive. It was a fantastic display of coordination and effort and given the potential disaster this could have been, I'm very much happy with the results.The Emotional Heart:
These movies and characters mean the world to the fans, and that means crossing into the heartstring pulling territory. No Way Home hits this several times, and I loved the moral testing components that they wrote in here for so many characters. Diving deeper into these characters, we got past the simple good-guy vs. Bad-guy motif and instead got something much bigger that again justified the inclusion of so many things. This is certainly one of the clutch moments of the MCU and I dare say it was something that sets so much up for the rest of the wave.DISLIKES:Pacing at the beginning:
It's all about the set up and making sure we are ready for everything to happen in the movie. As such, that was the part of the movie that I found to be a little drawn out and boring at times for me. I don't know if I was just tired, or I was hoping for a little more movement or suspense and it took about the first thirty minutes before the first fight really kicked in. Once that happened, the pacing issues were very minor at that point, only going a bit fast a few times in how some of the twists were brought in.The Computer work at times:
As much as I enjoyed the special effects and CGI, I can't say that it was flawless. No Way Home does have moments where the computer look reared its head and took shortcuts into the less realistic looking realm. The very artificial movements, the digital look to the skin, and a few other moments did drop into the lower resolution. Again, a minor flaw for me, but something I have seen in the past get fans upset.The Action at Times:
There are times where the fighting really started to ramp up, finding a great pace and stride that was gearing up for a great Spiderman brawl. However, the action would then trip and lose that momentum with an abrupt ending. There were great moments where they achieved all those incredible fighting sequences, but there were times I would have liked a little more coordination and magic that we had with other films, especially at the end with the way they were solving some problems. It feels like they were running out of time and some cuts were made to offset the full coordination, but again this is still a nitpick moment for picking on to find the answer.Some of the Bad Guys Needed A Little More:
Doc Oc as I said earlier was a fantastic villain they did so much with and Green Goblin as well has the bite that feels like an extension of the classic character. However, the Lizard and Sandman (which have been seen in the trailers), felt a little more time was needed to further expand upon their characters more and give them the same bite they held long ago. I know the reasons they were brought in for the most part, but... there still could have been some more fun with them to help get a little more mojo and time with them would have been amazing.Predictable:
I got most of the twists they were trying to surprise us with. Lots of foreshadowing handed you the keys to getting the big events that were going to happen and how they were going to help repair the mess they were looking. I can't say that the call of things being a surprise were really a surprise. However, this minor dislike still does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie for me.The VERDICT:
Spiderman No Way Home achieved a lot of greatness for this reviewer and makes me feel a little more comfortable from what is coming out of Marvel in the future. It's a fun movie that has so much to it and really brings forth an amazing experience meant for viewing in the theater. It's exciting, it's got heart, it's got comedy, and it keeps many things in the air with a balanced manner that was certainly exceeding the expectations that I had going in. No Way Home shows the multiverse may be in good hands and if they can continue this art of balance of new ideas and foundations, then we are in good hands. Sure, there are some pacing issues at time, some simplified solution finding, and a few characters needing a little more time. However, overall, this film is in the top Spiderman movies and I strongly encourage you to see it in the theater if you can find the time.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5.","1/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","melwinbauer","15 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home is the latest blockbuster to arrive from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Spider-man's identity is revealed to be Peter Parker, whose life gets turned upside down, and he is faced with his greatest challenge yet.No Way Home is a great superhero film filled with amazing action, heart-wrenching emotional scenes, and incredible surprises. If you have watched Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame you will see many similarities. Both in the sheer scope of the film and in the epic nature in which it unfolds. In my theater the audience erupted several times, cheering and applauding.The action is hard-hitting and significantly more violent than previous Spider-Man movies from Marvel which adds something new and great to this film. The story is also great which both makes for an amazing movie and it paves the way for plenty of great movies to come. The movie also features the best performance from Tom Holland yet. He is finally coming into his own as Spider-Man and it is honestly amazing to see.Go see this movie immediately. Do your best not to get spoiled and see it in the cinema. You won't be disappointed. Spider-Man: No Way Home is the greatest Spider-Man movie I've ever seen and one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen as well. Overall a great film and I can't wait to see where the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes next.","2/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","neil-476","22 December 2021","Peter Parker, outed as Spider-Man, and framed for Mysterio's death (see previous film), asks Dr Strange to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. But things go horribly wrong, and the multiverse suddenly gets very real indeed.The trailer reveals the Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 makes an appearance, thus linking the MCU with the original Spider-Man franchise, but it is worth watching all 5 pre-MCU movies beforehand because there are moments here which payoff all those movies.This is a very good movie notwithstanding the fan service. It's a good story, the action and effects are first rate, the performances are excellent, and there is a lot of emotion. Far From Home was very good, albeit a more intimate movie after the cosmic goings-on in Infinity War and Endgame, but No Way Home makes it clear that Phase 4 will be as capable of weaving intimate personal issues and massive threats as Phase 3 was.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","omgajjar-00698","8 March 2022","This movie can be said as one of the best film in the world. I mean like 'What a time to be alive!' for the fans of Spider-Man who grew up watching all the Spider-Man films in the cinema. It was a masterpiece combination of all Spider-Man films.When Doc. Otto Octavius first appeared in the movie and asked Spider-Man about his Machine of the power of sun, I was speechless and moreover, all the actors who played the role of villains of past Spider-Man films were still looking fit like they looked in the past films of Spider-Man.Another moment when I was speechless was when Andrew and Tobey showed up in the movie. Some of the scenes of three of them were quite entertaining like when they were talking about the villains they have fought and referring to all past Spider-Man films which gave me Nostalgic feeling of my childhood.The direction work done by Jon Watts was amazing but there was not much in the story plot when we compare it with Far From Home or EndGame, but still it was entertaining.This movie made the audience laugh, cry, feel angry, shock, feel nostalgic and much more so overall this movie is one of the best film ever made on the Earth.*BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY ELECTRO (MAX) WAS IN THE FILM AS HE DIDN'T KNEW THAT PETER PARKER IS SPIDER-MAN?*They should have been cast Dane DeHaan in the place of Jamie Fox as Harry Osborn (Green Goblin) knew that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.(Still saying it again) This film was totally entertaining for all Spider-Man fans!","8/10"

I don't even know what to say barely left the theater before I started to write this both Tobey and Andrew back. (sorry Nicholas Hammond maybe next time). If you love any of the 2 previous versions you will most likely love this movie since there are a bunch of references and actors from those are returning back. Peter Parker also have good character growth at the end of the movie he doesn't feel like a kid anymore. He feel a lot mroe mature and finally is standing on his own legs.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","vipham941","23 December 2021","I'll be honest, I was going this expecting the hype around the film to exceed its quality but it was delightfully surprising.Despite knowing the biggest and most exciting twist of the film (thanks internet), the film managed to surprise and deliver.With the absolute stand out performance of Tom Holland as Spider-Man and the surprise appearance of a few familiar faces, the film delivers in an action packed yet still emotionally powerful way quickly and easily becoming the best of the MCU's Spider-Man movies.The only real criticism I have of this film is it's reliance on past characters and films to carry the narrative of the film. Rather than coming up with new ideas for Spider-Man and the future of his character in the MCU, they chose to rehash old favourites. Whilst I understand that to a certain extent, it is a little disappointing to see so much of the film hinge on it.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","imiea","16 December 2021","""Where do we go from here?"" is the biggest question I have after leaving the cinema. The possibilities are endless both for Spiderman and the MCU as a whole.Firstly, this movie absolutely delivers on so many levels. So often, the hype for a film could leave you disappointed but not this one. Fan service is at the very core of No Way Home but at the same time it ties in beautifully to what we're seeing with this new phase of MCU projects.With all the craziness, epic moments, secrets and reveals, I was worried this movie will take the attention away from Tom Holland's Spiderman but if anything it just adds to his story arch and sets up an amazing potential future for the character. I honestly can't wait to see what comes next for Spiderman and Peter Parker. Holland does a fantastic job and we really get to see just how good of an actor he is in this movie. No Way Home is filled with fantastic visuals and plenty of emotion, and in classic MCU style, thrilling action, your usual one liners and (not always, but definitely in this film) a storyline that keeps the Marvel steam train running at full force.There are many scenes in this film that will leave long time Spidey fans feeling like a kid again and is exactly what you'd expect it to be. The feeling of joy, nostalgia, excitement and to some extent, relief, was truly magical and I'm forever grateful to have experienced it. It would be extremely difficult to ever witness something like this on the big screen again. Thank you Marvel, and thank you Sony.In my opinion, there are some areas in the film 's storyline where it suffers a bit. Some of the character's decisions are a bit Strange (no pun intended) in parts with certain events being questionable. But then again, that's the tricky part with these films. It's science fiction and you can never read too much into the details. Sometimes its best to just accept it for what it is, which in this case, is an epic superhero adventure.Despite the VERY minor questionable plot details, No Way Home is undoubtedly a phenomenal film that will go down as one of the greatest superhero films of all time. It is a true love letter to Spiderman fans and an event that will surely open up a multitude of possibilities for the MCU.","8/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jdowney-57-371157","10 May 2022","I am pretty stunned that this movie is as popular as it is. It's basically a contrived gimmick to pull together the characters from past Spidey incarnations and crack a lot of jokes.I have never been a fan of Tom Holland's take on Spiderman as a good hearted teen-ager being overly deferential to every adult he deals with. It's a one-note performance and from the start it's been contrived and unconvincing. Andrew Garfield relied on looking at the ground and foot-shuffling when he was trying to portray Spiderman. Holland just calls everyone 'Sir' all the time.So...in a stupid corny contrived scene, Spiderman can't shut up long enough to allow Dr. Strange to cast a spell and everything is set in motion. Dimensional reality is breached and the other Spider Men from other Universes wind up in the new Spider Man's reality. So do all the old baddies from the old movies. Doc Occ/Goblin/SandMan/Electro/Lizard Man. So the three Spideys + Zendaya and her giant nose and Spider's Nerd Pal join together to correct the histories of multiple universes and they succeed but at a huge cost.There is a ton of 'jokey' humour in this junk food burger that doesn't work. There are standard Marvel CGI effects. There are a strangely bunch of complacent half-hearted no motivation baddies.The whole thing is horribly contrived, doesn't make sense, the characters don't act in sensible fashion, and our Hero is left with nothing but his super-hero identity....which we are left with the idea that that is all he needs because it is his destiny.Plot wise this movie was as bad as The Eternals. It is basically a movie for kids I guess. Fundamentally it was simple, stupid, contrived. Like a Big Mac, it filled you up, left you sluggish and wishing you had eaten something of better quality.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kgprophet","18 December 2021","While this third movie in the latest trilogy of Spiderman films will more than placate the fanboys and fangirls out there, it is at a cost. This movie could have easily clocked in at two hours and feel like the perfect blockbuster movie. But no. After the finale, the ""good byes"" stretch on and on. Then of course there is baiting for other upcoming MCU movies. Even the fun jokey jokey scenes that are the hallmark of this franchise get cringe-worthy sometimes. I still give this movie a thumbs up, because it took a concept and found some fun with it. There is a little bit of manipulation, with more than a few tear jerker scenes (really? How many times do you need to push the waterworks?). But the biggest thing this movie has going for it is re-thinking the villains. Instead of the villains arriving and being bad guys, we find a way to make them sympathetic, and the audience will go along with the alternate storyline.I also like Benedict Cumberbatch. He fares well as a secondary character that only appears in the movie every once in a while. At the heart of the success of this current iteration of the Spiderman franchise is the friendship, particularly MJ and Ned. They stay integral to the center of the story quite intentionally, so you feel this is more of an ensemble piece that the previous two movies. However, the expected fan service (rumors are true) takes over and becomes the twist in the story. The concept of multiple universes has been pushed by Marvel for the last couple years, and here it is used as a vehicle for conflicts that arise.So I enjoyed the story, the treatment of the villains, plus the high buck action scenes we expect, and the supporting characters. For that reason, I will declare this film is the best of the three. Just get ready for some tugs at the heart in the third act, where you may find yourself getting a little annoyed that another music cue (the solitary piano notes with the sad violin) is making you well up again.I will give this a 7 out of 10, despite the extra half-hour of hugging.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Dello_","17 December 2021","On the surface Spider-Man: No Way Home is highly entertaining, funny and with some heartfelt moments and all contributes to a satisfying view. It is great too see again some old villains and in general there is a lot of fan service but is done well and it's not annoying. The movie is also able to trigger people reactions and if you watch this movie in a passionate theatre the experience will be great because you can hear the sounds of the people around you, and it was something that I didn't experience since the pandemic has started and it was nice. You'll probably walk out from the viewing with very positive vibes and with high levels of satisfaction. BUT if you start think about it with a more critical view the magic will vanish because nothing makes sense. The premise is so stupid and the movie happens because Peter had suddenly become retarded, and not only him. Things happen because we will never know (like the reason for the return of the villains, the movie tries to give an explanation but in reality doesn't). And realistically what is the probability that between an infinite number of universes could happen exactly what has happened in the movie? How fortunate we were! And also the finale (that is very very satisfying and emotional) comes from a sudden change of the rules established previously in the movie. And so you can see that everything is only a pretext to please fans but without a real structure or a good premise behind it. The plot is useful only for the fan service. And if on one hand it is what has made my watching an experience, it is something that has to be noted. And so I am divided between my fan nature that has liked this movie and my rational and objective nature that dislikes it because of the nonsense of the plot. And so in conclusion what I can say is: go watch it for the experience without expecting a good movie, only a collection of cool scenes.","8/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","guskeller","17 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home is clever fan service. The usual MCU self-references are present, but No Way Home takes a step further, acknowledging previous Spider-Man eras as its central story. Turning references into legitimate plot points deserves credit. Furthermore, the cast is truly stunning and the main selling point here. The film successfully brings all these eras together and gives everyone time to shine. Naturally, this all helps the acting too because the excellent cast clearly enjoys their roles. Add in the patented MCU filmmaking baseline, and the result is a surefire hit.However, No Way Home's gimmicks do not make a masterpiece. On a technical level, the film is still basic MCU. Occasionally, there is abstract sound and visual craft, but those aspects are mostly standard. The same goes for the editing, music, and production, which all meet (but rarely elevate) the material. Lastly, the writing and direction both get lost in the massive shuffle. This is the most epic MCU Spider-Man, and, unfortunately, the least heartfelt. The tone isn't focused and the emotional beats aren't earned. The attempts are decent, but don't resonate amongst the excitement. Nevertheless, No Way Home is certainly everything the fanboys want.Writing: 6/10

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","gbomb-47688","2 March 2022","I liked this movie quiet a lot I went to the cinema to watch it with my friends the night it was released it's a solid movie. Green goblin is easily the best part of this movie his character is brilliant and menacing. The rest of the villains were also pretty good a part from the lizard who didn't really have anything to do. Tobey and Andrew coming back was also great and it was good to see 3 generations of Spider-Man coming together. A few issues I have with this movie is one the death of ant may was very predictable and a bit underwhelming I believe it would of been better if Tobey Spider-Man had died but that's just my opinion.","8/10"

Many heartfelt scenes and comedy that hit for the most part makes this among my favorite Spider man movies.","5/10"

Now please be quiet so that we can actually hear the dialogue. Yes, everyone here is a Marvel fan; the characters on the screen can't hear you. Chances are no one involved in the filmmaking process is here in this screening so there is no need to clap and applause.A hefty amount of nostalgia bait, some crippling plot holes and inexplicable character choices make up what is the best Spider-Man 3.Should have brought back the Aunt May from the Rami trilogy. We needed another monologue about heroism.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","haleygalea","23 February 2022","As a long time Marvel and Spider-Man fan, this movie completed my childhood. Watching Maguire's, Garfield's and Holland's Spider-Mans come together created the most perfect Marvel movie to exist (thus far). It involves the most exceptional combination of comic relief scenes (mainly involving all three Spider-men) which created light-hearted moments and in contrast, melancholic scenes which bring you to tears (more than you already will be).","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","unpopicakbill","16 March 2022","Yet another Marvel movie, garbage-in garbage-out category. Trying to be both inventive, and still relying on good characters vs bad characters, and if one changes, it does from good to bad or vice-versa, but having no human emotion. So this feels like scripted by an AI of Apple, studying 5-year olds.All this being said, one will watch it nonetheless, because it is over rated, to the point it made it to top 250. But on the way our it will end it in the Marvel pile of movies, where it rates as about as average, maybe an inch above.So for me these movies rank as 4/10, with these new copycat at 5/10. In my view, don't bother, but one cannot be really stopped in wasting 2.5hrs of their life that easy!","9/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","notareviewer","19 December 2021","I'm not going to lie, having heard so many great things about this film made me a little dissapointed during the first hour of this film. Sure, it was enjoyable but I was expecting something spectacular waiting anxiously on the edge of my seat. But, in the end i was so far from dissapointed. This movie truly has everything a good ""superhero"" movie can have. Lots of great friendship and love scenes, fight scenes and those really, really intense scenes. But the thing that makes this movie stand out the most is because spiderman carries the sense of humanity. This movie made me cry, laugh, irritated and even a little bit angry sometimes and that's what makes it so great. The emotions made it the best spiderman movie so far. One moment that really made me cry was when Garfield (spiderman 3) catches MJ, not wanting Holland (spiderman 1) to feel the same sorrow he felt for Gwen. I also feel like you get the most out of this movie if you've watched all of the spiderman movies made, it gets you really sentimental.If you haven't seen this movie yet then you really have to as soon as you can, one of the best movies i've seen this year.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","smoesman","15 March 2022","I won't spoil anything, but this story is very smart and balanced. It's funny, dramatic and full of spectacular action.

Simply a great ride! Coming from a guy that collected spiderman comics around in 1970.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","sebastianschlicht","7 March 2022","There you go, Marvel, it's possible! After ""Avengers Endgame"" the quality of most MCU films was extremely disappointing in my eyes. Neither films nor series could really convince me. But my last hope rested on the third and (for now?) last ""Spider-Man"" film with Tom Holland. And who would have thought it, but ""No Way Home"" (2021) made it! The film refreshed the MCU and in my opinion is the best thing Marvel has done in a long time in so many ways. But where do you start with this film? Difficult, because it's hard to tell anything about the story without spoilers, so I'll go into spoilers later, but of course point them out first.Peter's identity was revealed by Mysterio and now he has to live with the consequences. His personal life is over, but so are his friends MJ and Ned. And if that wasn't enough, many people believe that Peter killed Mysterio. Spidey sees no alternative but to seek out Doctor Strange. Because he might have a solution for his problem...It's almost impossible to go into the film without any prior knowledge, because the trailers alone tell you very clearly what to expect. But of course they don't reveal everything, which I at least welcome. Still, I recommend anyone who hasn't seen the trailer (if thats even an option for anyone) to avoid it and go into the movie as fresh as possible.""No Way Home"" is the third film in this still quite young trilogy, which actually doesn't really work without the ""Avengers"" films (and many other individual films from the MCU), but you can say that we all have a real, complete Spider-Man series for the first time. Both the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield films ended quite openly. And while Tom Holland will certainly continue, this film is a kind of conclusion for the Avengers-Spidey.The story in this film takes on unexpected dimensions and for a long time I had the feeling that there were real stakes. I noticed that especially with the action. A lot of Marvel movies have those clearly defined action moments that are meant to look cool and epic (so you can put them into the trailers), but here the Peter Parker story came first. Each scene seemed like a natural progression from the one before, and I really liked that. I also think it's great that Tom Holland's character has to face the biggest challenges since Thanos. It's his film and his story. And it has never been as good as it is here. Holland is a great actor who has been fantastic as Spider-Man so far, but it's only here that I think he really matures into a character. The rest of the cast is great too, I really like Zendaya and Jacob Batalon in this film and they also develop into fleshed out characters.But that's not all: The action and the visuals of the film have improved. While technically good, the first two Spidey films were never as impressive as Sam Raimi's trio. Here, however, some people seem to have really thought about it. ""No Way Home"" is visually very impressive, wild and at times beautiful. Michael Giacchino (again) does a great job with his score and lets the Spidey theme sound really powerful with a few moments of goosebumps.The film isn't quite perfect, as many logic gaps are opened up in order to advance the story. BUT: That never bothered me because the fun, the emotions and the huge surprises were more than worth it. A movie has to entertain me and ""No Way Home"" did that every second. And that's exactly why I forgive the film's small weaknesses. Also, in an MCU film with magic and spider powers, you have to accept some supernatural and crazy things.But from here I have to enter spoiler territory. So if you haven't seen the film yet, you should NOT read on and jump to the conclusion. Here's your warning, so go ahead!SPOILER Alert!It was clear from the trailers that there would be an overlap with the previous Spidey universes. But even before that, there was speculation, fantasizing and there were first leaks. I think that's why everyone wanted to see this film. But despite all the fantastic appearances, ""No Way Home"" is still a film that not only does (great) fan service, but creates a new story with old characters. Especially the villains from the Raimi and Marc Webb universe refresh the whole thing nicely. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe as Osborne are the stars here, but Jamie Foxx as Electro also gets a new take on his character. Sandman and the Lizard are there and the actors (Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans) give their voice for them, but the ending shots with the actors were (unfortunately) used from earlier films. At least we get to enjoy J. K. Simmons again as J. Jonah Jameson. This time he is a paranoid maniac who spreads consiracy theories, but it works.In addition, the idea that all villains should be healed is really great. No typical good versus evil, but Holland's Peter Parker wants to give these antagonists a new chance. At the same time, however, he is also struggling with the consequences of his leaked identity.But what would this film be without the appearances of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield? How much I wished for that and it came true. And both aren't just simple cameos, they both have integral roles in the story. And this is where the magic of the film comes into play. Something like this will probably never happen again, it's unique. And I never thought that Marvel could make me feel this overflowing enthusiasm again, like last time in ""Endgame"". Seeing Tobey Maguire again as Spider-Man was magical. And Garfield gets to save MJ in free fall, bringing some closure to his trauma with Gwen. Absolutely fantastic!The question is, of course, is it possible to see and enjoy the film without the Maguire and Garfield films? Yes. But of course the effect without these films isn't even remotely as great. And honestly, what Spidey fan hasn't seen the other movies? There's even a small, funny reference to Miles Moralis.SPOILERS end!Conclusion: What a movie. What a Spider-Man movie. ""No Way Home"" was the most fun I had in the cinema since ""Endgame"". Marvel still has this magical potential somehow and director Jon Watts got almost everything out of this story. An absolute festival that entertained and touched me like hardly anything else in 2021!","8/10"

Whats with all of them knowing they where going to die, dd they revive? Why not at the end make people forget about Spiderman and not Peter??Don't think is very rewatchable, but had a great time.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","classicsoncall","6 January 2022","I believe this film entered IMDb's 'Top 250' at number #9, briefly rose to #8, and has now settled down into the 17th spot as I write this, right between ""The Matrix"" and ""Goodfellas"". I go on this little rant every time a new comic book super-hero movie comes out, because in anyone's wildest imagination, this cannot possibly be the 17th best movie of all time. Not that it will stay there as time goes by, but it just boggles my mind how a movie's audience and IMDb voters can impact a film's standing when it first comes out. Anyway, enough of that.For me, I thought the picture was quite a fun and entertaining experience. The idea of the two former Spider-Man actors returning to the big screen to help out Tom Holland's current depiction of the character was just a marvelous touch. Combined with many of the past Spidey villains and that quick cameo by Charlie Cox as Attorney Matt Murdoch made this an exciting and unexpected pleasure. Anywhere else the whole multiverse concept could have been a huge bungle, but the screenwriters here did a competent job of melding the disparate universes into a cohesive story that didn't seem far fetched within the context of Spider-Man's comic book history.With over four thousand reviews already posted here for this movie, there's not a whole lot I'm able to add to the discussion. Just know that if you go see this movie, it will quite likely exceed your expectations via creative story telling and superb visual effects. In other words, it's what you go to the theater for.","2/10"

They knew exactly what the fans wanted and likewise expected; and No Way Home delivers beyond the enormous hype. Not since Captain America wielded Thor's hammer in Endgame has a cinema erupted with such joy and vivacious cheering.And never have I smiled so much: NWH is bursting with delightful chemistry, Easter eggs, truly impeccable fan service and a never ending supply of fun and emotion in equal measure, all of which helps to elevate NWH in becoming the most joyous and ambitious entry in the MCU thus far.Spider Man has truly become something of an icon; and No Way Home, if nothing else, is a jubilant celebration of Peter Parker and his alter ego, including both his comic and onscreen iterations (past and present).9.5/10.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: No Way Home","AfricanBro","21 December 2021","This first part's not about the movie itself but the experience I had which I'll now always associate with the movie now. Okay so I bought 4DX tickets and it was my first time, it's crazy man. The seat started moving around like a roller coaster, wind was blowing, when the scene was somewhere cold in the movie the cinema got cold all of a sudden, water was being sprinkled everywhere, chair was vibrating and moving all over my back. The wind and water was coming from different directions, hit me behind my ears, in my face from the from the seat infront, from the sides, under and behind my ankles. I expected it, but was still really stunned. And I got a large Pepsi which I finished in about 20min and didn't pee before the movie, which is 3hr long if you consider the cinema ads in the beginning, so halfway through I had to pee really bad and the seat was throwing me around, my bladder hurt so badüòÇ didn't want to miss a thing so I had to wait for the movie to end and people were staring at me all weird 'cause I was the only one leaving since we all wait for the post credit scenesüòÇ there are two of them.But my outtake from the movie, what stood out the most to me is Tom Halland is really good at playing sad scenes, every time I see him sad or crying I feel like I wanna cry too, the African in me doesn't allow it but I do. That Andrew Garfield scene also made me wanna cry. Spider-Man's not one of my favorite heroes but I think this is one of the best movies marvel has made so far, and I love how each of the Spider-Mans all brought back the same feeling their individual movies had back then, it was great to see. Not really a complaint but I wasn't really convinced Dr. Strange was that oblivious to the consequences of what he and Spider-Man were doing, he accepted doing the favour way too easily and didn't seem surprised when everything went haywire; and can't really blame it on the acting because Cumberbatch is astounding so I'll assume it's a ""giving thanos the time stone"" kinda situation. Unlike some MCU movies, this one didn't make the fan theories seem bonkers.The movie's quite long and takes you through different emotions, I got happy, then sad, then surprised then sad again and I think good movies should do that. Recent trend in superhero movies is to make them more comedic and I love it but thought was getting a bit too far because I think movies like Let There Be Carnage should have been much darker and gory, with a higher rating like R 18 even with the funny bits, not to say the same about Spider-Man, but i think they got the comedy-drama-action blend perfectly here. I was honestly surprised it's maintaining a 9/10 rating even after being released a couple days but it is as good as they say.","5/10"

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Laura_Ratings","14 March 2022","Definitely an amazing movie. The reunion was so special to see, it was wonderful to see the previous 2 spidermans in this movie. I really, really loved it. It proves that it is not always bad to bring back some of the elements, characters or even actors from the previous movies. It takes skill to implement old elements, treat them with respect and make them turn out great in a new movie. The fact that Andrew's Peter Parker saved this universe's MJ was a touch that must have had long-time fans (me included) grabbing for tissues.Other than that I can't wait to see the next movie. I think Tom is a great Spiderman, though all 3 of the actors are the best Spiderman, there simply isn't one who is better than the other. They all portrayed the character in amazing but different ways and it's lovely to see them together to notice their impact.Furthermore, all performances in this movie were great, I really can't think of any bad points in this movie.

"Spider-Man","jaredpahl","5 June 2016","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","10/10"
"Spider-Man","nickmesafilms","19 May 2012","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","9/10"
"Spider-Man","Smells_Like_Cheese","5 May 2002","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the characters¬Ö I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","10/10"
"Spider-Man","MaxBorg89","8 October 2005","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","Doylenf","15 December 2002","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","9/10"
"Spider-Man","Hitchcoc","28 February 2006","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","Aaron1375","2 September 2005","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","MissCzarChasm","5 May 2002","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","9/10"

"Spider-Man","TxMike","1 November 2002","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","8/10"
"Spider-Man","Sleepin_Dragon","24 December 2022","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","TheLittleSongbird","8 May 2009","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","9/10"

"Spider-Man","PedroPires90","18 December 2021","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","generationofswine","16 November 2016","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","7/10"
"Spider-Man","clydestuff","9 April 2004","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","9/10"

"Spider-Man","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","2 June 2018","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","10/10"

This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","9/10"

"Spider-Man","joetufano719","19 June 2012","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","to_kill_better","26 June 2002","Having seen the trailers for this film I have to say that I didn't walk into the cinema with high hopes. The computer effects looked badly integrated, the Green Goblin's costume looked awful and comic book adaptations usually have such painful scripting and plotting. Thankfully I was wrong on most counts (The Goblin still looks rubbish).As it turns out, this is probably the best super-hero film I've yet seen - certainly up there with Superman and Batman. People seem to automatically comment that the script and acting was bad because they expect it to be the case in these films; and indeed it usually is. But if you go into Spider-man without this prejudicial attitude you'll be pleasently suprised. The acting is generally great - there is never a time when anyone is not believable as their character and you think ""Hey, that's an actor, not Peter Parker"". The effects do look artificial but the pace of the movie means you don't have time to dwell on this and the script is fine! What do people want, Shakespearian soliloquies? That would sound incredibly out-of-place in modern day New York. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like ""friendly neighbourhood spider-man"" are fully in-keeping with the character.
The comic turns from J.J. Jameson hit the mark, the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evil-looking (and the conversation with his mirror-image was a great touch). My only gripe was with the Green Goblin's costume. Very monotone green and not very scary.All-in-all a great film that I wouldn't hesitate for a second in recommending.","9/10"

"Spider-Man","MissCzarChasm","4 May 2002","It's Finally here folks. Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man has hit the big screen. The hysteria surrounding this movie is out of this world. I saw the last showing of it with my friends because every other showing was sold out and the showing i saw was packed and filled with Spidey fans and excited movie goers alike.*POTENTIAL SPOILER* I just read this morning that Spider-Man achieved the highest opening day of all time with 41.5 million and is set to make about 100-120 million opening weekend which would make it surpass Harry Potter as the highest opening weekend of all time. *END SPOILER*. There is no doubt in my mind that this film deserves the praise it got from critics and from the reaction in my theatre this film is headed for the record books.Spider-Man is a comic book movie with heart. Yes i enjoyed Blade, another marvel adaptation, and I even enjoyed its sequel. I happened to like X-Men as well. But the one thing those movies lacked was a grounded hero which was given a firm backstory. While certain things were glanced over in those films, this picture takes time to develop its characters and by the time we reach the 45 minute mark we care about all their fates. There is a nice family storyline with Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Peter Parker. There is romance with the Peter Parker/Mary Jane relationship, and there are also family struggles with the Norman/Harry Relationship. The story takes time to develop these stories and you can since that when this script was written it was done with a lot of heart and someone who cared about making us care about the characters and their struggles.One must talk about Tobey Maguire. I was disappointed when i first heard he got the part. I didn't think he could be tough enough considering his other starring roles. I was pleasantly surprised however when i saw his performance. He brings the comic book character to life in the best way. He induces the character with enough vulnerability in the beginning when he's a nerd that we care for him, but when he discovers he has powers Maguire easily shifts into someone more confident. He balances both personna's well, without falling out of character. Considering that we can't see his face at all when the mask is on, the fact that he still can give a masked character some heart is amazing in my bookKirsten Dunst isn't just there for eye candy, as the trailer would suggest. Sure, there are several shots of her that plenty of males will enjoy but she also brings her character from the comic book into the real world. Her chemistry with Tobey Maguire is not forced but very natural. There are certain moments when she falls into total damsel in distress mode but over-all it's a pretty grounded performance.James Franco makes for a very good Harry Osborn. He brings the character's struggles from the comic book and right onto the screen. We respect him because he's Parker's only friend but at the same time he makes you feel for him because he could end up as his father. Franco is able to this well and is very impressive in a few emotional scenes.Every comic book movie needs a good villian. Batman had the joker. X-men had Magneto and the Brotherhood of Evil Muntants. Spider-Man's greatest foe in the comic was none other than the Green Goblin. He gave Spider-Man the most conflict in the comic book because of the secret that he knew about Spider-Man and the secret that Spider-Man would eventually learn about him. It was very important that they not ruin this character because he's such an important villian in the Spider-Man mythology.I'm proud to say that Willem Dafoe is quite good as both Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He makes his Norman likable yet flawed in the beginning but once he turns into the Green Goblin, that's when the fun starts. His performances is borderline over the top but since it never crosses the line he makes the villian much more threatening. You can tell he had fun with the part and while he doesn't quite reach the level of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, he's right up there as one of the better comic book movie villians. What i also enjoyed was the fact that the villian never over-shadowed the hero. This is where Batman made its mistake. Jack Nicholson stole the show, but since Dafoe doesn't get as much screentime as Tobey Maguire, he doesn't steal show. I'm glad the filmmakers chose to do this.The CGI is a wonder to look at it. You will believe that a man can stick to roles and soar over the city with grace. It's like a comic book come to life. There are some shots that look pretty unrealistic but when you think about it i think they were going for that in a couple of shots. It feels more like comic book when you see certain shots like that. Besides it would be very difficult to make this believeable with the use of a lot of CGI. The characters never lose their depth when they're in costume and the voice over work done when it's obviously not a man but a special effect is quite good as well. The actors deserves major kudos for making their characters believeable, even when it's a CGI shot.Sam Raimi is a gifted director. From genre films like the Evil Dead series, to compelling films such as A Simple Plan and The Gift, his work never ceases to amaze me. He handles the material well and you can tell he followed the comic book closely. He makes Spider-Man move much like he does in the comic book and he makes sure that there is more time spent on developing an actual story than giving us a lot of action. There is plenty of action, don't get me wrong but the story in my opinion is it's greatest highlight because you can almost identify with all of the characters. This credit should go to screenwriter, David Koepp, who also did well with the Panic Room script. Raimi does offer some campy touches. The wrestling match features a cameo with Bruce Campbell as the announcer, you may remember him as Ash from the Evil Dead movies, The towns reaction to Spider-Man is very campy and cheesy but is handled well. You can tell Raimi really had fun with the material. The J Jonah Jameson character is another example. Out of most of the supporting characters he looks more like his comic book character. The performance is doen pretty well and he does offer us some nice campy laughs.Spider-Man is more than a summer movie. Most summer movies supply you with much action but a little of everything else. This movie has it all. Action, romance, and a little heart too. The film leaves it wide open for a sequel and by the end of it i couldn't wait to go on another adventure with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN!","10/10"

"Spider-Man","zoran_kamen","18 June 2016","I truly don't know what to say about this movie, which got already all possible praises and all possible critics ! But I will write what I canfrom my heart, cause my post cannot match any reviews from grammaticalsuper humans and ultra intelligent movie critics ! OK lets start : This movie is directed by one of my favorite film directors Sam Raimi who directed and produced so many good movies and one I love the most is TV series adaptation of Evil Dead (also directed by him) movie, Ash vs Evil Dead which also have mostly positive reviews by top critics. I think ratings go well over 90% on rotten tomatoes ! Spider-Man is supremely made from beginning till end. Every scene is so fresh, playful, innocent and there is no second of boredom in this one ! I think its the best movie of all movies about Spider- Man and they surely knew why Sam Raimi would be perfect man for directing it ! Special effects are just right amount and they don't look artificial at all ! You really have feeling like being part of this world of super heroes and super villains ! So if you wanna movie to look good give it to Spielberg, Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi ! In all three cases you cannot miss ! Acting could be flawed but movie will look good ! Cause I really love movies about super heroes, with Superman first part being one of my favorite movies ever, but I love also Batman and actually all marvel produced world of super heroes, including X-men franchise (Nine movies until 2016, Deadpool is really great, as well as all others, yup I like also those three banned by critics) Why I wrote this review in 2016 if movie was made 2002 ? I always loved this movie,I guess I would like to support its ratings to go for tiny bit higher ! So for me everything is perfect in this movie - acting, effects, story, scenery for me all this is 10/10 ! On of rare movies I can say that without least doubt ! Just one more thing- 3rd part of Spider Man from 2007(also directed by Sam Raimi) was little bit over criticized by movie critics ! I know they know what to write, they are not stupid of course, but still maybe we became little to spoiled by both mega successful and genius parts before that one (2002 and 2004) cause they said ; in this 3rd part problem is there is too much of everything, but I think Sam Raimi just wanted to conclude franchise with spectacular finish, so in my eyes it was unjustly rated and my rate for all three parts is 10/10 without any doubt ! Thank You Sam for so many excellent movies and to make our life more fun !!","9/10"

Why am I so sure? Because Tobey isn't playing the shy nerd; he is really a shy nerd just like Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire played the shy, wishy-washy, Charlie Brown-like character in other important movies such as The Cider House Rules and Pleasantville and yet in all these movies he's also wise. He's the ideal next door guy , the next door superhero. I praise the performance of the other actors of this great movie of course.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","Ch4ndler_B1ng","7 January 2022","This is the OG Spider-Man movie, it has one of the greatest comic book villain performances of all time by Willem Dafoe and Tobey Maguire gives an extremely likeable portrayal of Peter Parker and Spider-Man, the face off between Green Goblin and Spidey towards the end of the film is intense and incredibly filmed, it's also the only Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie where Mary Jane isn't exceedingly whiny, annoying and just plain dislikeable. Uncle Ben's death is extremely moving and emotional, you're guaranteed to cry, his death encourages and inspires Peter Parker to become Spider Man.These three films have become memes, but the first Spider-Man movie was the start of it all, it's a classic in the superhero genre. The Green Goblin's outfit is a bit cheesy and power-ranger-y looking, some action scenes look a little unrealistic and the scene where Peter Parker is flying without his suit looks awful, but these are minor problems. And that flying scene at the end of the movie... goosebumps, amazing! It was the start of an amazing trilogy and if you disagree... ""I missed the part where that's problem.""","7/10"

"Spider-Man","classicsoncall","13 August 2011","My summary line above came from Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), spoken from her hospital bed to nephew Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) at her side. It was a great line and a cleverly playful shot at DC Comics, who haven't had as much success in adapting their super-heroes to the big screen the way Marvel Comics has. Back in 2002, this one was the 'make or break' film that would propel Marvel into future projects if it was successful, and history bears out the results. I saw the picture when it came out, but wasn't writing these reviews back then, so I'm a little late to the party. But I have to say, watching it again some nine years later leaves me with some of the same feelings I had back then. I thought the condensed story of Spider-Man's origin was neatly done, along with the way Peter gradually learned to use his new found powers. By the time Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) has his heart to heart talk with Peter and advises - ""Just be careful who you change into"" - we're already in on Peter's amazing secret with a sense that big things are ahead for the teen-age hero.One of the great kicks I get out of watching the Marvel franchise films is waiting to catch comic book writer and legend Stan Lee in one of his now ubiquitous appearances. Lee is seen in this one during the Green Goblin's attack on the Unity Day Festival when he pulls a young girl away from some falling debris. I was surprised today to see how quick that scene played out, so if you're not attentive you're bound to miss it. I see that Lee's appearance in the picture is uncredited as the 'Man in Fair', but a better clue to help pick him out would be 'Man who saves girl', but as I say, it was a pretty quick scene.The other great memory I had while watching the picture again today was the appearance of Randy 'Macho Man' Savage portraying the wrestler Bone Saw McGraw. Savage, who along with Ric Flair, was one of those pro wrestling villains that had a way of attracting a fan base because of his cool style. He displays his classic finishing move, the flying elbow drop off the top ropes on a hapless opponent before Peter enters the ring as the Human Spider. I was saddened to learn of his untimely and tragic death earlier this year, as he was a colorful character in his own right, and seemed to finally have found some measure of peace in his hectic life.Aside from the reminiscences, the picture itself is a nice balance of character development for the principal players, and action scenes involving Spider-Man and his chief nemesis, Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). I have to admit, the Goblin get-up seemed cheesy to me, looking like a static green robot, especially when the eye-guards were in place. But hey, it's over and done with, so no sense quibbling now.So overall, I thought this was a pretty good and entertaining kick start to the Marvel Universe in cinema, and certainly for your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Subsequent pictures would reinforce the idea that with great power comes great responsibility, a line that has come to epitomize the super-hero genre.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","Sean_Thorniley","1 May 2002","Poignant, fun and a  faithful adaptation to the original comic book.  I am very critical of comic book movies since I am a huge fan of the medium and was tremendously disappointed in the Superman and Batman movies (all of them, some greatly!). This film however has again demonstrated that an adaptation of a comic book story can be  fun and faithful to the story, yet be a film for all ages and those who may not have ever even read a comic book.  The Crow was the only other good comic book movie in my opinion, but it was not an all ages fun ride as this is!I had the privilege of seeing the film last night, 4-30-02, in SF with the press and 300+ other folks for its ""Bay Area Premiere"".The acting is the finest portion of the film with the leads giving us depth that I was unsure would be allowed by the style of story chosen.  Maguire was outstanding at being a guy who can rarely catch a break, but attract difficulty with ease and aplomb.  He is awkward with the woman he loves, but eloquent when dealing with the familiar, just as most teenagers are even today.  He gave us wonderful joy at the prospect of ""web swinging"" and kicking some much deserved ass!  Dafoe is wonderfully scary as the man who has succumbed to the power games of the corporate  world that drives a decent man mad striving for perfection in himself while trying to hard to please all the wrong people to no avail and then being consumed by guilt that has built over the years of family neglect which finally helps to push him over the edge when an opportunity to make a huge mistake presents itself.The rest of cast is nearly as spectacular with the J.K. Simmons turning in the best performance in the film as J. Jonah Jamason.  When he appeared on screen things lite up even more and he was on fire making everyone in the audience laugh and myself nearly p** my pants.  Harris as Aunt May and Robertson as Uncle Ben were excellent choices and gave the film a great deal of its credibility and finesse.  Letting what happens to Ben and Peter (I am not telling) was wonderful and the best punctuation to what makes Peter do what he does and brings complete credibility to the story.   I am not a huge Dunst fan, but she was just fine as the love of Peter Parker's life and a person much like Peter only neither was conscious of the fact.  This to me is a more real version of  ""true love"".The script was far stronger than I expected with some wonderful dialog; verbal exchanges, solid plot points and pacing.  Many a good parenting lesson can be found in this film as well as interesting thoughts about the choices that we make in life that we might think are no big deal when in the heat of passion, but may well come back to haunt us if we don't think before we act/speak: which is the trust of the film in my humble opinion.The direction from Raimi was also much better than I anticipated coming from someone who is known (and loved) for his over the top camp and action.  Many of the fight and action sequences where more ""over done"" than I like, but they were solid and much like a comic of the Silver Age from whence the story comes so it fit the film fine.  Nice cinematography without the CGI taking over and detracting from the realism, in fact it made much of the web swinging truly believable.  A few points made things a bit hard to ""believe"", but over all I think most folks will be able to suspend their disbelief.Danny Elfman.  Need I say more?  He is the man when it comes to ""super hero"" music and is the closest thing to John Willams and the late great Bernard Herman there is today.  He subtly sets the mood and most of the audience probably doesn't even realize it.  Tomorrow is my day off and I will be purchasing the score to add to my collection!","9/10"

I must admit that I wans't quite sure about Tobey Maguire as Peter Paker, but after watching it, I cannot think of anyone who would be better suited to the role.The only places where it changes the orginal comicbook story are when the comicbook is not very believable. So these changes don't harm the story in anyway, but might even make it better.On the whole, I would have to say this movie is definately worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of the comic/cartoon series or just a general comic fan.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","Bubba32618","18 December 2021","I love Spider-Man, the character means quite a lot to me. I have seen this film a million times but I still love it. It looks a little dated which is sad to say but still I love it and this franchise has one of the only sequels I would say is better than the original. Tobey Maguire is the best Spider-Man I think, he is such a good Peter Parker and he is a really good Spider-Man too. I do think this movie came out at the perfect time, it shows New York in a positive light with the New Yorkers helping Spider-Man, right after maybe the most tragic event ever, that happened right in New York. Willem Dafoe is very good in this film as Norman Osbourne and the Green Goblin. The way the two characters interact, because they are two characters essentially, is just really well done. Aunt May and Uncle Ben are great. Tibet's acting is pretty good. The relationship between Peter and MJ is really good and it just gets better the farther we go into these movies. James Franco is pretty good as Harry Osbourne but I think he is probably the best as Harry in Spider-Man 3. This movie has started to age a bit but I will still always love it, Spider-Man is just such a good film.","10/10"

McGuire is Spiderman/Peter Parker to me. I don't think they could have chosen better. Kirsten Dunst makes a decent Mary Jane Watson, wasn't ever fond of her to begin with, but it's pulled off well. Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin is sheer genius. The story is well written and keeps you along for the entire ride, coupled with action that's explosive and thrilling.

"Spider-Man","meydiana-65242","20 November 2020","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","10/10"
"Spider-Man","vivekchandra007","27 January 2017","Saw it again, last night, after a long time and it still managed to catch my attention and I noticed such small (intrinsic) details embedded throughout the movie that it looks like Sam Raimi really spun an amazingly entertaining movie through strings of comic-web. One of the best origin stories that like an old wine, keeps getting better because it is laden with story, a soul that only gets more enlightened by CGI. Sam Raimi researched the material well and it shows, be it having some inside jokes, Easter eggs and how he got the hero got name. The first 30 minutes is simply the best ""origin of origin"", a superhero flick has shown till date. Best thing is he got so much comfortable with it that he made even amazing second part (one of the best sequels till date) (tied up with T2) but still nothing beats an origin story because it shows ""Even you can be"".","8/10"

"Spider-Man","Aly200","21 January 2017","Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" have started getting audiences excited for the modern superhero movies, but when Sam Raimi released his first ""Spider Man"" outing the expectations bar immediately shot to the stratosphere. Raimi delivered on his promise of an exciting and action-packed film about Marvel Comic's famous web-slinging superhero. We are given the basic origin story of how teenage Peter Parker gains his famous powers after a radioactive spider bites him, but we are treated to an engaging narrative as the newly minted hero must contend with his most deadly adversary in the wicked Green Goblin while also contending with normal teenage drama such as an at-times contentious friendship as well as harboring feelings for his pretty neighbor. Stepping into the web-slinger's famous costume is the well cast Tobey Maguire who deftly manages to play both the nerdy Peter Parker and courageous Spider Man with equal flair. Despite being nearly thirty years old at the time of filming, Maguire's youthful appearance convinces the audience that he resembles a teenager and not a mature young man. Even when inhabiting Spidey's famous suit, Maguire displays a youthful machismo mixed with some naivety as Peter is still coming into his element as a superhero but proves himself as fearless when confronted by his emerald-clad nemesis, the Green Goblin. While other more seasoned young actors were considered, the gamble to go with Maguire paid handsomely as he carries the weight of both average New York teen and crime-fighting legend in harmonious tandem.On the opposite side of the board playing the villainous Green Goblin and his unstable alter ego, Norman Osbourne, is the wickedly delightful Willem Dafoe in one of his most insane roles. When the film starts and Norman is running his successful company, Dafoe portrays a fatherly wisdom for young actors Tobey Maguire as Peter and James Franco who plays Norman's son, Harry, but also shows early signs of the soon-to-be shattered psyche that will doom Norman to the corruptible power of the Goblin persona (the result of a lab accident where Norman tests a power-enhancing drug on himself and kills a fellow scientist in his mania). Once the transformation into an unstable madman begins to take effect, Dafoe fully embraces the insanity and goes as over the top as possible, utilizing his vocal talents by using a lighter vocal tone for the tormented Norman while using his trademark gravelly sounding voice and a cackling demented laugh for the wicked Goblin, without becoming a cartoonish impression of the famous super-villain but as a calculating and dangerous adversary who strikes fear into everyone around New York. Added to the excitement of watching the actor in action is that instead of having a stuntman do the brunt work of maneuvering the Goblin's glider and engaging in fisticuffs with Spider Man is that Willem Dafoe performs his own stunts (the actor himself stated the fact in numerous interviews and the filmmakers backed Dafoe's statements). A talented supporting cast rounds out the compelling characters with Kirsten Dunst as Peter Parker's longtime neighbor and love interest, Mary Jane Watson, James Franco as Peter's best friend< Harry Osbourne who happens to be the son of his mortal enemy, Rosemary Harris as Peter's beloved Aunt May and cliff Robertson in the role of Uncle Ben (who sadly doesn't make it to the halfway mark of the film as comic book fans know well) and in a scene- stealing role as hot-headed and grouchy boss of the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson, is J.K. Simmons in what is one of the character actor's most iconic roles. The film's action sequences are well choreographed and executed from Peter Parker's first attempts to use his enhanced spider-like abilities to the infamous introduction of the Green Goblin at an Oscorp party to the dynamic final confrontation between Spidey and his emerald nemesis where the fists fly and ass-kicking just draws the attention in and doesn't relent till a victor is declared. The filmmakers use as little CGI as possible except for Spider Man's web-slinging across the city since director Sam Raimi is known for using practical effects in his films. The narrative of the film as mentioned before sets up the main action with the origin of Spider Man when Peter is bitten by the radioactive spider on a field trip with his class and we are given Green Goblin's origin as well with Norman Osbourne's ill-advised test of his company's drug on himself that causes him to become the demented villain we love to hate. The story then shifts into the main plot of how Spider Man comes to learn what he must do as a hero to protect his beloved city and loved ones.A truly masterful superhero film that really ushered in the modern superhero craze.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","matitya-33937","30 August 2022","There is a grand total of one negative thing I can say about this movie and it's that the effects haven't aged well. Aside from that all of it's amazing.First off, I don't care about the fact that in the early scenes teenagers are played by grown adults, it's a common cinematic trope and honestly just a nitpick. And I'm willing to defend the biological web shooters on the grounds that a genetically engineered super-spider with the abilities of all known spiders biting Peter Parker and transmitting its powers to him through its venom should lead to him getting the ability to shoot webs rather than him having to build a machine.Now that I've gotten that out of the way. This is a great movie. Maguire does an excellent job playing Peter Parker as a bullied nerd who to some degree or another retains his social outcast status after leaving school but manages to be comfortable with himself while being Spider-Man. (Speaking of which, Peter besting Flash Thompson was a cathartic scene as it shows Peter finally fight back after being forced into a corner and delivering Flash comeuppance). Cliff Robertson does a good job acting as a wise and kind mentor figure to Peter and his murder rising from Peter's from Peter's indifference worked extremely well as a tearjerker and it rendered it possible for me to buy this as the tragedy that motivated Peter to become Spider-Man.And I love the dual character arcs of Peter Parker/Spider-Man as he goes from saying ""so stop pretending to be"" when Uncle Ben says ""I know I'm not your father"" to saying ""I had a father his name was Ben Parker"" and how he goes from being the person who says ""I missed the part where that was my problem"" to someone who says ""With great power comes great responsibility"" to the point where he rejects Mary Jane Watson for her own safety at the end of the movie even though before then his entire goal was to win her over since the beginning of the film to the point where we are able to see that he really intends to fulfill this promise even though it pains him to do so. (Unlike in The Amazing Spider-Man wherein he clearly has no intentions of fulfilling his promise at all.)I like the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde dynamic of Dr. Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin and how it makes him sympathetic without him ceasing to be a threat. Proof that you can have tridimensional villains and well-developed heroes in the same film.I liked Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson and James Franco's Harry Osborn. And how the movie manages to set the stage for a potential sequel without sacrificing a self-contained storyline.I'm going to stop here since otherwise I'll just continue raving about it non-stop. The takeaway from this is it's a really good movie.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","kosmasp","21 July 2009","I know that many regard Spider Man 2 as the best Spider Man movie to date (part 4 and 5 are on it's way, but not here yet). For me personally, Spider man does the job. It's a fun (even quite a few times dark) intro into the world of Spider Man. Tobey Maguire seems so perfect in his role, it would be a shame, if someone would replace him for future installments (even though in part 3, he seemed like a mess, I do think it was the script that let him down on that one).Of course we are talking Spider Man here and not Batman, so the Origin story is lighter and more teen/kids friendly. But having Sam Raimi at the helm of the movie, it still crosses some small boundaries. The story, the character arc, the beginning, the villain ... everything fits together. It's simple, it's fun ... and it even has Bruce Campbell in it! ;o)","7/10"
"Spider-Man","paulsipahutar","11 March 2022","This is movie I truly brilliant. The. Visual effects was very great, especially the actings,Willem Dafoe should have won the Oscar in my opinion.

"Spider-Man","mcugot","5 September 2022","Classic! It's a simple origin story that leads into a rivalry between Peter Parker/ Spider-Man and one of his most iconic foes the Green Goblin. The movie gets more intense as it goes on while also being a 50/50 spilt with Peter Parker's personal life. Very easy to follow. If you want to keep your kid busy for two hours, put this on for them, but you'll probably be just as engaged as they will be. The theme is also very recognizable. What makes Spider-Man so great is that he learns responsibility after many mistakes, which makes him relatable. The acting is great while the dialogue is cheesy, but that's what you'll get out of any early 2000 comic book movie. The cinematography is great too, but you'll probably see it improved in the 2nd and 3rd movie, at least in my opinion. It's fast paced and great and iconic scenes just keep coming one after another. The effects look good for its time but nothing mind blowing. Great sound and the score is iconic and one of the best themes for a superhero. Sam Raimi knew how to do Spider-Man right and this movie is truly one of its kind. 10/10. A+.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","giannellatonna","2 September 2022","Toby Maguire's spider-man is the best spider-man. That's a fact in my opinion but the other ones are good too,but you always have to stick to the original. That's why spider-man is one of the most popular Marvel comics.It has a story-line where the audience it's seeking, can relate to as a teenager. And the part when he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider,which is the part we just cannot relate to, but wish it would happen to us.It's an original which cannot be replaced even by spider-man 2 and spider-man 3.I cannot stop recommending this movie so much because you don't really have to watch the other Marvel movies to truly understand it.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","Mysterygeneration","21 December 2021","The film's trump card is the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, the high school geek who acquires amazing powers after being bitten by a genetically mutated spider. Kirsten Dunst is also fabulous as Mary Jane, the beautiful neighbour whom Peter secretly adores. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin is the movie's strong point, trapped behind an immobile mask and sporting a risible emerald costume.","9/10"

"Spider-Man","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","17 September 2016","It's hard to believe it's been so long since director Sam Raimi reintroduced the beloved character of Spider-Man to film-goers with one of 2002's biggest releases. It truly was a magical time, and ""Spider- Man"" was very much to thank for this. Critically lauded and adored by the public, it was not only the first film to gross over $100 million in its opening weekend, but it was also the next big step in comic- book adaptations, ushering the public closer to understanding just how important comic books were and how much potential there was to make high-quality films inspired by these modern day myths. Films like ""Blade"" and ""X-Men"" were for sure the important first steps towards this, but it was ""Spider-Man"" that delivered on this promise, with its impact still being felt to this very day thanks to the rise of franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Yes, it is hard to believe how long it's been. Heck, the movie itself would now be old enough to be in High School just like Peter were it a person.Peter Parker (Tobey Macguire) is a nerdy high school student pining after his crush Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and dodging bullies with his best friend Harry. (James Franco) However, a school trip leads Parker towards a new and heroic life when a genetically-engineered ""Super-Spider"" bites him, granting him superhuman abilities. After the tragic death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), Peter chooses to use these abilities to protect the innocent, becoming the super-hero ""Spider-Man."" However, when Harry's father Norman Osbourne (Willem Dafoe) is similarly gifted superhuman abilities in a tragic accident and becomes the dreaded supervillain ""Green Goblin"", Peter will be torn as he will be forced to combat not only the father of his best friend, but a man he has come to greatly respect.Part of the great appeal is the lush and exquisite style injected into it thanks to the playful and thoughtful direction courtesy Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp's strangely old- fashioned yet appealing writing. The duo form a perfect union to tell the tale. Raimi- at the time best known as director of low-budget horror/comedies like the wonderful ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and quirky studio projects like ""A Simple Plan""- has a unique visual voice that lent itself well to the character. Himself a fan of Spidey's earlier comic-book adventures, Raimi is perhaps one of the few directors who was truly able to paint a film that felt like a comic come to life. With his wild and exotic camera-work, a fantastic sense of scope and color, and a sense of quirky ""fun"", it's just a wonder to behold, with such a magical and whimsical feel.Koepp's script is also a great deal of fun. As I said, it has an almost old-fashioned tone. It almost feels more akin to classics like Donner's ""Superman"" or Burton's ""Batman"" in terms of structure and dialog, with everything just slightly ""off"" of feeling modern, but in an appealing way. It gives the film a sense of timelessness. It doesn't feel a product of its time... it feels like the sort of film that could have been made at any time- the 70's, 80's, 90's... even now. And it's a big part of what helps maintain the film's freshness. As much as I enjoyed the 2012 reboot, it very much was the product of its time, and I find it feels more dated than this take on the character despite being much younger a film.The cast is phenomenal, and are also a major contributor to its high quality. For many, Maguire defined the character. He nails just the right tone as Peter Parker, playing him as the sort-of archetypal underdog you can't help but root for thanks to his kind heart and depth of character. He also made for a great web-slinger, though I will admit the humor and banter was lacking. Dunst is just a lovable female lead, even when the film doesn't go out of its way to give her much development or depth. (Though this film is very much Peter's tale, so I can forgive a somewhat clich√© love interest.) Franco is a ton of fun and the seeds are planted for the future development of the character. Dafoe is just wonderful, nailing the perfect balance between flawed but good- natured father-figure and scenery-chewing madman from scene to scene. Robertson is a joy as Uncle Ben. And supporting roles like the fabulous Rosemary Harris as Aunt May are fantastic.Compounding this is an absolutely magnificent score by Danny Elfman. A legend in the field, Elfman's themes help to accentuate the visuals and lend a sense of grandiose to the proceedings. It nails the right sound of just borderline melodrama mixed with grand old majestic heroics. To this day, the opening titles still give me chills, and I still associate any depiction of Spider-Man with his themes in my mind.All of this praise being said, I can't help but admit the film has some flaws, which is where it does lose a point for me. Despite his structuring and sensibilities being great fun, Koepp's dialog is... a little too out-there. A little too manufactured, even for the quirky tone he and Raimi are going for. Some pacing problems are apparent, particularly in the first and third acts, leading to speed-up's and slow-down's that can be jarring. And even for the time, some of the effects were... sub- par. (It wasn't until about the third film that the CGI used on Spider- Man looked totally realistic.)""Spider-Man"" to this day stands among the most important superhero movies of all time. And this is thanks not only to the records it broke, or to the paths it paved for future films... but also very much for its quality and grand sense of entertainment.And it is most certainly worth a near-perfect 9 out of 10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","sdjones-1","2 May 2002","I thoroughly enjoyed ""Spider-Man,"" which I saw in a screening. I thought the movie was very engrossing.  Director Sam Raimi kept the action quotient high, but also emphasized the human element of the story.  Tobey Maguire was very believable as the gawky teenager in the early part of the film and then, after his run-in with the radioactive, genetically engineered spider, as the athletic, acrobatic superhero of the title. His boyish glee at discovering his new superpowers was infectious and got a lot of laughs.  I also didn't mind the changes to the ""Peter Parker: The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book story that the film's writers made, e.g., having Spider-Man's web come out of glands in his wrists rather than being an invention of Peter Parker's.  Especially good were Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben Parker, Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin, James Franco as Harry Osborn, and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  And in a small but memorable role, J.K. Simmons (""Oz,"" Law & Order"") as newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious.  Perfect casting. I also thought the special effects were very good.  Although I could easily tell when Spidey was a computer-generated image (or a stunt double for that matter), it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. However, I saw the movie with a six-year-old, who found the villainous Green Goblin -- superbly personified by Willem Dafoe -- very, very frightening, so I would advise against taking children younger than 10 years of age to this movie. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book was a childhood favorite of mine, and I can honestly say that Sam Raimi has done it justice!  I'm going to go see this movie again (sans terrified six-year-old).","8/10"
"Spider-Man","Movie-ManDan","22 October 2014","Before Spiderman, there wasn't very many superhero movies. Most of them sucked. After Spiderman's release in 2002 and its sequels in 2004 and 2007, we saw the Dark Knight movies, Thor, Captain American, Iron Man, etc. Without this movie, many people in these superhero films would not have careers.Unlike the cartoons and comics, this is slightly different version of Spiderman with a different story. Why did they change? Dramatic purposes were needed. See the 2012 reboot to see why. A nerdy Peter Parker gets bitten by a spider at a high school science field trip and develops radical powers. Although still timid and soft-spoken, he gains confidence and tries to win over Mary Jane Watson: his life-long crush. Meanwhile, Norman Osborne's most recent Oscorp experiment goes drastically wrong and develops a vicious alter-ego--the Green Goblin--who Peter must stop.Anybody that says the 2012 reboot beats this either thinks Andrew Garfield is hot and/or are hardcore comic fans that don't understand how movies work. Tobey's Peter Parker is kind, caring likable, hardworking and mysterious that can't seem to catch a break. Mary Jane is sweet, has high hopes, is popular, and comes from a bad home. Norman Osborne is emotionally- destructive and tortured by his other personality, Green Goblin. This Green Goblin is freaking scary, yet funny villain that hasn't yet been topped. (Well, Heath Ledger did.) The Love story is original and better than the new one. In this, Peter keeps himself a mystery from Mary Jane, yet is still her emotional comfort who is always there. The new one is just him getting the girl right away and developing ""chemistry."" The hero doesn't get the girl in this? That is originality. This movie is also very unforgettable.Tobey is so much better than Garf-cat. For one, he doesn't have a stupid haircut. For another, he is smart, but the whole movie isn't just Peter doing science experiments and trying to find out about his parents. Peter is also more muscular and looks like a superhero type, while Garfield is just skin and bones. Peter is developed so well in this, we feel his exact moods. Garfield's weren't bad, but not good. Tobey wasn't disrespectful to anybody like Garfield was throughout the whole movie. Tobey was more deserving of his powers. Tobey's Spider powers being internal makes him more of a superhuman. Garfield's discovery of his powers were so stupid. Garfield wined a lot more than Tobey did. This Peter was constantly changing throughout the whole movie, Garfield stayed the same. Tobey pulled off the geek persona while Garfield failed at a geek trying to be cool. Tobey's Spiderman delivers funny one-liners while fighting villains while Garfield breaks out into extremely stupid 10 minute songs and dances. Garfield gives up hunting his uncle's killer. Garfield only saved, what, 2 people? And caused that death of Gwen's father. Tobey saved many people throughout the whole movie and causes no deaths. Sorry for so many comparisons. It's a dirty job, but somebody had to do it!4/4","9/10"
"Spider-Man","Puroo","6 April 2021","As someone who has read the original comics, I can very much see what all changes have been brought in this movie from the source material. And they have done it absolutely correctly. It seems better to see Peter Parker as someone who chooses to use his proto suit to fight in a cage match than to see him as a celebrity. The scene of Uncle Ben being shot down by a thug was really emotional to see, as he left the message for Peter - ""With great power comes great responsibility"".Peter is left to choose his own destiny as a high school teenager who has to deal with a death in the family, his career after school and being a new hope of humanity. At many points throughout the movie I felt that if I were him I would have been completely broken. But that's exactly what makes him a hero. He deals with all the situations and makes it look so simple.I even feel bad for Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin. He had worked so hard on his project but finally it was suspended. He was struck with grief and then the next moment he's the iconic Spider-Man villain. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin looked way better than the comic counterpart. And his motivations were exactly like how we'd expect Green Goblin to be like.Spider-Man is one of those movies I often come back to see from time to time. I really like how the very first Spider-Man movie has set a benchmark for the future movies. It looks absolutely natural and has pretty good CGI for its time. The visual tone and colour palette are absolutely like an early 2000s film. It's a must watch movie for anyone starting to see Hollywood movies.","9/10"

As true to source as you could wish.The matrix-esque trapese-ballet swinging, spinning and spidery-thingies achieved in rudimentary CGI highlights how far ahead they were, and in comparison to today's, how very far they've come! And, surprisingly, its pixelations do not detract from the love-triangle story!Will she or won't she? Does money trump hearts? Will she see through the facade? The heartbreaks central to developing the selfless character we all know and want to see are very well fleshed out throughout this quest to find true love. That resignation and rejection are part and parcel of the journey our hero must face to overcome his flaws is very The Oddessey by way of LOTR deep, if you follow the hero quest lore.Seeing the result of Peter Parker's hard choices and harder work, is as wonderful and joyful as his first swing down a New York avenue! Breathtaking moments in all genres: romantic, revelatory, and even rambunctious ones! For a guy that grew up running home from school to catch the afternoon timeslot of my favourite comic-to-real-live-action show: The Amazing Spider-man starring Nicholas Hammond; it was everything I dreamed and more!

"Spider-Man","tadavies-15568","17 February 2022","Watching Sam Raimi's spider-man trilogy is one of the most memorable parts of my childhood. As a reviewer I can accept that this could sway my opinion due to be blinded with nostalgia, however, I aim to be as professional as possible, this will be evident when I get to the third instalment of the trilogy.So what makes this film great? A number of factors do but to me it's the characters. With such a simple plot you need a strong cast and strong characters to take centre stage and they do, trust me.The highlight for me is the man himself Willem Dafoe who played my favourite character in this trilogy, Norman Osborn. Now I will admit some of this comes down to his lines that are delivered really well but have become glorified on the internet. But beyond this I think he's the best villain in this trilogy because he hits Peter where it hurts. When he finds he's Spider-Man he attacks his loved ones in a way the other villains don't do.As well as this, his goblin voice is iconic and he falls into the category of villains I love where they are actually having fun being evil. As Norman he also plays this cold distant man to his son and everything he does is perfect.The other great character in this is Peter Parker/Spider-Man. One thing I love about this trilogy and this film in particular that I feel none of the other on-screen interpretations master is the idea of Spider-Man and responsibility. Tobey Maguire isn't my favourite Spider-Man but he's my favourite Peter Parker because he grows in this film. This is most evident at the end when he gives up everything he wants because he knows it isn't the right thing to do. When faced with the possibility of joining the goblin he tells him that he had a father in the form of Ben Parker and gives up the love of his life knowing he'll hurt her. This is character development!What really emphasises all these character moments is the score by Danny Elfman. The iconic soundtrack hits at all the perfect moments and really conveys the tone of the scene along with the masterful direction of Sam Raimi. The plot is relatively simple which is good for an origin story and I love how we bounce back and forth between Peter and Norman.The side characters in this film are amazing too with Harry Osborn, MJ and Aunt May who all get standout moments. Even the smaller roles like Bruce Campbell as the wrestling announcer oozes character with about three lines of dialogue.Overall this is quintessential Superhero Cinema, if you haven't seen this you aren't a true Spider-Man fan.","7/10"
"Spider-Man","SnoopyStyle","22 February 2014","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who has a crush on his next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). His only friend may be Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of wealthy inventor Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). On a field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider, and he develops powers to become Spider-man. Meanwhile Norman is desperate to prove his formula for human performance to the military. When he test it on himself, it corrupts his mind and turns him into the Green Goblin.Sam Raimi has created a very good introduction to Spider-man. The actors are all very capable and fit their characters. Willem Dafoe is amazing as Green Goblin. The only minor complaint is the web slinging ability. It's a major change to comic lore, but I understand the reason. I always liked Peter Parker because he was the underdog nerd. So it's a great thing that this series starts off well. And who doesn't love an upside down kiss in the rain?","10/10"

"Spider-Man","carologletree","8 November 2016","The first Spider-Man film is a great one. Marvel arrived on the scene in 2000 with the solid if unspectacular ""X-Men,"" but it was kicked into higher gear in 2002 with the release of ""Spider-Man.""Tobey Maguire is phenomenal as Peter Parker, bringing just the right amount of nerdiness, vulnerability, and most importantly, heart. As Spider-Man, he really seemed to be having fun. He is comparable to Keaton's Batman and Reeve's Superman.The supporting cast is very good. Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane, and James Franco is also good as Harry. Other standouts are J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jamison and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin.Spider-Man's origin story is told quite well, and it moved along at a good pace. The film is very action-packed, and it is filled with the sense of fun that ""X-Men"" kind of lacked. Just the right amount of emotion is added to the film, and it also has a great soundtrack.There are a few cheesy scenes, but it is still overall a very entertaining and well-made superhero film. It was the kick in the pants that Marvel studios needed. Although this film would be surpassed by it's sequel, ""Spider-Man 2,"" it is still not to be missed.RATING: A-","8/10"
"Spider-Man","raysond","30 April 2002","I had the grand opportunity to see a special private screening of this eagerly anticipated movie and I must say I was definitely impressed and I was in total awe. Not since the last superhero movie I saw was there a more and clear and complete followup to the comic book and this one was totally it which had me on the edge of my seat and hanging on for more. ""Spider-Man"" is a grand transition to what a comic book hero supposed to be and for a good reason. It sticks to detail and while it does that it keeps its audience hanging on for more and then some. The acting of the cast was very,very good and for Tobey Maguire's performance as the teen stud Peter Parker/Spider-Man was the best characterization I've seen in a long time since the days of Christopher Reeve(who was the last good actor to play a superhero and to be true to the comic book format).As for the story itself,it kept its pace with the origins of the story and the comic book itself was right on precise target. As for the villain,actor William Dafoe was electrifying as Spidey's arch nemesis Green Goblin and the battle between him and our web slinger is something to behold. Even the leading lady,Kristen Dunst was not bad as Peter's girlfriend who keeps his identity a secret,but she knows who he is. As the good point of interest,the movie is worth the price of admission. Even if you're a fan of the Marvel comic book or a huge fan of Spidey's cartoon series of Saturday mornings,then this is the ticket to get. Be prepared for the ride of the summer,since this one is unbelievable. Kudos to director Sam Raimi for doing this right and finally bringing Spidey to the screen!!!!NOTE: There will be two more installments to the Spider-Man trilogy in which Spidey goes up against his greatest enemies like Dr. Octopus, Venom,and Mystiquo and not to mention the deadliest of them all......

The casting was great, Jameson was my favorite bit of casting, absolutely perfect. The pace was a bit slow in a few places, but nothing too major.The early scenes with Peter Parker learning to become Spider-Man were the best. A little bit campy at times, but a fun, enjoyable movie.","7/10"

"Spider-Man","adamjohns-42575","28 January 2022","Spider-Man (2002)-This is probably one of the few Comic Book to Film translations that gets the balance just right. Don't get me wrong, the whole 'Avengers Infinity Saga' is incredibly enjoyable, but seems to be based in a world closer to our own real existence and slightly less fantasy.In this film though, the use of a few more extreme elements - a quite camp Green Goblin, some corny lines and a camera filter that adds a slightly hand drawn feel to it, all seem to be just the right thing up against the everyday world seen otherwise.I actually love Tobey Maguire as Spidey. It's hard to pick between him and Tom Holland, because they are both so good, but I like the personality that Tobes delivers. I'm glad they chose to use him for the role and didn't opt for Leo as they might have done. There's a cute na√Øvet√© to him and he's got heart.Willem Dafoe on the other hand absolutely terrifies me and will never not be a source of nightmares.I do have to give credit to J. K. Simmons too. His portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson is superb and probably why they have used him in every incarnation of the web-slinger since. He's almost as iconic as the title character now.The special effects aren't the best, but they can be forgiven for the time that it was made. It's not ""Neville On The Broom"" bad at least. They're just a bit cartoony and somewhat computer game like by todays standards. It's easy to pick holes like that, when the technology we have 20 years later is so fantastically seamless and I'm sure that in 2002 I would have praised Tobey's CGI butt in his Spider-Man onesie.Fans of the comics that have read them from the start could probably list hundreds of reasons why this film is not right, but for me it's an easy and fun film to watch that is, for the most part family friendly. I know there was some indecision about its rating in 2002, but it's quite clearly a PG now.A great start to the Trilogy.795.55/1000.","7/10"

"Spider-Man","jeremycrimsonfox","4 August 2022","While Batman & Robin nearly killed the superhero genre by being a box office bomb that killed the original Batman film series, the year after would see it saved with the release of Blade, a movie that was a good mix of superhero and horror that, while bashed by critics, fans liked so much, that it would begin Marvel Comics' film success and opening the door to more superhero films. Spider-Man, the first in the Sam Raimi trilogy, would be the one to revolutionize the genre.Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) is a teen who is bullied, but has crush on Mary Jane Watson (played by. Kirsten Dunst) and is friends with Harry Osborne (played by James Franco), son of Oscorp CEO Harry Osborne (played by Willaim Defoe). However, getting bitten by a radioactive spider while taking pictures at Columbia University's Science Department, he soon develops the abilities and powers of a spider. At first, he uses his powers for fame and money, even competing in a wrestling match against Bonesaw (played by Macho Man Randy Savage), but he soon becomes a hero after his Uncle Ben is gunned down by a gunman he let escape when he robbed the wrestling organization. This leads him into a battle with Norman, who becomes the Green Goblin by subjecting himself to an experimental serum and killing his competitors and even his own board of directors for trying to oust him from his own company.Now this is an awesome movie for something in the early 2000's. Already, the film makes it clear Peter's origin as the wall-crawling superhero is not going to be a happy one, keeping the origin story true despite some changes (removing the TV performance, but keeping in the wrestling part, even going as far as to get an actual professional wrestler, Macho Man Randy Savage, to play Bonesaw, and Peter does not have web shooters, as the movie changes his powers to include the ability to fire organic webbing from his wrists), but it stays true to the comics, and keeps the important lesson ""With Great Power, There Must Also Come Great Responsibility"" that Spidey is well known for. The actors all do a good job, and the films manages to squeeze in some cameos (Bruce Campbell, who starred in the Evil Dead movies, one of Raimi's earliest directing credits, appears as the announcer for the wrestling march), and the music done by movie soundtrack legend Danny Elfman helps sets the tone. But the best thing is the special effects, which while not as advanced as the MCU Spider-Man films, as it makes good scenes, like Spidey and Green Goblin's parade fight.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","SPZMaxinema","16 September 2021","The original and absolutely iconic score, casting, and directing of this film are all really impressive and the best of the best! I think that this is the best that Spider-Man could've been for 2002, and Willem Dafoe and J. K. Simmons are legendary for their roles, along with Cliff Robertson as uncle Ben! This is the first superhero movie I ever saw all the way back in kindergarten/first grade when it first came out and I've loved it alongside my brother throughout my whole childhood, but as an adult I appreciate it so much more for its more mature, genuine aspects. It's not as perfect or full of heart as the second one in my opinion but I still can't deny they will never make a superhero movie like this again and this is one of the best first installments of a superhero franchise that will ever be made. THIS is a true treasure folks, THIS is how you do a fun superhero movie with a likable real character, and yes, even the memes that would come from it are all a treasure as well!","8/10"
"Spider-Man","Nahret","29 April 2002","Pardon my language, but it does rock. It rules. It's beyond what I had imagined. After seeing a movie that fulfills almost impossible expectations, a little teenage language can be forgiven, I think. Let's not forget that Spidy is a hero with a cult following, so, naturally, there will always be those who see sacrilege in the few (good! necessary! favourable!) changes the creators of the movie made with respect to the original comic. To those: Come off it! This is a great film; it has the perfect balance of action, drama, laughs and the mandatory romantic element. And, of course, in this kind of event cinema, everything hinges on the right choice of a leading man, and in this aspect, Tobey Maguire is absolutely perfect (am I overusing this word?) as the slightly nerdish Peter Parker. As Auntie May rightly points out, Spiderman is not Superman; Peter's process of discovering and learning to control his powers are among the most hilarious scenes in the film (that spider web thing isn't as easy as it looks). Kirsten Dunst is as lovely as always, and Willem Dafoe would make a good Goblin even without the mask on. Speaking of the villain, not only are we given one whose motivations are understandable, but being who he is, he even opens the door to the sequel.All I can say, if the rest of the movie summer comes on as strong as this film, then we're in for a memorable year indeed. Not to mention the possibility of multiple sequels. 9 out of 10.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","Leofwine_draca","29 December 2016","As much as I am loathe to admit it, CGI effects have been getting better and better in recent years. Not always are they just silly cartoon imagery which looks out of place. And they're mainly responsible for the resurgence in superhero/comic book movies that wouldn't have been possible ten years ago - films like BLADE and X-MEN which rely on CGI effects throughout. SPIDER-MAN is the latest in a long line of comic book heroes being adapted for the big screen, and it isn't half bad. Hardly Sam Raimi's best movie but a thoroughly entertaining popcorn flick which is surprising in that it offers up a fairly adult version of the story with an interesting back story to set up the major characters and an emphasis on character development instead of mindless action. That's not to say the film is without action, but the various set pieces are made to count and not just overdone as they so could easily have been.Most of the elements that make up this film are good rather than brilliant, but the combination is pretty flawless. Obviously the superhero story has been done before but Raimi offers enough originality (along with a few spots of his previous craziness in the zooming skulls and spiders in the first transformations) and vitality into his film to make it feel fresh and exciting. The script is intelligent and offers up strong, likable characters with believable motivations; even the villain is a schizophrenic more to be pitied than hated. The music by Danny Elfman is rather unnoticeable but the film makes up for this with good camera-work and excellently staged scenes of action - the wrestling ring fight, the cliffhanger bridge ending, the carnival disaster are all excellent examples of the fantasy action genre at its finest, offering up explosive thrills and hard-hitting violence. This is a film where the punches count.The CGI effects are blended nicely into the action and for the most part are pretty good, only looking shoddy a couple of times. As for the actors, Tobey Maguire makes a decent and respectable hero and even though his character development from nerdy geek to romantic lead is rather clich√©d, he makes a good fist of it - congratulations to the boy. Willem Dafoe is all hamminess in the role of the Green Goblin, the film's hoverboard-riding villain, and is great as always, especially with that infectious laugh of his. Kirsten Dunst gets a fair amount of screen time as the love interest and even though her character is fairly useless at least she looks good in the part. Special mention goes to James Franco as Dafoe's brooding son Harry, who also happens to be Spidey's best mate. Watch out for the parade of cameo appearances which include Raimi cohorts Lucy Lawless as a punk, Bruce Campbell as the overbearing ring announcer, and Ted Raimi as a newspaper man. Probably the most bizarre appearance goes to porn star Robert Kerman as the boat captain - this is of course the same guy who played Professor Monroe in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Sadly he doesn't get to say ""I wonder who the real Spider-Man is?"".","10/10"
"Spider-Man","eagandersongil","6 September 2021","""Spider Man 1"" was a small industrial revolution, 6 years before Marvel started building its universe, Sam Raimi was in charge of adapting one of the biggest comics for the cinema, and it's amazing that even with the dated visual effects, this movie was very well built.Spider-Man's script is one of its greatest virtues, although a little clich√©, we don't have a construction focused on combat only, we have a beautiful origin story, with great development arcs not only by Peter Parker but also by Norman Osborn, Mary Jane , Harry Osborn in addition to Peter's uncles who play a perfect role of tutor in the hero's arc, with constructive details of the character's own character and mute problems, Peter doesn't want to save the world, he just wants to make a difference to his neighborhood, the The pain of the hero's growth here and its consequences are details that are lacking in today's practically canned superhero movie market.Tobey Maguire, has a weak acting, it's true, the actor is little expressive, but he is charismatic and sells very well the character that makes him an icon in the film, the same happens with Kirsten Dunst, and all the rest of the supporting cast is really very good with a big emphasis on Willem Dafoe who simply steals the scene whenever he appears, the actor, besides being absurdly expressive and scary has a unique screen presence.The aerial visual effects have aged well, but the combat scenes haven't, but we can forgive, by the way, it's been 20 years since its release, the film is immortalized, although nowadays films of this genre are cold, little authorial and simply common, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is the opposite of that, building a unique and striking identity. 7.5/10.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","alekspredator87","26 July 2022","When you remember Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man movie, you can't help but smile. This is probably because now it is an unshakable classic, one of the first superhero films, of which there are now a dime a dozen. This is a film from childhood, which essentially determined the state of affairs for children's minds. It was simple. There is good and there is evil. There are no complications in the plot, dual interpretations of situations. It's just that there is a protagonist and an antagonist, and they fight each other, as good fights evil, so that one of them wins and thereby shows an interesting story.Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy with Tobey Maguire has generally become something bright and simple. And the first film in this series tells a measured story about the formation of a young hero and his acceptance of the fallen power and responsibility. The genre of modern superheroics has not even been born yet, the now famous successful Marvel Cinematic Universe and the less successful DC Extended Universe are not even planned. The just-launched series about X-Men is somehow remembered as a kind of comparison with the story of Spider Maguire. And it's even good. The viewer learns to understand the simple rules of this world, to accept the absolute polarity of the characters, to comprehend the laws of the presented universe. It is for this reason and the repeatedly complicated comic world of films, as well as the generally ambiguous surrounding real world with many existing truths, ""Spider-Man"" by Sam Raimi allows you to immerse yourself in one story of a young man who is looking for himself and finds it his duty to become a friendly neighbor for the residents of huge New York.The film came out soulful and intense. The few main characters allow the director, with the help of a competent script, to introduce us to all the actors and show their evolution in the allotted couple of hours on the screen. Tobey Maguire and his Peter Parker fit perfectly into the concept of the story. Already an adult actor has always seemed to me suitable for this role of a high school student. His manners, shy smile, true emotions - all this made it possible to see in Toby a high school student Peter Parker, who begins his growing up and transformation from an ordinary unremarkable teenager into a young man who learns to make adult and balanced decisions.Kirsten Dunst became popular at a young age, having played well in ""Interview with a Vampire"". And her appearance in Spider-Man once again confirmed that she is a great actress. However, in my opinion, the script did not particularly allow her to open up in this film. Her heroine Mary-Jane Watson appears as a defenseless girl who constantly needs to be saved by a famous hero, she sometimes looks like a trophy in the struggle between the young heroes of the film (Peter Parker and Harry Osborne) than a real person. And once again, I am sure that this is not the problem of the actress's game, but rather a scenario blunder or even simplification of her character.James Franco is also good. Let him really reveal himself to me in the third film of this franchise, here the young actor adequately shows the younger Osborne as a man who has been looking for his father's approval all his life. This is a complex character with his own internal problems, which are also sure to come back to everyone in future films.A separate decoration of the film is the actor William Defoe. That's who really pulls the whole picture. His Norman Osborn will give odds to any villain. Defoe, as always, is charismatic, bright and dangerous on the screen. You can't negotiate with him, you can't get away from him. He is purposeful, dangerous and incredibly attractive as an antagonist. Watching the actions of the Green Goblin on the screen is a pleasure. Given the complex family and friendly ties in this small circle of the main characters, the viewer is sure that even a family dinner is unlikely to be able to take place in a calm friendly atmosphere when such diverse characters are at the same table.Be sure to mention the kind of calm characters, which are Uncle Ben and Aunt May - relatives of Peter Parker. They seem to be the glue that binds together the whole picture, they represent the morality of this world and teachers, probably, for all the heroes and viewers. ""Great power carries great responsibility"" is a saying that, probably, both I and many other fans have carried and continue to carry through their lives. After all, these words are very correct and teach you to be able to be responsible for your decisions, especially when you are already becoming an adult and should be responsible not just for your actions and responsibility for yourself, but also for your actions and your family in trying to give her the best, as well as protect her from a bunch of different problems.""Spider-Man"" was born very timely. This is an ageless classic for my generation, a breath of that almost ideal and simple world that could never have been in reality, but that existed in Raimi's interpretation, when everything around was much less complicated than it is now. Then you knew that the world is much simpler, it is predictable. Now, when you look around, you clearly understand that the world is multifaceted and complex, it is much more difficult to do things in it, and the results of actions are unpredictable. This was taught not only by real life, but also by many times complicated superhero paintings, of which several dozen have since been released. In them, the world seems much more real and dangerous. And this fact also makes me remember the first picture of the trilogy about Spider-Man Maguire with special warmth in my heart. After all, this is a well-forgotten past, which sometimes you want to revive by simply re-launching the picture on the screen and hearing the first chords of the famous melody from the colorful screensaver.10 out of 10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","Horst_In_Translation","31 December 2014","""Spider-Man"" was the start to Sam Raimi's superhero trilogy starring Tobey Maguire, one of the most promising young actors back then, as Peter Parker. He does a solid job with the character. Raimi was mostly known at this point for another trilogy, namely the Evil Dead movies, which he started directing in his early 20s already. Apart from Maguire, the cast has many more famous names. Kirsten Dunst plays the love interest Mary Jane. I'm usually not too big on her as an actress, but she is okay here. Peter's uncle and aunt are played by Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson (who sadly died not too long ago just like his character here) and Golden Globe winner Rosemary Harris. The main antagonist, the Green Goblin, is played by Willem Dafoe and may very well be my favorite character and performance of the film. His son (and at the same time best friend to Parker) is played by the young rising star James Franco. J.K. Simmons has a small role here and he may very well win the Oscar this year. He certainly makes J. Jonah Jameson his own. And finally, Octavia Spencer, long before she became famous and won her Academy Award, plays a one-scene character as well.I wrote in the title that there is almost nothing wrong with this movie and you'd have to dig really deep to find something, maybe this could be the end. I found Mary Jane's love confession too cheesy somehow and Peter's reaction left a bitter taste too. It's the girl he loved all his life and he just says no to her. Cannot believe that even with the whole power-responsibility reference. But back to the more positive things. One of my favorite parts was how Parker and Osborn (Dafoe) had such similar paths to what they became. What Parker wanted most was MJ, what Osborn wanted most was the success of his company. First, both fight against outside influences (the enemy company, Flash), then against inside influences (the sale, Harry Osborn) in order to get what they want. Parker succeeds and fights for the good side. Osborn Sr. fails and becomes evil. Of course, apart from that the death of Parker's uncle and how it all happened also played a big role. It basically showed Parker that negative actions happening to other people can also affect him if he does not intervene.The movie runs for roughly two hours. There is a very clean split for Parker. The first half is about him being a normal boy who discovers his superpowers and we find out how he becomes Spider Man (including a funny wrestling match), who the people in his life are and how they shape him. The second half is pretty much all about the battle between Spider Man and the Green Goblin. Here, I especially liked the scene when Osborn realizes Spiderman's identity. That disguise scene in the burning house was great fun too. In the end, with the last comments from Franco's character, we get a bit of an appetizer for the sequel. On a random side-note, Raimi just recently reunited with Franco for ""Oz"".You could probably discuss if Maguire is a better actor than Andrew Garfield, but I have to say I definitely prefer Maguire's Spiderman. It works so well, even if he is already in his 20s playing a teenager and there are many memorable scenes in this film, including the kiss between Mary Jane and Spiderman obviously. Thumbs up for writer David Koepp who has also shown his talent on ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Mission: Impossible"" before 2002. And lets not forget Steve Ditko and Stan Lee, the latter even has a little cameo here. And finally a shoutout to Kevin O'Connell and Greg P. Russell, who scored one of the film's two Academy Award nominations and it seems they just cannot get the win. They would have deserved it for this one. Such a shame. The first Spiderman movie was, by far, the most seen film from the year 2002. Crowd magnets like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars came short. And for good reason. This is one hell of a joyride. Very much recommended.","9/10"

"Spider-Man","StevePulaski","2 July 2012","Peter Parker is the awkward, neurotic, socially inept teenager, interested in photography, and crushing on the prettiest girl in school, Mary Jane Watson. During his trip to a genetics laboratory, where the class learns all about genetically altered spiders, Peter is bit on the hand by one of the arachnids that escaped and slowly begins to possess powers beyond his wildest dreams. At first, he realizes he can see without the help of his glasses, next, he notices he can leap heights and flip to great lengths, and finally, he starts to acquire the ability to stick to walls and shoot webs out of his hands.He becomes the notorious and infamous, Spider-Man, where he has proved to be a burden to some, but a hero to others in his hometown of New York City, where he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). After his Uncle Ben is shot and killed during a robbery, Peter notices the city is nothing but scum and is determined to take down the cities' worst in the form of secrecy. Meanwhile, his close friend, Harry's (James Franco) father, Dr. Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the president of the Oscorp manufacturing corporation, where they make and supply weaponry to the United States Army. In the mix of it all, Osborn becomes, what newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) dubs, the ""Green Goblin"" who pilots a glider, and serves as the villain to Spider-Man's hero.What inevitably follows is a series of unplanned and very physical battle scenes taking place with the backdrop of New York City skylines to handle it all. There's also a subplot, involving Peter, played effortlessly well by Tobey Maguire, trying to impress Mary Jane, played by the talented and attractive Kirsten Dunst, by relentlessly saving her from calamity and trouble by sweeping in at the nick-of-time while she is either being held captive by the Goblin, intimidated by muggers or even falling to her death. The catch is Mary Jane doesn't know this is Peter, but on the side, she talks to him at various points in the film. They've lived next to each other for years, but Peter has always viewed her as the unachievable girl next door and Mary Jane has probably always found Peter to be the unfortunate geek next door. How she doesn't recognize his voice when ""Spider-Man"" saves her an astronomical three times is beyond me. She should probably stick to staying in doors.No bother. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is a fascinating and entertaining work of superhero fiction, collectively doing Marvel and all of its actors justice by blessing them with good material, a straight-shooting script, and action sequences that don't fail to impress. The kinetics and craft of it all are through the roof, and the twenty-five+ years the picture spent in development clearly was for the best. The film spends the first hour or so getting us acquainted with the man behind the mask, much like the original Marvel comics. We see Parker as a human, not an action figure, occupying a mask of uniqueness and power. The film shows the geek in the beginning, sympathetically, and then goes on to showcase him powerfully, where he is a placed in a role of certainty and bravery.Marvel comics were notorious for paying attention to the character behind the mask and the character in the mask. One thing Spider-Man neglects to showcase in its script and its main character is the agony and pain of it all. The second Marvel feature in 2003, Ang Lee's unfairly bashed Hulk, did a much better job at showing how a superhero's powers were more of a belligerent curse than a stroke of luck in a world of bitterness. Stan Lee infused his comics with so much life and enigma for the characters, plot progression, and the color of it all that the challenge to adapt it to film is definitely there. Raimi handles it appropriately and maturely, not becoming sidetracked with monotonous melodrama or overly-cutesy action sequences.The ones he does bring to the table are kinetic and stylish, showing off some of the most impressive photography and visual work of the year 2002, and brings two charismatic actors along for the ride. Spider-Man may not have the excruciating depth of Hulk, which created more cons than pros in the job of a superhero, along with establishing a sincere yet distant father and son relationship, but in its own right, it does so much in its two hours that you may need to stop for a breather.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. Directed by: Sam Raimi.","10/10"

"Spider-Man","jomayevans","16 December 2022","Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man. Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J. K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the world.","10/10"

After watching the original trilogy, I found that this series of movies is not worthy of its name. Though wrapped in fantasy elements, this is a story with a serious drama core that fits the definition of a Renaissance tragedy.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","reddragonhero17","8 August 2022","Ah, Spider-man more than everyone's favorite superhero, a role model to look up to, even in times of crisis. I was a big fan of the comics and cartoons growing up and I couldn't wait to see this movie in theaters when it first came out. It was so good I saw it twice. This is a lot more than a superhero movie, if you grew up in the early 00's as a kid or teenager this was the movie to the years of your life, the girl next door, your struggles in school and life in general, your triumphs, your pains, the enemies you face. Besides that, this movie was a ray of hope, released one year after the horrible 9/11 it showed how one person can pick us back on our feet and how strength of unity can overcome the most serious of obstacles thanks to one great quote late in the move: ""You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!"" Overall a timeless movie for the whole family!","8/10"
"Spider-Man","XweAponX","27 November 2012","By default, Comic Books are the perfect Pre-Viz for movies made based on them. And as a long-time Spidey fan, I was able to see the panels of this comic book come to striking life, sometimes reproduced with magnificent exactness in comparison to the way the books have been drawn and colored.As far as this initial offering goes, the choices of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe and James Franco allowed for an almost precise match to how the characters they each portray looked in the books. The casting of Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae, and J.K. Simmons as J Jonah Jameson: But it was not just the casting of actors who very closely resemble the characters of the Spider-man Universe, it was clearly Sam Raimi's direction in concert with the script by David Koepp based very closely on Stan Lee's ""Spidey"" Origin Story, which made these people come alive and pop out of the comic book frames, almost into real life.Compared to some of the other Marvel universe movies, this one was done with the most amount of care and respect for the series. Just to reproduce the postures of the flying web-slinger, using some of the most famous frames from the comics, was an astounding accomplishment.From his humble beginnings in ""Evil Dead"" Sam Raimi has been a clever filmmaker, especially in his ability to make splendid visual effects. Combine that with a huge budget along with Visual Effects god John Dykstra, who designed effects for Star Trek: The Motion Pic and the original Star Wars, back when it was still called that. Connect the dots with a fantastic Production Designer and Costume Designer, and it all just worked.One of the tests of how well Digital Effects have been done are in the viewing of these films on lower-resolution mediums, like smart phone screens and Old Cathode-Ray Tube TV's. I've viewed this film in each of those, and when Spidey is crawling up a wall in an obvious CGI shot, it makes you wonder if it really was CGI: In films like Daredevil, it is easy to spot the transition frames; here, it is impossible to find it.Comparatively, the work on Captain America showing Steve Rogers as a skinny kid is very clever. Here, the same tech is used in a smaller degree to show Parker as a wimpy, skinny nerd. This is highly effective so that when Parker sees himself buffed out with his shirt off, you believe a change has occurred.Where this film excels is in the rapidity of which it gets into the Spider-Man story, which is within the first ten minutes. As much as I do like the new Marc Webb ""Amazing Spider Man"" (2012) - It takes much too long to get into it, although the character development in that film is very good.In this film however, the character development continues through the film and is incorporated even into action sequences, Continuing up to the very last frame of the film.Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Dan Hicks (Of Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks) are all inserted as cameo properly as with any Raimi film. It is Campbell himself who ""names"" Spider-man - Saying ""The Human Spider? That Sucks!""My few complaints revolve around the character of Peter Parker, who is fairly unlucky in the books, here he is a walking disaster area. He is the antithesis of ""The Competent Man"" and even when given extraordinary ability, he is still a wimp in his personality, especially in his dealing with Mary Jane Watson. Also, Peter Parker's first Love interest was Gwen Stacy, and it was she, not MJ who The Green Goblin captured and gave Spidey the choice: Save these kids in the Cable-Car, or Save Gwen. It was a choice, and one or the other only could have been saved. Here, Gwen is absent totally, and he saves MJ with a feat even impossible for the comic- book rendition of Spidey.But I suppose adding Gwen to the mix would have muddied up the water too much. And even though I did not like the distortion of that original classic story, they did reproduce it visually with astounding correctness, as they did with the images of Spider-Man flying through NYC. Animating several classic Steve Ditko Spidey Postures, and at the end of the film we get to see many of these animated fantastically.But the main message: 'With Great power, comes Great Responsibility"" - As told by Uncle Ben to Peter right before his death, survives, and when coupled to Danny Elfman's main Theme, makes this a powerful, meaningful film.","10/10"

"Spider-Man","tedg","10 May 2002","Spoilers herein.I was profoundly disappointed in this because I expected a creative combination of two warring factions in filmmaking: the framers and the swoopers.Comics are rooted in the icons of preliteracy evolving into stained glass: brilliant colors and grand underlying mythology. Marvel comics (Stan Lee) adjusted the idiom slightly to make the mythology more accessible, and at the same time make each panel more active. He also popularized the overlapping of static panels on the page, so that not only was each panel composed, but each assembly of panels.Pulling on those two poles, the mythology and the framing, must be done simultaneously. By focusing more and more on the framing of the art, it allowed the referenced mythical power to increase. In other words, by making the images more static, the story became more dynamic and thus stronger. What made Spidey so novel was that his superhero action is primarily one of swooping and perching on oddly perspectived surfaces.So this particular comic, Spiderman, provides a much richer basis for effective film art than any other because it has a unique blend of framing and swooping. To appreciate the opportunity, you need to know one of the most lasting and interesting controversies in the film world.`Moving' pictures were seen as a sibling to `still' pictures which themselves inherited much from easel art. Similar equipment and conventions applied. All early movies placed the camera at eye level on a stationary tripod. The movement was one that a normal human observer would see. A second-order movement was introduced and mastered by Eisenstein, the movement of the camera from one shot to another. The individual shots were still from a stationary camera, but there was a choreography of the eye introduced. The setup of each shot was still essentially composed like a photo, rather like a comic panel in fact. The master of that today in film is Greenaway, but successful hacks like Speilberg mine what's been done. In fact folks like Speilberg compose their films first as comics (storyboards) and then replicate the frames.But there emerged a new school, led by Hitchcock that had the camera moving while the action moved. By controlling those moves, Hitch's camera had personality, curiosity. Tarkovsky and later dePalma mastered this and innovated so that some rare films have the eye as a main character. Today, essentially every filmmaker has a swooping camera because he/she can and because composing the Eisenstein/Kurosawa way requires insight beyond the skills of the current crop. So we now have a community of swoopers, mostly inept, constantly copying.So you can see how I got my hopes up. The Spiderman material was rooted in clever framing like Eisenstein/Kurosawa -- it is no accident that Peter Parker is the photographer of Spiderman.But it also depends on referencing and exploiting the swooping eye as with Tarkovsky/dePalma. It also makes heavy use of the odd-angled architecture of Welles, which clearly spilled more from his films into comics than into successor films.But what we get is a depressingly unoriginal treatment, wholly unaware of either the grand possibilities or even the educated eye. This is not just a pedantic concern -- you cannot have an exciting movie without an exciting eye. And this film's eye is hidden behind an inanimate mask. This is the Goblin's movie, not Spidey's","10/10"
"Spider-Man","Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23","29 June 2019","Intro:Many might be baffled by the 9/10 rating I gave this film. Many call it dated, and not as good as you remember. But, I think this film is every bit as good as you originally recalled, if not even better.What I Love:While this film is very cheesy, it's the classic origin of our favorite wall-crawler. I absolutely adore the storytelling of this film, with Sam Raimi's charm all over this film. From the incredibly relatable character of Peter Parker, and how he transforms into a superhero. As we see both the origins of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin happen at the same in the beginning of the movie.And while many might call it stupid, or over the top. These characters live in an over the top universe.And the world building is perfect. I feel like New York is a person. As we see the people of the city on screen. All the extras in this film are so colorful and have so much character, even though they're on screen for meat seconds.And every moment of this film is so fun to watch. The action, while dated, is very entertaining. The character interactions, are very entertaining. This was a childhood classic for me, and part of the reason I love it so much, is because it's very entertaining.I also enjoy the visual style of the film. It's so energetic in it's look. Just by looking at the film, you can tell Sam Raimi made it. It is drenched in his unique style of visuals. It uses CGI very well, and while the effects don't hold up, I think it helps the visual flare of this film. The city looks like it's out of a comic book, with the bright colors and vibrant locations.But, the best part of the film, are the characters. Toby MaGuire is still my favorite live action Spider-Man. And James Franco plays my favorite Harry Osborn. And Willem Dafoe plays the seriously over the top Green Goblin, and I love the performance.Peter Parker, he is played by an at the time, twenty something actor. Feels like a real needy teenager. He feels relatable. And he is an interesting character. Many might say he doesn't tell enough jokes. But I'm convinced it grounds him in a way. As it makes him feel more real. If I was battling a super villain, I wouldn't be telling be jokes, I would honestly be terrified.Harry Osborn, while in the other films, often over the top, Harry is still a three dimensional character. As he was often not treated well and neglected by his father. And his story over the course of this series. And this is demonstrated so we'll, in several scenes. Like when Harry introduces his father to Peter, calling him Norman Osborn, really showing the disconnect between the two. And at graduation, Norman congratulating Peter more than his own son.Norman Osborn is a really fun villain. With a wonderfully over the top performance in the part of Willem Dafoe. But he's a very interesting villain, as he was a rich businessman, who from the surface, seemed like a normal person. But from beneath, was really a cold hearted monster, and once he was turned into the Green Goblin, showed his true colors.Conclusion:Many might pick at the issues with this film, the campiness, the dated effects, the over the top nature, and other things. But that doesn't stop me from loving this film and the other two in the trilogy, even Spider-Man 3. I will always love the film. It was a great superhero film when it came out, and it's a great film even today.","10/10"

One of the best peformances I've ever seen Tobey Maguire is a phenomenal actor who is so talented, he is the reason I like this movie so much, he plays Peter Parker so well and I didnt want to see anyone else play him.Lovee my opinion or hate it, you cant deny how truly entertaining this masterpiece is and always will be.

"Spider-Man","lee_eisenberg","26 April 2006","I'll admit that I've never really been into comic books (or do people like to call them ""graphic novels""?). But whether you're into them or not, ""Spider-Man"" is sure to blow you away. More than just a superhero story, it shows how, as the title character reminds us: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" As Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire brings to the screen a superhero with whom we can all identify: misunderstood and searching for his goal in life. And Willem Dafoe makes one nasty, but cool, Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Other cast members include Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary Jane Watson; James Franco as Peter's friend (and Norman's son) Harry; Cliff Robertson as Peter's uncle Ben; and Rosemary Harris as Peter's aunt May.I also have to admit that around the time when this movie came out was the first time that I'd ever heard of Stan Lee (who appears in the movie briefly). Right before the release, he made a guest appearance on ""The Simpsons"" (the episode where Bart creates an online cartoon about Homer's mishaps). Two thousand two must have been a great year for Lee.All in all, you're sure to love this movie. I also recommend ""Weird"" Al Yankovic's song ""Ode to a Superhero"" (parodying ""Piano Man""), about the movie. Just great. I guess that Rosemary Harris is probably the only actress who can lay claim to starring in a movie about Hungary's history (""Sunshine"") and a superhero movie.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","nmholland","30 March 2016","Spiderman is directed by Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire as the awkward high school nerd Peter Parker. On a field trip to a science lab, Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained superhuman abilities of strength, reflexes, and heightened senses. He also now has the ability to stick to walls, and to shoot spider webs out of his wrists. When a new villain comes to town, a guy that calls himself the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Peter must handle his nerdy high school life, all while trying to save the city and the girl he loves, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).Spiderman was one of the first Marvel films ever made, right behind X-Men (2000), and it literally made my childhood. I had Spiderman posters, bed sheets, window curtains, you name it. Spiderman was a very influential movie, and still holds up to day. People still love the original Raimi trilogy (or, the first two), and most like Tobey Maguire better than Andrew Garfield (no offense Garfield fans). This film is pretty close to perfect, and I'm here to tell you why.One of the best things this film can offer is the close to perfect casting. Although Maguire might not make the best Spiderman, he definitely fits the role of Peter Parker, the high school loser that can't get anything besides his grades right. James Franco as Harry Osborn was a great choice, and was much better than Dane DeHaan with a face full of acne. Kirsten Dunst was a pretty good choice for Mary Jane, although I could've seen some other actress dye her hair red and then scream for two hours. Willem Dafoe was an amazing choice for Norman Osborn, or Green Goblin, and handled that role with a lot of confidence and pulled it off nicely. However, the best casting choice was J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. I truly believe that this was one of the best casting choices made in a film, ever. Simmons played Jameson perfectly, and was a highlight in every film, even the third one, but we don't talk about that.Another great thing this movie pulls off is the direction and special effects. Sam Raimi is a great director, we all know that, but he does even better in these films than in the Evil Dead franchise. His work with the camera brings a feel to Spiderman that nobody else, including Marc Webb, could handle correctly. Now, the special effects in a couple parts look somewhat dated, but overall, they are really good. Most of them still hold up today, except for a couple shots here and there.The score is also an extreme highlight of the film, done masterfully by Danny Elfman. Not even the great James Horner could replicate what Elfman did, when it came time to make The Amazing Spiderman (2012). The score adds an epic sense of liveliness to the film, especially in the action scenes (more on that later). The score sounds good with the film, or by itself, which really makes for a good soundtrack.Now, the action scenes were directed beautifully, and were very clean without an over abundance of cuts, especially the end fight between Spiderman and the Green Goblin. All of the impossible jumps that Spiderman makes, or when he swings from structure to structure look amazing, and this is all thanks to Raimi and his abilities with the camera. He can make a talking scene look nice, or he can make an action scene look nice, which is a great quality for a director to have.The best thing about this film is easily the vulnerability of our hero, Spiderman. Throughout the entire movie, Spiderman gets the crap beaten out of him, both physically and mentally. His thoughts are attacked, his body is attacked, his loved ones are attacked, and this is what makes the Green Goblin a great villain. He knows all of Spiderman's weaknesses, and he strikes them right where he should. This is where the film shines most, when the hero gets his butt kicked. This is because when the hero finally rises up to overcome the seemingly impossible hurdle, it makes the audience feel all that much better about his victory. This is common in all great films that contain a ""hero"", such as every film in the Dark Knight trilogy, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and even movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).Now, the only complaint I had, and this is very nitpicky, is the suit of the Green Goblin. There's no way to let it down easily, he looks like a Power Ranger. Although the suit doesn't look bad, they should've gone with something a bit more realistic, and not just completely comical. If they would've done this, he wouldn't have looked like a Power Ranger, and he possibly would've looked as cool as he actually was.Overall, Spiderman is an amazing superhero movie, and an amazing movie, and one of the best origin stories put to film. I recommend Spiderman to anyone and everyone; it's worth your time.","10/10"

"Spider-Man","emjgiddy","13 September 2023","""Spider-Man"" is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves a perfect 10-star rating. Directed by Sam Raimi and released in 2002, this film not only set the standard for modern superhero movies but also captured the essence of what makes Spider-Man one of the most beloved and iconic characters in the world of comic books.At its core, ""Spider-Man"" is a coming-of-age story about Peter Parker, brilliantly portrayed by Tobey Maguire. We watch Peter transform from a high school outcast into the selfless and courageous hero that is Spider-Man. Maguire's portrayal is endearing and relatable, making Peter's journey one that resonates with audiences on a deeply personal level.The film's antagonist, Norman Osborn, played by Willem Dafoe, is equally compelling. His transformation into the maniacal Green Goblin is both tragic and chilling, providing a formidable and multi-dimensional foe for Spider-Man. The dynamic between hero and villain is a central element of the film's success.""Spider-Man"" excels in storytelling, with a well-paced narrative that balances action, drama, and character development. The film explores Peter's struggles with his newfound powers, the responsibilities that come with them, and the sacrifices he must make. These themes of power and responsibility lie at the heart of the Spider-Man mythos and are expertly woven into the narrative.The action sequences are groundbreaking, with Spider-Man's acrobatic web-swinging and combat choreography still holding up remarkably well today. The film's practical effects and visual effects were groundbreaking at the time and continue to impress.Raimi's direction brings a comic book sensibility to the screen, with dynamic visuals and camera work that evoke the feel of the source material. The film captures the spirit of New York City, and Danny Elfman's iconic score adds to the sense of heroism and adventure.""Spider-Man"" is not just a superhero film; it's a timeless classic that transcends the genre. It beautifully captures the essence of Spider-Man's mantra, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" and delivers a heartwarming and thrilling story that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. It's a film that not only redefined superhero cinema but also remains a testament to the enduring power of storytelling in the world of cinema. A perfect 10-star rating is well-deserved for this iconic film that continues to inspire and entertain generations of fans.","8/10"

After the murder of his uncle, Peter decides to use his powers to help people and fight crime. Meanwhile, billionaire Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) undergoes an experiment that gives him superhuman abilities of his own. It also drives him crazy and sets him on a collision course with Spider-Man.Maguire, James Franco, and J.K. Simmons are all great. Kirsten Dunst wasn't my ideal Mary Jane but she actually does very good. She's likable and pretty, which is about all the part is asking for here. The Green Goblin is probably the movie's biggest failing. They didn't really get his character right and Willem Dafoe's performance is too campy. Changing him into an armored goon didn't help matters.The bright, mostly upbeat tone is exactly what a Spider-Man movie needs. However, it does highlight some of the fakeness of the CGI. The special effects are generally good although at times when Spider-Man is complete CGI he has that rubber-limbed thing going on. The organic web shooters bothered me more before I saw the movie than it did while watching. Although I could've done without the gross microscopic closeups of his fingertips to show us how ""spidery"" he is. Danny Elfman's score is forgettable and not in the same league as his work with Batman.Not quite the defining movie for Spider-Man as '78 Superman or '89 Batman were for those characters, but good nonetheless. The part of the movie where Peter decides to become a superhero and start fighting crime seems a little rushed and not as momentous as it should have been. It's a good start, though, and the sequel would be all that and more.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","philip_vanderveken","21 February 2005","Comic books like Spider-man, Superman, Hellboy,... have always been a part of the American popular culture, but aren't well known by the biggest part of the European public. So when a movie, based on one of these comics (we've seen several passing by in the multiplexes in recent years) is released, its main audience will be American as well. Unless they make something spectacular out of it of course, and that's exactly what the makers did with this movie. Spider-man is a movie full of spectacular computer animated graphics, plenty of action and symbolism and, much to my surprise, with a decent story (even though that's not the main reason why you should watch this movie).Peter Parker is a nerdy high school student who gets bitten by a genetically modified spider. Its DNA gets mixed with Parker's DNA and gradually he finds out that he now has capabilities he could only dream of before. He's strong, he can scale walls and ceilings without any help or appliances and he has some kind of sense that allows him to avoid dangerous situations. At first he only uses his powers to make money as an amateur wrestler, but when his uncle gets killed by a criminal, he decides to use his powers only to fight crime and to help society and to win the affections of his classmate Mary Jane Watson. In the meantime Norman Osborn, a scientist and businessman is exposed to some kind of nerve gas that he was developing for the military and develops an alternative personality: the evil Green Goblin.Despite the fact that the Green Goblin looked more like a bad guy from the ""Power Ranger"" and wasn't very original or impressive to me, the entire movie wasn't as bad as I feared. I actually had a good time watching this movie that, let's be honest, wouldn't get much attention if the stunning computer graphics weren't in it. So, despite the fact that I'm not a fan of comic books and the fact that the Green Goblin wasn't the most successful character, I liked what I saw. That's why I give it a 7.5/10.","10/10"

Willem Dofoe as the Green Goblim is such a joy to see, he is hilarious and is probably one of my favorite superhero villains in cinema. This movie is so corny, that you honestly can't stop smiling. Superhero movies don't always have to take anything seriously, and this is a movie that is the perfect example. Also JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is perfection. Whoever casted him to play the character should be a millionaire because he is actually the best thing about this movie.

The movie ""Spider-Man"" first of all seemed to me very instructive. It clearly shows how just one case can change a person's whole life, and indeed his worldview. This situation that happened in the film reminded me of one phrase: ""A man learns only from his own mistakes.""The plot of the film is more than interesting, and despite the fact that the film goes on for quite a long time, it is watched in one breath. There are so many moments in the movie that make me want to cry...","8/10"

The message of the movie ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!"" and no wonder it matched with the exciting and enjoyable motion picture. That's why this movie made so great.","5/10"
"Spider-Man","ThunderKing6","6 December 2021","Oh by the way MCU for this review means Mediocre Cinematic Universe.This one is really hard to judge in 2021. I've seen these movies dozens of times in the past but not in awhile sort of (youtube clips). I've been watching some clips and watching rants against Tobey Spiderman, Long Neck Spiderman and of MCU Spider-Man and my judgment of these films have slightly changed.Story: A Khazarian looking Spiderman is bitten by a bug and now plays superhero. He must balance his Peter Parker, his world, city and his Spiderman.Production: It was a well grounded and engaging film. At the time it was top-notch effects. Still Today it holds up in some places and some places are really corny. From rewatching, Tobey looks really bored. He had no range, no excitement he was just a bored superhero. It was like he didn't want to be there. All other actors/characters were great. The Chemistry in the first one was mostly there.Main Intelligence: Peter is a smart kid. Norman is a smart dude. I just don't understand why Peter wants to save worthless people who don't care about themselves. Pete is just a kid endangering himself to save people who are weak and ignorant. To me, he's kind of dumb for that. Haim Saban the producer of Power Rangers once called his Power Rangers ""5 R*t*rds in spandex"". When I look at this Spiderman he reminds me of the Power Rangers seeming like a R*t*rd in spandex"". I like Spiderman and superheroes, but upon rewatching and recently watching Ultimate Spider-Man it just made me think.Highlight: Green Goblin was iCONIC. He was a simple psycho villain. His banter, him gliding was cool. I have no beef with the costume. I think producers thought this movie would fail and had no confidence in superheroes. That's why they probably cast a borderline decent actor in Tobey and the movie looks cheap in some places.Cliffhanger: Harry wants revenge against Spider-Man. What he doesn't know Peter is Spiderman. #PeterParkerisatrollloki. To me Peter felt like a Loki because he wasn't being honest to his friend.Should you watch this movie?: Yes. If you are a superhero geek. This movie was simple and fun. Other than Blade, Spider-Man helped add coal to the superhero movie era preMCU. It's not a movie to take seriously despite Tobey's boring, dull persona it's a fun flick to chill and watch. The extras were funny as heck in this one. It has tons of memorable moments. Prior to I always rated Tobey Spider-Man as superior. I still think it is due to it being so grounded and very cartoony. Amazing Spiderman looked dull and depressing, however that Pete though annoying had more energy than Tobey Parker. I'm not one to be enslaved by fan service or nostalgia, so today I was eager of knocking the rating from a 9 to a 5 or 7. I'll keep it as 9. It's also weird that this movie is in the 7.3's. I thought it would be above 8.3. Oh, well.","7/10"

Stop right there. This is not that kind of review. Instead, I will give you several reasons why you should watch Homer Simpson and his ""Spider-Pig"" rather than this or any other ""Spiderman"" sequel.1. Spider-pig is funny. Tobey is merely sleepy and boring. 2. Spider-pig walks on the ceiling with grace. Tobey doesn't. He looks like an apathetic, clumsy 30 year-old moron impersonating a teenager. 3. Spider-pig has a great sidekick: Homer. Spiderman has none. 4. Homer's relationship with Spider-pig is far warmer and real than Spiderman's could ever be with Kirsten Dunst. 5. Spider-pig has Danny Elfman's likable tune to follow his zany adventures. Tobey/Spiderboy has only crap commercial U.S. truck-driver rock to accompany his every sleepy move. (Note those always semi-closed eye-lids; rumours say 500 angry tse-tse flies stung him...)6. Spider-pig emits huge amounts of toxic excrement as a way to hurt his enemies. Spiderboy just shoots unconvincing CGI strings. 7. Spider-pig is much more handsome than Tobey Maguire. 8. Spider-pig is alert and quick. Tobey is drowsy and dull. 9. The pig that plays Spider-pig is a much better actor than Tobey Maguire.The only aspect in which Raimi's Spiderman franchise beats Spider-pig is that Tobey's girlfriend Dunst is much better-looking than Spider-pig's sow mistress.The success of the ""Spiderman"" movies proves two things, first and foremost: 1) today's film-goers will watch any crap and love it, as long as it's hyped properly and sufficiently, and 2) Sam Raimi will never make another movie that comes even within light-year distance of his first two ""Evil Dead"" movies.If you loved ""Spiderman"", you must be either 9 years old or a...","10/10"
"Spider-Man","sammielimehouse","12 December 2020","Spider-Man is one of the most famous superhero movies of all-time, and it is also recognized as what popularized modern superhero flicks. And although it can be goofy and weird at times, the film is brought together by Danny Elfman's fantastic score, Sam Ramie's phenomenal directing, and all of the cast's performances. In summation, this is a very good film.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","Red_Identity","23 March 2012","Overall consensus on Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise?by you I only saw the third once, when it came out, so I don't remember it enough to actually judge it. But, rewatching the first two today I was reminded of how great they are. Raimi perfectly blends in cheese, camp, humor, drama, and action in one fantastic package. The comic book style is still in tact, and I noticed that unlike Nolan's Batman franchise, the heart is apparent here. These films give off a good-natured, mainstream vibe. The characters are all excellently written, and so it makes it so easy to relate to them. Raimi does so much with the source material in the way it's all edited together. The first two are honestly great and perhaps as great as something like this could ever be, so why why WHY reboot (remake) this after 10 years? There's simply no reason. It's not like the trailers for the new one suggested it to be darker, because these aren't dark and yet their dramatic moments hit hard. I hate to say it, but I do think that Raimi did more to this franchise than Nolan ever did to the Batman one. People like to criticize Nolan's writing, but I think the reason why his films' flaws are more apparent on rewatches is because of his direction style. Technically amazing, both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but as much as he tries he can't make the smaller moments count. Maybe it is his screenplays, or I simply don't know. My point is, after The Dark Knight people forgot all about these films (and because the 3rd left a bad taste). People like giving TDK credit for being dark and complex, and while it's true that it's tone is different than others of the sort, I think Raimi's films have a lot more to them. I simply just don't know why a reboot happened.","8/10"

People often say the best superhero film is Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, yeah i agree with them it is a masterpiece but spiderman also do deserve the same recognition as it has layed the theme to make a good Superhero movie. William dafoe portrayal as Green Goblin was outstanding he made me shiver while watching few scenes when i was a kid. I would definitely recommend this movie to all it is a fun to watch this film.","1/10"
"Spider-Man","timefreezer7","21 November 2003","Directed by Sam RaimiWritten by David KoeppStarring: Tobey Maguire , Willem Dafoe , Kirsten Dunst and James FrancoAfter years of anticipation and a never ending court battle concerning the legal rights ,  a big budget cinematic adaptation of the well known comics superhero has finally made it to the movie theaters . First of all I should say I was never much of a Spider-man fan , I have never read comics but is there any person on earth who doesn't know the red clad hero who jumps from building to building ? I doubt so . My only knowledge of Spider-man was some cartoon show where he makes a dynamic trio with Iceman and Fire-Star . I am not aware of anyone of Spidey's enemies and I was not familiar with his origin and motives . Nevertheless I am keen on comics generally and I always like seeing comics characters materialize on celluloid . So I got really excited when I heard that the project FINALLY got green-lighted and that Sam Raimi eventually took it upon him to shoot the Spider-man motion picture . I will have to admit that most of the comments are 100% right . Spider-man (2002) may not be a GREAT film but it sure is a good one (and it beats the hell out of the overrated and disappointing 2000's X-Men) .I don't think the plot is significant . The movie remains as faithfully to its comics origins as it could be and it satisfies both the hardcore well-knowing fans and the uninitiated like I am . Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy 17 year old student ,  not much accepted by his social environment and constantly being picked by his bullies classmates . He has a secret crush on the beautiful girl next door Mary Jane `M.J.' Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly knows he exists . When he is bitten by a mutated super spider he is bestowed with special powers like climbing on windows with his bare (albeit sticky) hands , ejecting spider nets from his arms , incredible acrobatic agility and enhanced danger-approaching instinct. While he tries to adjust to his newly obtained powers he finds himself caught in a war that a fiendish super criminal called the Green Goblin has declared against him . The Green Goblin is a maniac who wreaks havoc and kills innocent people using military equipment and weaponry . He believes that Spider-Man is the only real threat and wants to bring him down . The Green Goblin is actually the alter-ego of Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) a very wealthy businessman / scientist who has started developing a split personality and the deranged Green Goblin becomes more and more dominant driving him to madness . Norman's son is Harry (James Franco) who coincidentally is Peter's best friend and classmate . So Spider-Man will try to stop the Green Goblin before he kills more civilians and simultaneously will try to get Mary Jane's attention .That's it folks . The film spends much more time on the love story between Peter and Mary Jane and less on action . I always like character development and human relationships unfolded in superhero films but a little more action wouldn't heart either . Basically we see Spider-Man beat up some random thugs on alley streets and that's it . The balloon sequence in the middle of the film is nice but awfully reminiscent of Batman (1989) . I wish there were more epic battles between Spider-man and Green Goblin with more explosions . Some other things I didn't like either were :
1) Even worse CGI SFX than the robot soldiers in the Phantom Menace !!! I never thought it could happen but here it is . The shots of Spider-Man in the beginning of the film jumping from the top of a building to another is a lame cartoon that will not convince even a 3 year old viewer . I cannot describe how laughable and fake this Spider-man cartoon is : you will have to see for yourselves .2) The acting is average from all the actors . None of them manages to deliver fully the dramatic depth of the characters as scripted by the writer. The worst performance belongs to Willem Dafoe . His mirror communication scene was nicely scripted but Dafoe is extremely bad and unconvincing . What exactly happened here ? I liked him in Body of Evidence and Speed II but his talents seem to have been erased in this film . I will have to admit that some of the Green Goblin's lines gave me the creeps but can anyone assure me that it was really him under the suit (or his voice for that matter) ? Maguire's  and Dunst's acting is better but still mediocre . Speaking of the duo , one other flaw is that they don't have enough chemistry together (like Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder) . If they made a more fitting pair the screen time spent in their romance would be more worthily used . And if James Franco has the most impact screen presence is because his character requires for him to sit back and look calm and cool (and it is obvious that's the reason why they cast him) . The secondary characters like Peter's uncle and aunt act OK but that newspaper editor was too annoying to like him.3) The Green Goblin is never developed and is not much of a formidable foe . Maybe it was intentional to give him little screen time in order not to pull another scene-stealer (a la Joker) and give all the focus on Spider-Man . Unfortunately a great action film always needs a powerful evil character to be the opposition AND the driving force for the hero's existence .
Aside from these flaws the movie has all the features of a good blockbuster . The red suit of Spider-Man is faithful and really convinces us that the character has come to life ! There are some good scenes like the one where Peter finally beats up one the bullies in school . My favorite scene in the movie is a great surprise and that's why I cannot give it away. All I can say if you haven't watched the film , is the sequence where the Green Goblin sings `The itsy , bitsy spider.' . I also digged the final duel between Spider-Man and Green Goblin . Without being too violent it is an exciting fight , larger-than-life and worth our money . I just wish the rest of the movie reached the same adrenaline levels . Despite a lackluster performance , Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker . He suits the geeky looks the character has and convinces as a 17 year old with continually growing power (physical and personal) . The film has an obvious open end as a set up for the sequel . Much like some recent blockbusters like the Matrix or X-Men the first film is clearly an introductory chapter wanting to lure the audience to a whole franchise . You wait for more action in the next film , more exploitation of the potential of the story and you have a curiosity to find out where the relationships between the protagonists will lead . Spider-Man however manages to rise above the aforementioned films . Why ? Because it is a GOOD introduction . Where X-Men made the mistake of under using  10 characters without any success , Spider-Man has ONE main character . This is what I like most about Raimi's film . We follow Peter Parker from the very beginning . We have a taste of his life before the drastic change occurs and then we have the transformation in front of our eyes full play ! There is not a single superhero film that bothered to show us the beginning of the character . Obviously they thought it would be dull for the already initiated comic book fans but they were wrong . Yes there are other films with scenes were the motives were explained like Batman and some opening establishing scenes like the first Superman . But Raimi's Spider-Man is unique : we SEE Peter Parker training with his super powers , trying to control them and we even get to see him pick his costume . Now I will keep my reservations because I have yet to see the recent batch of Marvel comic-book adaptations like Daredevil or Hulk but for now Spider-Man is the best introducing film you will find . The metaphor about the responsibility of a teenager turned into a mature adult is also explored . The realistic approach is successful here . First of all the first thing Peter does with his powers is to try earning money . Only later he decides to use them for the city 's good and safety . Secondly despite some nitpicking from fans it is quite logical that Spider-man's web-shooting is an organic power . Peter is just 17 and as much as he is supposed to be a science genius he wouldn't have the money or the technology to invent some synthetic web shooters . The Green Goblin outfit sure looks like a Power Ranger suit but it is also realistic as it is a piece of military equipment and not a Halloween costume . New York City is depicted as a shiny town and establishes a truly existing environment for the story to take place .Spider-Man (2002) for all its weaknesses is a good film with some of the best narrative I have seen . The voice-overs by Maguire help us identify with him even more . The film is better than some other comic book flicks like Phantom or Spawn (not entirely their fault since these characters are less appealing and therefore less known) Dick Tracy , The Mask or the Shadow (good idea but mediocre script / execution) or over hyped blockbusters like the X-Men . It will not be a classic like Superman II or Batman but it is one of the best of the bunch of the `comic-book' genre . I rank it up there with the 3 Batman sequels , Judge Dredd and the original Superman .

"Spider-Man","mark.waltz","18 July 2023","The Marvel comic world exploded into cinematic existence with the first big screen adaption of the popular comic strip, and it's one of the greatest super hero movies ever. Toby McGuire is perfection as geeky high school student Peter Parker whose reaction to the bite of a genetically altered spider is to turn into a young man who can shoot webs out of his hands, do back flips and other gymnastic movements and climb walls. ""With great power comes great responsibility"", his uncle and surrogate father Cliff Robertson tells him, so the entirely decent McGuire decides to use these powers for good, fighting crime, that is after he gets revenge on high school bullies and the thug who was responsible for his uncle's death.Veteran actors Robertson and Rosemary Harris are delightful as his aunt and uncle, with Harris's gentle demeanor hiding a no-nonsense view of life, and you can see why Peter has turned out to be a great young man. Willem DaFoe is the father of his only school friend who has a metamorphosis himself, but it's the complete opposite, turning into evil as the green goblin, even though his human self is law abiding and basically decent. As the feisty girl he likes, Kirsten Dunst plays an A group girl who tends to stand up for the underdog, and that makes her quite likeable, even though she has questionable tastes in boyfriends. That is until she sees Peter for who he is, although completely unaware of his secret powers. Joe Manganiello is very funny as the fast talking newspaper editor who takes a chance on Peter as a free lance photographer.The special effects are outstanding and the pacing non-stop. Watching McGuire go from clumsy kid to superhero is amusing as he slowly learns of all his super powers and how to best work them. The streets of New York City have never gotten such a special effect laid workout on film, even with asteroids, ice ages and tidal waves attacking it, and the best Macy's Parade since the original ""Miracle on 34th Street"". No sequel or resurrection or even a scandal ridden campy (and unnecessary) Broadway musical can recapture what this film brought, pure big screen magic. Another rare modern classic that left me with a goofy grin throughout my viewing.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","BA_Harrison","4 July 2014","Having already proved himself more than capable of creating a fun comic-book style movie with Darkman (1990), Sam Raimi finally had a crack at the real thing in 2002 with Marvel's Spiderman‚Äîand he did a remarkably good job, delivering a slick, action-packed, major-studio, summer blockbuster that genuinely feels like a superhero comic-strip brought to life, with colourful cinematography, perfectly nuanced performances and the director's playful visual style very much in evidence (as opposed to those dreary Nolan Batman films that take matters far too seriously).Starring Tobey Maguire as the titular web-slinger, Spiderman is an 'origins' movie, and as such takes a while to get the slam-bang action, but the characters are so well defined and the script (by David Koepp) so smartly written that boredom is never an issue. I've never been much of a fan of comic book movies that dwell too heavily on the whole 'tortured soul' aspect of their central character (as in Nolan's miserable Batman films), and with Spiderman being one of Marvel's classic 'emotionally troubled' heroes, there was serious potential for this to be a rather joyless affair. Thankfully, Raimi handles the personal trauma in such a manner that it never drags the enjoyment factor down. This is pure entertainment all the way‚Äîa real corker of a superhero film that still has the power to wow well over a decade after its original release.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","med_1978","15 November 2005","I would like to say firstly I am not a Comic Book nut and have in fact hardly read any. But I do like Comic Book/Superhero Movies. Having seen a great many Comic Book Characters/SuperHeroes/Vigilantes brought to the big & small screens such as Darkman, The Flash, Batman, Spawn, X-Men, The Hulk, The Crow, Superman etc. I must say I did enjoy Spiderman and it was slightly better than I anticipated. I remembered seeing re-runs of the Nicholas Hammond TV Series in the late eighties when I was a teenager and thought them OK but a bit lame. I am not a fan of any of the Stars in Spiderman either (although I think Willem Dafoe is a good actor). I found myself thoroughly entertained from beginning to end, however that is all this movie is ENTERTAINMENT. The fact that Peter Parker is bitten by the Spider in the beginning and no-one else is, is a little hard to swallow, why does it not bite other people then we could have loads of Spidermen!(in reality spiders mostly keep away from people). But if you don't think about the what if's etc. and go along for the ride it thoroughly entertaining fast paced fun. There are the usual clich√©s, the mad scientist who must test his work on himself resulting in changes of mood and eventually becoming the villain (see The Fly & Hollow Man for other examples of this), the fight with the School Bully, and the ending is predictable.I found the romantic Scenes between Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst to be surprisingly the best parts of the film, and also the scenes where Willem Dafoe's personality is being taken over by his alter ego The Green Goblin.Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker was completely believable and having now seen him in the role I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it better, Kirsten Dunst was good as Mary Jane, I also though James Franco was good as Parker's friend and unbeknown to him the son of the principal villain Willem Dafoe, whose performance was as usual very good although a little over the top as the Goblin but this is the norm I guess with this type of film. I also thought Cliff Robertson was okay in his small part.I prefer darker comic book films and found The Crow, Batman (1989), Batman Returns and X-men to be better films. This Film is however is WAY BETTER than all the overrated Superman films (far too much humour)and The Hulk, Batman Forever, Batman and Robin, Catwoman, The Punisher, Daredevil, Elektra & Sam Raimi's own Darkman + all The Crow sequels.I would give this film 5 1/2 or 6 out of 10","8/10"

The story is interesting enough and the action moves the story at a good pace. Tobey Maguire is well suited for the part of Peter Parker, but I'm having trouble with him transforming into Spider-Man. Willem Defoe is great as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. I am most impressed with Kirsten Dunst and even get a kick out of the red hair. It is also good to see veteran actor Cliff Robertson working again. Over all, the movie is very entertaining. Amazing F/X and the Danny Elfman score deserve credit for this movie's success. I hate to say that SPIDER-MAN is not my choice for this summer's blockbuster. A pretty good movie, but to me not a 'knock your socks off' flick.","9/10"

"Spider-Man","HotToastyRag","24 February 2020","I'm extremely loyal to the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man series. In my opinion, there are no other acceptable versions, and I'd never even consider watching the subsequent remakes. Tobey is the perfect Peter Parker, and the movies are treated with such care and respect, they don't feel like traditional comic book movies at all.The first one is the origin story, and who doesn't love the first in a series when everything is explained and introduced? Tobey is the unpopular, shy high schooler who has a crush on the girl next door and lives with his aunt and uncle. Mary Jane, the beautiful heroine, is played by Kirsten Dunst, and while she famously dyed her locks red for the subsequent movies, she wears a wig in the first one. I prefer the shiny, lustrous wig since it's more vibrant and attention-grabbing. Rosemary Harris may retain her role as Aunt May in all three movies, but Cliff Robertson gets to deliver the immortal line, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Everyone in this movie is memorable and important, and if you grew up watching this franchise in the theaters, your loyalty probably lies with them. J.K. Simmons seems like he crawled off the comic pages as the hard-boiled newspaper editor with hilarious one-liners. Who else can play the father-son Osborns but Willem Dafoe and James Franco, a pair of actors capable of being incredibly likable with a darker edge beneath the surface? Who else can endear himself as an unlikely hero who tries to atone and clean up crime in the big, bad city but Tobey Maguire and his innocent, expressive eyes?Obviously, the Spider-Man movies are going to have great special effects and thrilling action sequences. Whether he's battling the Green Goblin or merely testing out his new flying powers, you're in for a great, fun ride.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spider-Man flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","7/10"

"Spider-Man","kevin_robbins","16 September 2023","My daughter and I recently enjoyed watching Spider-Man (2002) on Netflix. The story revolves around Peter Parker, who lives with his aunt and uncle and secretly harbors a crush on his neighbor, Mary Jane, believing she doesn't notice him. However, when Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider during a class field trip, he gains superpowers that could finally catch Mary Jane's attention. Simultaneously, his best friend's growing animosity towards his father sets the stage for a potential super villain's emergence.Directed by the iconic Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead), the film features a stellar cast, including Tobey Maguire (The Great Gatsby), Kirsten Dunst (Melancholia), Willem Dafoe (Platoon), James Franco (127 Hours), Cliff Robertson (Escape from the Condor), Rosemary Harris (Before the Devil knows You're Dead) and J. K. Simmons (Juno).Spider-Man boasts a perfectly cast ensemble that excels in portraying the relationships within Spider-Man's universe. The circumstances leading to Uncle Ben's tragic demise, the rise of the Green Goblin, and Peter's relationship with Mary Jane are all beautifully depicted. Kirsten Dunst shines as the quintessential girl next door, despite some peculiar wigs, and the action sequences are nothing short of tremendous. The Macy's Day parade battle is a standout moment, and every web-swinging scene deserves a 10/10 rating. The CGI and soundtrack are top-notch, and who can resist a Bruce Campbell cameo? My only gripe lies with the Green Goblin suit, which falls short of the character's potential, despite Willem Dafoe's excellent portrayal as the villain.In conclusion, Spider-Man is a true gem in the superhero genre, deserving of its royalty status. I would give it a solid 9/10 and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an action-packed and emotionally engaging cinematic experience.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","CuriosityKilledShawn","29 April 2004","As a fan of Spiderman I was deeply let down by this stupid, gaudy, 'Hollywood' movie version. There are so many things wrong with it I could go on for ages.First of all, it's HORRIBLY miscast. Tobey Maguire is NO Peter Parker, he is so completely wrong for the part. Jake Gyllenhaal could have been much better. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson seemed like a typical studio-exec choice. Instead of finding someone who could actually be a model/actress with a statuesque figure, real auburn hair with green eyes who could bring some integrity to the part we have ' the hottie from Bring It On who all the teenage guys like'. I personally do not find her attractive and her part in the movie is no more than 'the damsel in distress when necessary to the plot' kind. She's such a stronger character in the comic book and it's been totally ignored here. James Franco as Harry Osborne was useless. I've seen more charismatic performances from furniture. Willem Dafoe was okay as the Green Goblin but some of his dialogue was real bad, it felt like rejected Skeletor jibes from the original He-Man show. He did provoke some sympathy and coped well with the inner-turmoil story but I could not help but think that someone else could have done it better. JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell were the only bright spots among the whole cast.27-year-old Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker. A 'boy' who is blessed with web-spinning capabilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip. You guessed it, this is another 'origins of' story. I HATE it when comic-book superhero movies feel the need to do this. Honestly, who DOESN'T know who Spiderman is or how he got his powers? The fact that Spiderman is so popular (as a franchise) is the only reason this tawdry-looking movie was a hit. I would have had so much more respect for it if it went straight to the action and didn't waste time setting things up. No superhero movie is willing to do this and it only proves even further that Spiderman was cooked up and packaged in board room meetings.
As a way of disguising the fact that the whole thing is no more than processed cheese, eccentric director Sam Raimi was hired to direct. Known for his cheap but whacky movies Raimi had never really done anything big budget before this. The result is a meretricious, mess of a movie that is all over the place. I honestly thought I had walked into some Power Rangers movie.The computer effects are, quite simply, hideous. Who are they honestly trying to fool with this stuff? It boggles the mind how they ended up with an Academy Award nomination. They are really, really bad. The Styrofoam shark in Jaws: The Revenge was more convincing.Danny Elfman cranks out YET ANOTHER superhero movie score for this 'un. It's flat, boring and unimpressive. Aunt May is way too old. The Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger. The direction is uncontrolled. It's got a poor cast. The story is nothing new or daring (check out the comic books for that). It's assembled by a boardroom committee, not crafted by people who care and it's just loud, dumb entertainment when Spiderman really should be much more.The only part I appreciated was the way they made Spiderman's web biological instead of manufactured. It just makes so much more sense this way. Though there are loads out there who disagree with me.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (I seriously think this film would have benefited from and deserved scope-widescreen but no luck) and it looks better than average. There are some color problems and it doesn't look too crisp. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is typically loud and thumping but it's nothing particularly dynamic. There are quite a few extras if you're really that much of a fan. As I couldn't care any less for this film I can't comment.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","CinemaSerf","3 September 2023","Tobey Maguire was always going to have a tough task revitalising this franchise - but I think he has done a decent job here. The geeky, shy, young ""Peter Parker"" bitten by a genetically-modified spider that endows him with superhuman powers, decides to use his newly-found prowess for good. Dressed only in a pair of loosely converted pyjamas, he polices the streets at night apprehending thugs and petty criminals whilst during the day he remains the butt of jokes and pranks at school - usually at the hands of school heart-throb/dim-wit ""Flash"" (Joe Manganiello). He is best friends with ""Harry"" (the handsome, but pretty ineffective James Franco) who is not only the son of mega-rich scientist ""Norman Osborn"" (Willem Dafoe) but who is also dating his own dream girl ""Mary Jane"" (Kirsten Dunst). When his board try to take the ""Osborn"" company away from him, Dafoe starts experimenting with drugs that transfer him from a megalomanic scientist into - well a megalomanic ""Green Goblin"" - and it falls to ""Spidey"" to save the city and, of course, get his gal. Maguire is engaging in this, he has a glint in his eye and he enters into the spirit of this light-hearted fantasy adventure well. The writing is good in places, if a little too earnest at times, and the visual effects work well. They don't overwhelm the acting - maybe because the spider skills are inherently a little less showy - and this allows the story to focus more on a few engaging characterisations. JK Simmons is good as newspaper editor ""Jameson"" and there are a few nice cameos scenes from Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as his uncle and aunt. Sam Raimi has kept the pace tight, there is plenty of action peppered with some humour, some ham from Dafoe and a decent amount of scary science to keep this moving along well for two hours.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","tfrizzell","26 June 2002","Very good superhero film that competes very well with the first two ""Superman"" films and the first ""Batman"" from 1989. High school senior Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bit one day at a museum by a genetically-enhanced spider and his super powers are born. Meanwhile the very wealthy Willem Dafoe has performed a risky experiment on himself at his research lab and turns himself into a crazed maniac, with super-human strength, who only cares about world domination. Of course there is also Spider-Man's love interest (Kirsten Dunst), his elderly uncle and aunt (Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris) and his best friend who is also Dafoe's only son (James Franco in another outstanding performance for the youngster who has unlimited potential). Franco appears to become much more important in upcoming ""Spider-Man"" films. Let's start predicting how many films the franchise will produce. 4 stars out of 5.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","Pjtaylor-96-138044","14 February 2018","Sure, at times 'Spider-Man (2002)' is a little cheesy and perhaps even border-line camp, but this is big-budget blockbuster film-making with flair. Sam Raimi's distinct directing style is present and appreciated, even if it is reined in a little. It brings to life a colourful comic-book world in a believable, entertaining way and it's much better than the washed-out, generic stuff we so often see nowadays. The piece can be melodramatic on occasion but it also isn't afraid to get dark, with some sequences actually being pretty brutal (I'll refer you to the final fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, whose defeat is wince-inducing to say the least) and highlighting the dangers of the occupation well, while never losing sight of the heart of the character. The flick is incredibly well-made and, for me, still holds up. It's a true highlight of the genre; a blast from start to finish. 9/10","6/10"
"Spider-Man","snoozejonc","18 April 2022","Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' is a strong origin movie for the famous superhero.The story packs quite a lot into its running time, with background stories to several characters whilst developing a fairly good confrontation between protagonist and antagonist.How Peter Parker becomes the titular hero is exceptionally well done and this transformation links well to themes of adolescence and transition into adulthood. The dialogue exchanges with his family are some of the standout moments for me.The scenes between Parker/Spidey and MJ are some of the best exchanges between romantically linked characters in the superhero genre. Both dialogue and visuals are wonderful, with Kirstin Dunst and Toby Maguire having great chemistry.For me the weakest aspect is the writing and design of the Green Goblin. Willem Dafoe, as always, gives a fantastic performance, and Sam Raimi makes the best out of the concept, but there is a pretty weak and rushed backstory and the costume does not work on screen. I do though like the surrogate father aspect of the character.I think the visual storytelling is strong, with great cinematography, editing and special effects. Some of it seems a bit cartoonish by today's standards but at the time of release all the slinging and swinging was groundbreaking imagery.","7/10"
"Spider-Man","KineticSeoul","12 June 2016","This is a superhero movie that didn't try to get all gritty, serious and full of twist and turns to make it a engaging superhero movie. Instead it's a friendly superhero movie that is just overall fun to watch. Plus there weren't many superhero movies like this, so the audiences were just blown away watching Spidey swing around New York. Yeah, the plot is generic and the CGI is outdated in today's standards but it was a great movie when it came out. I remember first seeing the trailer for this movie and was just amazed by it. Since at that time I have never seen anything like this, despite it leaning toward the cheesy side in today's standards. Spider-Man was my favorite superhero at that time. So as a kid I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end and wanted to see it again once it was finished. I am not sure if Tobey Maguire was the best choice for the role as Peter Parker. But he played his character as a likable and nice science nerd. Although not as snappy and taunting as Spider-Man but he was believable as a nerd with the heart of gold. This movie doesn't pull much punches, but it has enough of Spider- Man in it with a story-line that for the most part follows through. Despite it not being very accurate to the comics, it does carry on the essence of Spider-Man. I even liked the theme song, despite few very cheesy scores but the theme song by Danny Elfman is spot on. Overall this is a fun and friendly superhero movie worth checking out.8.4/10","7/10"
"Spider-Man","Robert_duder","8 May 2002","I was anxiously awaiting this movie. I expected high flying action, good fun, and a decent movie. What met me was three times that!! Sam Raimi blew me away with what is probably the best Super Hero film ever made. It wasn't dark, but it wasn't light-hearted, the phenomenal thing about this movie was that it was real. The world around Peter Parker and Spiderman was our world. Raimi did not ""Comic Book-ize"" the world like they did for Batman or Superman movies. It was our world, it was like looking right out our front windows. Tobey Maquire was the ideal choice for the run of the mill kid, who is picked on and misunderstood and pining for the beautiful popular girl. The popular girl is played by Kirsten Dunst who we know can look like a goddess or in this case, truly, actually look like the girl next door. Raimi is brilliant...this movie was filmed in what I call real-life. He took a fantasy about a kid bit by a spider and brought Spiderman into the real world. Maguire and Dunst both look like the average kid and I don't think a lot of make up was used to cover their imperfections and blemishes. Instead Raimi allowed them to look like human beings. The story for Spiderman follows true to the comics. Peter Parker, while on a school trip is bit by a genetically altered Spider and wakes up the next morning, stronger, faster, healthier, with enhanced...well everything. Immediately thinking of his own personal gain, Parker uses his powers to take on a wrestler and when he's cheated by the wrestling promoter he gets even by allowing a crook to rob the Promoter. Moments later Parker discovers that by letting that crook get away his beloved Uncle Ben (who is like Peter's father) is murdered by that crook. From that moment on Peter Parker vows to fight injustice with the words of Uncle Ben ringing in his ears...""with great power, comes great responsibility."" This movie spans the course of several years in Peter's life and Raimi covers that whole time without making us feel rushed or crammed together...instead it flows together, and leaves us riveted to the screen. Franco and Dafoe play Father and Son, and Dafoe during a experiment loses his mind and his personality is split into the Green Goblin who uses top secret Military technology to destroy the city. Dafoe is just brilliant as the evil Green Goblin and his alter ego, the suave Dr. Osbourn. Franco who plays Harry Osbourn, Peter Parker's best friend looks and acts so much like Dafoe that they are the most believable father and son in movies in years. The story is so depthy and full of emotion and action. The computer generated effects at times are almost cartoonish which I always HATE but Raimi uses enough effects mixed with live action that it flows well and you don't notice the computerized Spiderman nearly as much. Spiderman himself is also amazing as he should be. The costume and Maquire playing him make him the greatest hero on screen in years. This movie is so fantastic because it is so SIMPLISTIC!! It's like you're watching right down town Hometown. I honestly don't know if Raimi could pull off a sequel with the same quite subtlty and simplicity but I would love to see him try. I would pay the 10 bucks to not only see a sequel but I would even love to see Spiderman again. The running time was the better part of two hours and it was the perfect length. Everything about this movie was just enough of everything. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! This is the great Blockbuster for the summer!!! 9/10","10/10"

"Spider-Man","IonicBreezeMachine","31 December 2021","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy and meek high schooler who is often the object of casual abuse and teasing by most of the school. Peter has a crush on ""girl next door"" Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but doesn't act on it out of fear of rejection leaving his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), to develop a relationship with her instead. On a field trip to Columbia University Peter is bitten by a genetically engineered Spider and gradually manifests physical changes such as enhanced strength, heightened alertness, ability to cling to walls and ceilings, and shooting webbing from his wrists. Peter initially uses these powers for personal gain, but following the death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) that Peter feels indirectly responsible for, Peter becomes the masked hero Spider-Man while also attending classes and working part time taking pictures of his Spider-Man persona to sell to abrasive tabloid newspaper owner/editor J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) to help alleviate the financial strain on his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). Meanwhile, Harry's father, scientist/CEO Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) under intense pressure from imminent loss of a lucrative military contract to a rival company decides to test a dangerous enhancement formula on himself which works but unleashes a dangerous split personality in the Green Goblin.One of Marvel Comics most iconic and beloved characters, Spider-Man has seen various incarnations in other media since the 60s with notable animated and live action adaptations on TV. Attempts had been made at bringing the character to feature film since the 80s with attempts by Roger Corman, Cannon Films, Carolco, James Cameron and even MGM being stalled for various reasons be they creative or financial until the rights were eventually obtained by Sony following an agreement with MGM regarding disputed rights to the James Bond novels Casino Royale and Thunderball (long story there). A number of directors were considered including Tim Burton, David Fincher, Michael Bay and many others until Amy Pascal's championed pick of Sam Raimi was hired primarily from his enthusiasm for the character stemming from the directors childhood fandom having read the early Stan Lee and Steve Ditko era comics of the Silver Age. When the movie was released in May of 2002, Spider-Man became the first film to have a $100 million opening weekend and made over $800 million worldwide becoming the third highest grossing film of 2002 with only Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets beating it. The movie is seen as one of the first major events that ushered in most what defined the early 2000s take on the Superhero genre (along with the X-Men movies) and while the film has definitely aged, it's a charming film in its own right that shows a real love for the character.Tobey Maguire is really good playing Peter Parker with his nerd mannerisms being reminiscent of Rick Moranis' take on Seymour from Little Shop of Horrors in terms of delivery. While it's admittedly a broad performance it works well for the type of world and tone the movie strives towards (more on that). Kirsten Dunst is also good as Peter's friend/love interest Mary Jane Watson as is James Franco as Peter's best friend harry Osborn and the three play off each other quite nicely giving a strong sense of camaraderie to their interactions. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are also good as Uncle Ben and Aunt May respectively with some really good moments between Maguire and Robertson and Harris giving us that warm familial dynamic that resonates strongly with us. Willem Dafoe is also quite good as Norman Osborn and is quite chilling in his normal guise as a shrewd and aggressive businessman but is also bursting with scenery chewing enthusiasm when adopting the Green Goblin persona. But by far the best part bar none is J. K. Simmons as Daily Bugle editor/owner J. Jonah Jameson whose fast talking tightly wound delivery and persona make him one of the most endearing and entertaining staples of the movie.Because the technology used for Spider-Man swinging through the city and performing elaborate acrobatics was still in its infancy, the movie's effects have not aged gracefully and there's a number of scenes that are often rubbery or lacking in weight. The visual effects for the movie were handled by industry veteran John Dykstra who helped bring the space battles of Star Wars to life so he's a quality talent to have on a project likes this, but the technology and effects were very rough around this time with Raimi mostly used to practical effects rather than digital ones and the effects for Spider-Man were a level above what had been attempted with CGI especially regarding superhero movies. There's also some noticeable gaffes in editing that make flow confusing or make a scene feel sloppy but these are mostly forgivable. But the biggest sticking point will be the movie's tone and delivery which has a goofiness to it because the movie maybe adheres a little too closely to the comics it bases itself upon. While the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era of Spider-Man comics are regarded as classics for good reason, they were also written in the 1960s during the Silver Age of comics wherein storytelling was very compressed and dialogue was overly blunt and direct lacking in polish or nuance. The story structure of Spider-Man is perfect with the pacing well done with everything established efficiently and effectively while telling a satisfying story with a strong emotional core. However the dialogue is filled with little ""quirks"" that feel like they're taking that Silver Age style of writing that comes off as a little eye brow raising especially in modern day and live action.Spider-Man may be a little dated in some aspects, but it's a film that exudes passion and love for the characters and the comic with clear effort made by people who believed in the core of Spider-Man. The movie served as the template for many superhero films of the early 2000s and its influence can still be felt on later superhero movies thanks to the foundations established by Sam Raimi and Spider-Man.","10/10"

"Spider-Man","leplatypus","1 January 2005","Reviewing Spiderman makes me learn about a few simple rules about critics: # 1. Critics are subjective, because it is the result between The story and Our story. So Spiderman being my first big moment of entertainment in my childhood, its movie could only be viewed with tolerant eyes.# 2. Adaptation is a success if the ¬´spirit¬ª of the work has been understands. Thus, the pleasure for the fan is to live again this spirit, in front of a lot of little differences from the original work. In Spiderman, the spirit is indeed there: a loyal nephew and friend, a torn soul between his dreams and his duties. And the cast embodies perfectly the characters.# 3. The key to evaluate an adaptation is that not only the fans loves it but also the new comers. And I have got 2 friends who likes Spiderman whereas they didn't even read comics !!!! So, if the Xmen is too complicated for the non-initiated, if Superman is too perfect, if Batman is too dark, Spidey is really the Number one of the super heroes in comics and in movies!!!","8/10"

It's a to the point action super hero film that is done right, which sadly can't be said for similar films now which have to be too long, too convoluted, too sci-fi & just passionless!The story is pretty good & straight forward & the villain is also a great too! The pacing is good for a nearly 2 hour film which does what it sets out to be! Tobey McGuire knocks it pout the park as Peter Parker & is by far my favourite spider man to date!The film has some sad moments in it too which are balanced out by the action & romance scenes with Mary-Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst & the villain Green Goblin, played by William Dafoe! Then there's the comedy sequences with J. Jonah Jameson played by J. K Simmons! Then of course you have Cliff Robertson & Rosemary Harris playing Ben Parker & Aunt May along with Peters' best mate Harry Osborn being played by James Franco!Overall, it's a truly classic early 00's super hero action film which beats all others in this day & age 20 years on! Honestly, this raised the bar & couldn't be matched since!8/10.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","Quinoa1984","25 May 2002","Sam Raimi to me didn't seem like not the wrong choice to direct Spiderman but the un-needed choice- at least at first. The screenplay would've fit any director whose a fan of Spiderman since it entails most of the clich√©s and knowledge that goes into a comic book adaptation. But after repeat viewings, and seeing Spider-Man 2 more as well, I've grown some more respect for a picture that I thought of at first as being as nothing more than something of Raimi going 'mega Hollywood' in telling the origin of Peter Parker. In this first installment, he fights the Green Goblin played by Willem Dafoe in a dual personality type role with Norman Osborne. Watching the movie, I liked the set up parts and the connection between Maguire and Dunst is there, but on the outset when I saw it early on I was not so much a fan of the action sequences, which compared to Raimi's grittier (and funnier to be sure) Evil Dead movies, are so fabricated they might as well have credited Pixar as one of the production companies. The work though shows a little better once settled further into the Parker saga, and the real skills come through better. And compared to others that have come out in more recent years, it is exciting in ways other action set pieces from other comic book movies aren't. I even dig the performances more too, especially Willem Dafoe as Osbourne/Green Goblin, who puts as much gnarly relish into his performance that it ranks up there with his best work. Maybe part of it too is accepting Maguire as Parker/Spiderman, as he has an awkwardness early on that's uncanny. But it fits, and it perhaps grows in the sequel(s), and seeing it again I appreciate what he's doing in the character. In short, it's fun, and that's all we can really ask for. B+","10/10"
"Spider-Man","moonspinner55","27 August 2002","I know popcorn-epics like ""Spider-Man"" can't dwell over every little detail, but director Sam Raimi is so hectic and insistent on pushing this thing along, he loses the narrative punch in the F/X muddle. The movie is a big, loud, dumb entertainment, colorful on a certain level and lots of fun at the beginning--revealing a sneaky sense of humor--yet it becomes more staid and familiar as it progresses. Yes, Spider-Man is a super-hero and we need to see him using his powers for the good of the nation, but Raimi loses the beguiling magic inherent at the beginning while constantly pushing forward with 'bigger and better' ideas. The obligatory hammy performances are here, but Tobey Maguire is curiously low-keyed and oddly charming in the lead. **1/2 from ****","8/10"
"Spider-Man","MinorityReporter","12 August 2005","Being an avid fan of the comic book I really looked forward to this movie and for a long time I convinced myself that I liked the film. However, after a long time of self denial I bought the Spider-Man DVD and I saw the film for what it truly was. A disappointment. The magic from the comic books had evaporated.The acting in the film is a mixed bag. Tobey Maguire is well cast but his overall acting and presence isn't very good. He does the nerd part very well but when it comes to being a super hero he falls short. Spider-Man was always a complex character with great internal struggles but the film medium doesn't convey this very well because we don't get the inner monologue that Spider-Man is so well known for. He therefore has to act with facial expressions and body language. Tobey has a pretty well defined body language but his facial expressions are somewhat lacking. Also the fact that he is wearing the Spider-Man suit in many scenes prevent us from clearly reading what is going on in his head at the moment. Kirsten Dunst is just miscast. She is a horrible actress with zero talent and no resemblance with the character she plays making her performance utterly unbelievable. Willem Dafoe is usually a brilliant actor but in Spider-Man he seems to have dumbed down quite a bit and although his schizophrenic scenes are pretty interesting they do not cover for the fact that this is Dafoe's most mediocre performance in years. James Franco who plays Harry Osborn is remarkably boring in his performance. His voice never seems to change making him a young Keanu Reeves. The most interesting and well cast actor is J.K. Simmons who plays J. Jonah Jameson and if there was ever a guy who looked like the character he is meant to play it is Simmons. This is in both looks, voice and presence.The overall effects in the movie are undoubtedly very good and this makes the action sequences seem more believable. Spider-Man was nominated for an Oscar in the effects department but deservedly the Oscar went to The Fellowship of the Ring because while the effects are good they are far from brilliant. I will even go as far as to say that the only really good effects scene is the one at the very end where Spider-Man swings through the city. This scene, however, almost saves the film because it is brilliant and it is the only scene I can watch again and again.Danny Elfman's score is very good and it really suiting for a super hero movie. It really shows that Elfman has done a super hero movie score before. I am of course referring to Batman which is undoubtedly one of the best scores ever and you can certainly feel that Elfman used some of the experiences from that film in Spider-Man. The score has an epic feel to it that suits the film very well. The music is beyond reproach.Where the film fails is in the fact that it is too proper and it feels too much like it was adapted for kids which is in my opinion a mistake because the film had tremendous potential but it seems wasted because it never really becomes an adult film. Also the ending on the bridge is based on a well known story in the Spider-Man mythology where Spider-Man's first love Gwen Stacy dies in Spider-Man's battle with Green Goblin. I think they should have brought on Gwen Stacy for the first film and then introduced Mary Jan in the second movie. because it would have given Spider-Man a greater sense of loss and a better reason to hate Green Goblin if his first love had died at his hands but instead Raimi plays it safe and has Spider-Man save both the children in the lift and Mary Jane. It just seems too stupid.All in all Spider-Man was not the movie I was hoping for. I expected the best film ever and it certainly didn't deliver. Having said that and having seen the film a couple of times on DVD now I have grown to appreciate it a bit more. My primary issue with the film is that seems that the film wasn't directed for the fans of the character who expected a better adaptation but instead the film becomes a main stream Blockbuster with a wide range which isn't necessarily a bad thing but being a hardcore Spider-Man fan I would have liked to see a more adult film. Spider-Man is a good effort though and the effects alone deserve to be watched.7/10","8/10"

"Spider-Man","richard.fuller1","2 June 2002","My brothers and I never could figure out why so much was changed for the Spiderman tv show back in the seventies. Why does it seem to take a good forty years before an at least honest, faithful version to the original tale can be accomplished?Yes, some things were changed from the comic book, such as Mary Jane Watson and Flash did not go to the science exhibit (Mary Jane wasn't even in the origin back in '62) and Peter didn't create his web shooters, but now shot them straight from his hands. The wrestling match, crook at the elevator and Uncle Ben's death were all incredibly condensed together. As my brother put it, it was 200 comic book issues in one movie. But changes do take place for movies (it will be very amusing for adults to explain why Billy Dee Williams turns into Tommy Lee Jones in the Batman movies).A movie is only capable of showing so much before it becomes too long. Aunt May and J. Jonah Jameson had both been terrorized by villians, so naturally they were each attacked by the Goblin, staying true to the comic books in that regard. Major kudos to the man, J. K. Simmons, for his depiction of J. JOnah Jameson. Peter Parker became Spiderman in high school, so I had no problem with him being young again. If he aged naturally in the comic book, he would be ready for retirement now. Already the Green Goblin's arrival at the banquet is being compared to the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz. And keep an eye out for an elderly gentleman with a white moustache and glasses in crowd shots with a small girl. It's none other than Stan ""the Man"" Lee himself.The movie itself made for a nice teen hero flick, the ending as to what Peter was exactly trying to say was vague (I got the impression it was striving for a Bill Bixby/HUlk bit), but this was a good flick. As long as the upcoming Daredevil and Hulk movies remain true to the origins too, there should be no problem there, but I don't see how Dr. Banner is gonna have his nuclear testing go awry when Rick Jones shows up on the field.","8/10"

Their chemistry as Peter Parker and Mary-Jane Watson jumps off the screen it's that good.

I feel sorry for Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland having to follow in Maguire's footsteps.James Franco's scenes were good, but he was sparingly used as Harry Osborn in this instalment, though the final scene suggests this will change.

"Spider-Man","alexanderdavies-99382","1 July 2017","This was the film that proved an adaptation of a ""Marvel Comic"" superhero could be made. This first ""Spiderman"" film was the first of its kind and set the course for all future superhero movies. There is a story that actually holds the film together and backed by some good dialogue, good directing and pretty good acting. Where better than to begin with the origins of Spiderman? As has been depicted many times, high school student Peter Parker is bitten by a spider that just happens to be radioactive during a guided tour of a New York science museum. Initially overcome by his newly acquired superpowers, Parker attempts to cash in by appearing as a wrestler and on prime time television. After all this is met with failure, disaster strikes as Parkers Uncle Ben is murdered in cold blood by a thief. Cliff Robertson was brilliantly cast as the uncle. The story doesn't just revolve around Spiderman/Peter Parker though. Elsewhere in the film, business tycoon and inventor Norman Osborn (well played by Willam Defoe), suffers from an accident in his own laboratory after an experiment goes wrong. Thus the Green Goblin is unleashed. I was a bit disappointed with the costume for the Green Goblin, it held none of the appeal or chilling factor that the comic books had. Peter Parker struggles with his growing feelings for the girl that he has liked since childhood - Mary Jane Watson. The task of expressing his feelings has been rendered even more difficult on account of his crime- fighting alter ego. Toby Maguire is pretty good in the main role but I wouldn't exactly call him a heavyweight actor. He can't project the rugged look that action men need. Even so, he fits the bill. The scenes that show Spiderman web-slinging his way around New York look great and the CGI serves its purpose without compromising the story. A great film and its box office success is well deserved.","7/10"

Great kickstart for the entire series and all the spin offs to come.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","MovieAddict2016","18 July 2002","I just wrote a LONG comment on spider man, and I lost it, so I'm making this one short. Spider-Man was excellent. I've been thinking they should make it for YEARS. It compliments the comic very nicely, without the darkness some other comic-to-movie films have had in the past(Batman sequels -I thought the first Batman with M. Keaton had the perfect dark tough of Gotham City, so I do like the darkness in Bman 1). Tobey Maguire, I had my doubts about as Spider Man at first, but now I realize it great for the role. As was everyone else(hats off to Willem Defoe, perfectly portryaying the ever creepy Green Goblin). Although sometimes the graphics were a bit corny, and at a few scenes, I got a Power Rangers feeling when they weren't using graphics in a scene between G-goblin and Spiderman, just looking at them in the cheesy suits looked like something out of Power Rangers. However, this happened noly around 2 times in the film, and it wasn't a biggy. I loved Spider-Man and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can snatch it in my web.4/5 stars-MovieCritc2003","8/10"
"Spider-Man","PCC0921","22 July 2022","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), like Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000), owes a lot to Tim Burton's Batman (1989). Those reasons are obvious and don't even need to be pointed out, but also for music composer Danny Elfman. Danny Elfman revolutionized the comic book soundtrack when he did Batman (1989). At the same time, the Simpsons (1989-present), started airing on FOX, with his legendary theme song, thus sealing his style of music into the pop-culture conscience. It doesn't stop there. In the 13 years between the two movies, Elfman would eventually do Edward Scissorhands (1990), Mission Impossible (1996) and Men in Black (1997), just to name a few. It is Elfman's music that catapults this film right out of the gate with the beginning credits, totally channeling, but not copying, the music from Batman (1989).From there, Sam Raimi finally gives web-head his cinematic due, by showing the world, that a man can walk on walls. With a huge budget, an excellent cast and the best special effects available for 2002, this film became part of the new millennium's superhero, comic book, film momentum, that paved the way to the MCU of today. This film appealed to the general public, as well as the comic book fans. Sam Raimi had captured a spark, which would spread even more in the sequel, Spider-Man 2 (2004), which is even better than this one. This film should still be viewed first, always, before watching the sequel. It needs to be, because of its importance to film. Not just for its importance to the comic-book film, but it also played a huge part in film history as well. You can skip Spider-Man 3 (2007), if you want to.8.7 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","NijazBaBs","2 February 2021","I am amazed one more time. Nothing less than as a kid. Everything is realistic regarding graphics. Much higher quality than some of the best and newest movies, yet so old. Emotional, deep, interesting even from beginning, motivational, inspirational. It motivates me to save the world, to improve myself, to watch other sequels and similar movies. Good presence of people, locations, buildings, vehicles, police... Except the superhero and scifi part everything is so real. The love, the science, the friendship, the family, the business. Only better scifi movies I've seen are ones based more on science and less on fiction and heroism. But considering that this is based on comics and for kids, that is acceptable. Good actors too. Maybe I would prefer bit shorter time length.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","dasa108","18 December 2022","Sam Raimi is a film virtuoso. Able to deliver entertaining movies on a low budget, it made the proper transition to big-budget movies successfully. This film honors the best tradition of the arachnid hero and allows a faithful and adequate rendition of the comic to be offered on screen. All the characters resemble the ones we knew in our childhood and the cast was wisely selected. For this reason this film represents the best adaptation to the cinema of Spiderman and everything that happened after began as a slow decline until becoming a total debacle in recent times. Mr. Dafoe is a masterful Green Goblin and his performance is obviously the best in the movie. He is good, very good.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","ivo-cobra8","19 October 2015","Spider-Man (2002) it is an epic Sam Raimi Action superhero flick! This first Spider-Man film become my favorite film of superheroes. I remember when this film come out in 2002 and become a huge hit that year. I kept watching and listening video spot Hero - by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott. I wanted to see so badly that film that I bag my neighbor to get me that film and he did I watch it on Computer the same year that this film come out. And I love this film I love it not as much as I love Spider-Man 2 (2004) and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) but I still love it. I am glad they made this film in 2002 and Sam Raimi directed this film. I love it and it is my favorite best Spider-Man movie yet. I watch it in 2003 my mom bought me VHS when she was still alive, she isn't anymore it remind on my teenage years in high school. I watch it yesterday and I still can't get bored with it. Green Goblin was the best villain ever in Spider-Man I love him. The Amazing Spider-Man was really awesome I love it so much. I love them all Spider-Man movies.I still find the original enjoyable, but I'm not nearly as forgiving of its flaws as some are. I think Spider-Man 2 was great, but the first one really is... crappy. I get it that it appeals to people by ""capturing that exciting comic book feeling"", but that isn't enough for me to say it's a good movie. The new movie has stronger emotion and had more weight to it, and I was RELIEVED that the ending was different. Yeah, it was a selfish thing on the new Peter's part, but I forgive him for it. A marvel movie shouldn't really go to much into the origin unless it relates to the story of the rest of the movie, if the origin is connected to the actual plot, then it's appropriate to show it, if not, then it's something you can get done and over with in the first 10 minutes or so, this movie is a prime example, the goblin wasn't related to the origin, so it went by quickly.I love The Amazing Spider-Man a lot, but my favorite movie will always be Spider-Man 2002 I grow up with that movie. Spider-Man 2002 is much much better for me then The Amazing Spider-Man is. Fans who compare TASM over SM are just kids and maybe they watch TASM before they even hear about SM or who knows why they do that, everyone has their own opinion. I love Spider-Man 2002 equal the way I love The Amazing Spider-Man:P That is my opinion .Average teenager Peter Parker is transformed into an extraordinary super hero after he is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. When his beloved uncle is savagely murdered during a robbery, young Peter vows to use his powers to avenge his death. Deeming himself ""Spider-Man,"" he sets about ridding the streets of crime, bringing him into conflict with malevolent super-villain ""Green Goblin."" The action, acting and pacing are excellent and the movie manages to action, romance, drama and comedy all into one great package! Spidey has always been one of my favorites. I was surprised that Raimi was given the role of director with this film, considering his only real claim to fame is the Evil Dead series before this, but his direction here is very well done. The acting is very good. Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Everyone fits into their role well -- great cast. The special-effects are okay. Raimi can't seem to decide what scene should be CGI or which should be wires when it comes to the antics of Spidey saving the day or duking it out with a villain ""Green Goblin"".The musical score was only part of the success for this movie thanks to Danny Elfman. The special effects were mind blowing for me to see Spiderman swing from high buildings to catch the bad guys. This movie is worth every penny and it is worth owning. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson did a wonderful performance of her role. I seriously love the actress, I am a huge fan of her and I always was. She did played the character well, like the role of Mary Jane Watson was written on her skin.""With great power comes great responsibility."" Bottom of line I love this film and the fighting scenes between Spidey and The Green Goblin was awesome. CGI in this film wasn't bad It was great. The whole film was huge Entertainment.Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a high school student living in New York, who turns to crime fighting after developing spider-like super powers. Spider-Man also stars Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn (a.k.a. the Green Goblin), Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary Jane Watson, and James Franco as his best friend Harry Osborn.9/10 Score: A- Studio: Columbia Pictures Corporation, Marvel Enterprises, Laura Ziskin Productions Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, J.K.

"Spider-Man","alindsayal","23 December 2021","With Spider-Man: No Way Home set to come to cinemas in a couple of weeks and the reveal that characters from previous Spider-Man films will be a part of it, I thought I should go back and watch previous Spider-Man films and here is my review for the first Spider-Man film.Main Character
Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man here and he just fits the role really well and is really fun to watch. You see him grow from this really uncomfortable nervous nerd to this confident super hero and it is executed really well. Maguire, brings emotion and humour to the role to really create this interesting and sympathetic hero that you can really care about.Supporting Characters
Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin and he was literally born to play this role. He nails the duplicity of the role and the insanity that comes across from the Goblin, the costume isn't great but he is a very memorable villain for sure. Kirsten Dunst plays MJ and she does her job to the best of her abilities. The character isn't written very well and is basically a damsel in distress but I thought she had good chemistry with Maguire and it just about worked in this film. Similar with James Franco as Harry Osbourne, he isn't given that much to do but he is decent when on screen despite some of the plotting for the character not being that great in this film. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are both very good as Uncle Ben and Aunt May and you see the impact they have on Peter's life and how it moulds him as a superhero. Onto the show stealer which is JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson, when people ask what is the greatest casting in a comic book film he is the answer I give. He hasn't got a huge role in the film but when he is on screen he knocks it out of the park and is literally the only person who could ever play this role in live action.Story
The story is good, I think it is a really effective origin story for Spider-Man and really gets us invested in the character and moves at a quick enough pace that it never feels dull or slow. But this film does suffer a bit in their handling of some of the subplots, like the whole romance story. The characters of MJ and Harry are really underdeveloped and made to come across as bad people which doesn't make sense when the performers are really trying their best.Script
The script is effective, it is funny at times and the drama mostly works. You care about the main conflict and Spider-Man which is the most important part of the film. But there is no denying that some of the writing is incredibly cheesy and feels dated, making me cringe. Plus as I said some of the story elements just don't work.Style
The style of the film still holds up. The action scenes are very exciting and cinematic, I may have complained about the Goblin costume but the Spider-Man costume is amazing and so iconic. The film is paced really well and kept me interested and enjoyed throughout.Overall
Overall, Spider-Man is a great film. It is one of the superhero films that started the craze of these type of films and it still holds up really well.Rating - 8/10.","7/10"
"Spider-Man","lark40","5 January 2022","I saw this in the cinema I didn't like the way raimi made it at first the thinking man action superhero but it has grown on me over the years as we meet Peter Parker played by tobey mcguire he is the definitive spidey he is an ordinary guy who lives with his aunt may and uncle Ben a working class hero and he lives next door to the girl of his dreams mj. On a school trip he goes to a science lab where spiders are genetically made one bites him as he documents and pictures mj he develops unusual characteristics of spiders skills and acrobatic strength and spider senses and Web spinning but as his formative training with designs of his suit he wrestles to gain money and keep an eye on mj when she gets into hassle he battle thugs and does the best unique kiss with mj upside down in the rain

"Spider-Man","dk777","12 February 2024","One of those films that managed to faithfully convey the characters from the comics.The casting is excellent, the characters resemble their counterparts from the comics, not only physically, but also in personality.Of course, it is never possible to transfer comics to film exactly the same, but this is an example of how it is possible to transfer characters from comics to the big screen almost identically.We follow Peter Parker and how he transformed from a scared boy into Spiderman. Tobey Maguire is excellent in the role of Peter Parker, but the rest of the actors are also great.The casting was excellent, the actors fit their roles and managed to portray the characters. Willem Dafoe is great as the Green Goblin, but J. K. Simmons stole the show with his unforgettable interpretation of J. Jonah Jameson. The direction is excellent.The film is really fun, with several good action sequences and does not burden the viewer with unimportant things, but wants to entertain him.Sam Raimi is a great director and he proves it here once again.This is a movie that wants to entertain us and succeeds in doing so.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","SkullScreamerReturns","27 September 2021","I liked this movie in the early 2000s and was surprised it's still very good this day. Especially, when the Avengers-related MCU movies have become a pain for me to watch it surprised me even more that Marvel movies used to be this good.There is of course action in this kind of movie, but the strength lies in the characters. It's a very good drama and love story. Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Mary Jane, Willem Dafoe is an excellent villain, the newspaper guy Jameson looks like just from a comic book, and, well, the whole movie with its beautifully framed shots and vibrant colors looks what a comic book movie should look like. Tobey Maguire is a good Peter Parker and makes a good dynamic with Dunst (though I also like Andrew Garfield's version of Parker a lot).Special effects are quite good. There is some cgi but it's not overused, and generally the movie looks good.One of the best superhero films? See it!","8/10"

"Spider-Man","claszdsburrogato","17 June 2023","If there's a movie that has the ability to collect all the essence of a character's comics and transport it to live action, that movie is Spider-Man (2002). It became a great classic of the superhero subgenre and is still a great movie today. Some things are dated and don't work as much as they used to and others weren't as good at the time, like the Green Goblin costume. However, this does not hinder anything, because the characters and the story are incredible and charming. Every frame of the film looks like it's been ripped from a comic book page. This film deserves to be forever a great classic.","10/10"

He was my favorite part of the Electric Company when I was a kid. This was the best adaptation of the source material to have come out. They expertly captured the spirit that the hero embodies, including his quick whit.

"Spider-Man","Col-3","27 May 2002","Rarely do I feel as misanthropic as I do when I get home from a movie as bad as this one, and as popular as this one. Sure, it will fade by morning, but until then my dreams will be haunted be the ludicrous villainy, predictable action and motherhood-and-apple-pie cheese of Spider-Man. While Tobey MacGuire was an excellent choice, the whole movie was just lurching through the motions; there were no surprises, the whole thing felt paper-thin. Many cliches were strung together to lengthen the otherwise trivially simple plot - geek getting his own back against high-school bully, agonizing death scenes, and much puppy-dog romance which everyone else seems to have found adorable. I found it simply tedious. While the movie had some nice effects, it is, as one might expect, just another entry in a sad list of superhero flicks that are more or less indistinguishable from one another. Let me give you a hint: the good guy wins.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","bob the moo","27 June 2002","Peter Parker is a dorky kid going through adolescent changes.  However in his case they are changes brought on by a bite from a genetically enhanced spider.  In a difficult lesson Peter learns that his gifts bring him responsibility.  Meanwhile the father of Peter's friend, Norman Osborn is developing a hover platform and strength enhancers for the military.  When he faces losing the contract he takes the treatment himself ¬ñ creating the Green Goblin, who wrecks havoc on the city ¬ñ with only Spiderman able to stop him.With some comic adaptations the end results have been disappointing (The Punisher, most of the Batman films etc), however here this is one of recent successes including X-Men.  It may well make changes to the original legend but it's really only things that'll annoy geeks who spend too much time on the internet arguing over whether Iron Man could beat Batman in a fight! The plot has enough to it to distract.  The creation of both Spiderman and the Green Goblin are enjoyable over the first half.  Peter's `experimentations' in his bedroom can be taken any way you want it!  However when the Goblin and Spiderman being to battle it is nice and simple ¬ñ there's no plot to take over the city, no plan to freeze the world or any silliness like that, it's a simple battle between a good guy and a baddie.In many bits the effects are surprisingly poor ¬ñ not as bad as I thought they might be, but still bad.  There are many bits where the computer characters don't look real ¬ñ not just in terms of their movement but more in terms of their looks, in places it doesn't even look as good as the computer game.  Having said that, for most they blend effects and live action together well.  The Goblin's suit doesn't match the comic and it looks a bit like something out of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, but they use it well although one scene with him does look like something out of Godzilla!The cast are actually what makes the film.  Maguire makes a good Spiderman ¬ñ he's a goofy looking kid and a good actor.  He doesn't have Spiderman's one-liners but he makes a good character, even when he's behind the mask he manages to bring a certain amount of humanity to the role.  Dafoe ran the risk of losing credibility by being a serious actor who goes for the money and get dressed up in a monster suit for a FX movie!  However he is actually really good ¬ñ you almost forget how silly it could have been.  There are some really good scenes where he's facing his alter ego and it could have been daft but he carries it off ¬ñ shows what a good actor he is.  Dunst is good ¬ñ she really isn't much more than a Louis Lane character but she is good and her character has a good background.  My favourite character is J. Jonah Jameson ¬ñ he's exactly like he's meant to be and is very funny in a hyper sort of way!  The actor who plays him (J.K. Simmons) is probably best known for his role in Oz, the HBO series.  If you know him in that, then it's weird to see the actor who plays, well, basically the Devil, playing this type of thing ¬ñ but hats off, he's really good and looks just like the comic book.  The support cast has some famous faces ¬ñ like Bill Nunn, Ted Rami and a few others, and it's nice to see Rami's favourite actor Bruce Campbell in a small role.Overall I must admit I expected to be let down but, apart from dodgy effects this is a good summer movie.  Plenty of good action and fun but also good performances all round.  The only problem I see is that half this film was filled up with creating the characters ¬ñ what will part 2 do to fill that time?","10/10"

The characters were pretty good and they went around in a circle showcasing them in unique and proper ways. They had good music composition and sound choices. The dialogue was not bad or good it felt standard. The visuals werent that bad or good it was alright though not impressed.Memorable: Yes . Rewatchable: No","10/10"
"Spider-Man","TechnicallyTwisted","7 May 2002","This is not the best comic book movie ever.  That honor still belongs to the first Superman.  I enjoyed the Peter Parker scenes, but felt let down by the action, and Danny Elfman's terrible score.  I didn't hate the film, there were moments that were quite good.  Like when Peter is first discovering his Spidey abilities.  But it didn't have that same mythic quality that the first Superman had.  The actors did there best with the script.  J.J Jameson was real good, but the story felt pedestrian.  The rivalry between the Goblin and Spider-Man wasn't developed enough.  I give the film a 7 because it was better than most of the summer blockbusters last year.  (Planet of the Apes anyone?)  But it was missing certain qualities that would have elevated it to classic status.  Go see it and decide for yourself though.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","NightmareOnElmStreetFan","8 February 2019","One of the most decent electrifying essential superhero's, the best origin story about a superhero Spider-Man - my personal favorite comic book superhero action movie. Spider-Man (2002) become a blockbuster hit in 2002 when it come out. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. I known Spider-Man character superhero from animated TV series of the 90's. As a teeneger I saw music video Hero by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott and I rushed to see this movie right away. A neighbor friend got me the movie on his comp and it was an adrenaline rush. This movie become my favorite superhero film of all time it still is. It defines my childhood. I watch this movie the first time as a teenager in a high school, it is a teenager dream.Spider-Man takes cues from Superman: The Movie (1978) which deals about superhero Clark Kent how he become Superman. Here is the origin story of how Peter Parker become from a shy nerdy teenager later photographer to a ultimate superhero of all time his alter ego Spider-Man. Just like Richard Donner directed the first Superman the excitement is here from MARVEL screenplay David Koepp created by Stan Lee R.I.P and Steve Ditko. I used to had VHS tape my mom bought me a present this movie, when I was a teen for my gradation day. I used too had the poster, but I don't know where that poster went too. I love this film to death my number 1 favorite Spider-Man film is Spider-Man: Homecoming but this Spider-Man the first in the trilogy is my second personal favorite Spidey film. I enjoy beautiful music score for Spider-Man from Danny Elfman, who also worked on a 1989 Batman music score. I love that music score to death.Directed was by Sam Raimi from ""The Evil Dead"" trilogy and stars: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco.The first film has humor, fast pacing, a lot of action, good sci-fi effects beautiful cast, good likable leads and good FX special effects. I love the CGI effects and custom for Spider-Man and Green Goblin. I heard that thieves stole Spider-Man suits on the production set that the crew make them for this movie. Mostly I understand the character Peter Parker it has deep sense meaning to the character. The first half deals more about how Peter is learning about his super ability when he gets bit by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". First he wants to impressed his neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the eternity love of his life by buying a car and he goes in to wrestling match to earn money. First half he was more selfish, shy and geek and he lost by a car jacking his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and when he didn't safe that carjacker who killed his uncle he was selfish. But he got redemption later in the movie and he learns that is not what he does. Spider-Man saved more kids than The Amazing Spider-Man Andrew Garfield did. Spider-Man saves Marry Jane. He saves a baby from a burning building. Spider-Man saves a trolley car on the Roosevelt Bridge witch are kids in it. On a parade in which Green Goblin starts attacking Spider-Man saves a kid when a balloon is falling at him, almost crushing him.You have action sequences in which Green Goblin on jet glider fires on Spider-Man rockets, and bullets, slugs at him but misses. He throws pumpkin bombs on the Board of Directors killing them, he throws razor bats on Spider-Man and cuts him. I love the fight sequence between Spider-Man and Green Goblin I love that on the end.Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man did a good excellent job playing his character. I like the actor he was excellent I really love his performance. Spider-Man was really the first film in the trilogy I saw. Kirsten Dunst was the best of the film as Mary Jane Watson. I love Kirsten she was my teen crush I loved her in Bring It On, The Crow: Salvation, Get Over It and The Virgin Suicides. I really, really miss the actress I grew up watching in Jumanji the actress, she was part of me growing up. James Franco as Harry Osborn was good I like the actor in a comedy Whatever It Takes he was good as Harry Osburn and a friend of Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn is a kick-ass actor he plays so many good roles that I enjoy. I love him in Platoon as Sergeant Elias, White Sands and John Wick he played John Wick's friend Marcus. So I love the guy I love his portrayal.Some Spider-Man fanboy told me that Spider-Man was stalking Mary Jane, it wasn't true. He saw Mary Jane running on the dark streets alone and he saw a muggers following her, so he went after her to help her out and rescuing her, he wasn't stalking her. She was his crush but he wasn't stalking her.In my opinion it is a decent electrifying essential action film of one of the best origin story's of a superhero becoming a Spider-Man. But I am hug fan of Tom Holland's Spider-Man: Homecoming so this Spider-Man is my second personal favorite film in the ""Spider-Man"" franchise that come out of all five films.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","r-02884","19 March 2022","I really, really recommend it. It's really, really good. Everything I ever wanted a superhero to be.

Fame comes with a lot of troubles, but it doesn't matter that we can always usher in the light.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","cinephile-27690","6 April 2020","I like some superhero movies, but it's hard for me to love them. I have a few favorites(Spider Man 2 is my favorite thanks to Roger Ebert), but I have a tendency to not be thrilled by them.I like Tim Burton's Batman movies and Spider Man: Homecoming for instance, but I feel that overall are rather empty. By that, I mean they are good but I don't leave ""satisfied"", if that makes sense.Either the story is undermined and the action is overdone or I don't feel that the action is done right. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, for example, has many flaws and too much action in the last half hour.Because of this, I have only seen a handful of superhero movies. This was actually the first PG-13 movie I ever saw(At about 7 or 8), but I left it for many years and re-visited it when I was 19, nearly 2 years ago.As I got older, I could actually appreciate what Sam Raimi did with Spider Man's origin story. It takes about half the movie for Spider Man to show up, and until then we get to know Peter Parker as a human: a bullied nerd, close to his aunt and uncle, in love with his next door neighbor, etc. Even with spider powers, he is still a kid.That's one thing I enjoy about this movie, and especially the 2nd one. Sam Raimi takes a cartoony character and fleshes him out to make him relate-able.The action is exciting as well, since it comes in when it is necessary and it's not over-blown.There's nothing about the acting I can't complain about as well. Tobey Maguire is a great Spider-Man. He's fine in Sea biscuit and The Great Gatsby, but he's great in this. Willem Defoe is fantastic as The Green Goblin, a Mr. Hyde type character that becomes Spider Man's nemesis. That's his best role since Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ.Of course there are also the actresses Rosemary Harris and Kristen Dunst, and a young James Franco as well.What Spider Man therefore delivers is a fun plot, good action scenes and great acting performances, all balanced very well. The sequel is better, but this is still an excellent origin story that was very much worth telling.Note: This review was originally written on 4/16/19, and has been re-edited and re-posted. I intend to review Spider Man 2 and 3 next.","9/10"

Amazing adaptation of the cult classic Marvel Comic book superhero focusing on `Spidey's origins as geeky photojournalist-to-be Peter Parker (slyly cast Maguire is better than expected; my casting would have been for Wes Bentley but why carp) overrides the action-packed sequences with arch nemesis The Green Goblin aka Norman Osborn (Dafoe perfectly matched replete with Vincent Price's maniacal cackle) the tortured magnate cum scientist father of his best bud Harry (Franco who excels well too) while pining for literally girl-next-door babe redhead Mary Jane Watson (delicious Dunst).  True to the original storyline and purists be damned the film works on every level with fantastic special effects and visuals popping off the screen thanks to the Herculean effort by mad filmmaker and die-hard comic book fan Sam Raimi pulls out all the stops to create a spanking new franchise.  Look sharp for Marvel's Stan `The Man' Lee and Lucy Lawless in blink-and-you'd-miss-them-cameos.

"Spider-Man","kaden_lewis","23 December 2021","Before watching Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), I decided to re watch all the previous Spider-Man movies. However, I wanted to wait to review all the Spider-Man's until after I saw No Way Home so I could get a true rating. Every single Spider-Man movie was amazing, but this one was actually closer to the bottom. Don't get me wrong, this was an amazing movie. It was the original Spider-Man, the one that started it all, and was one of the movies that helped the super hero genre become popular. It was also the first super hero movie I ever watched. The first time I saw it, I was around 7 years old. My dad recommended it as a family movie night choice, and I loved it. I wanted to watch it over and over again. This is the movie I credit with starting my love for super hero movies.All aspects of the movie were also great. I thought they showed the origin story of Peter Parker very well with the spider bite, to his transformation, and the killing of uncle Ben. They just did a great job. I also liked how they decided on a very well known villain to start. Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin was the perfect story. I love him as a villain and I feel it played very well with the story. The transformation into the Green Goblin was also well done.The acting and casting decisions were also perfect. Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was great, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were great as MJ and Harry, uncle Ben and aunt May were portrayed great, J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious, and Willem Dafoe was unbelievable. I honestly believe he is one of the best super hero movie villains of all time. He was great.Lastly, I couldn't believe how good the graphics and effects were for 2002. They were great. I definitely recommend watching this movie. It was very well done, and it you are going to see No Way Home, watch all the Spider-Man movies if you have time. Trust me, I am glad I did.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","dieseldemon85","4 June 2023","I will admit I have never been into comic books, and was never into the MCU films. My other half has always been a fan and periodically has had me watch some of the MCU offerings. A couple were decent but most of what I've been shown made me wonder why anyone would support such no other word but crap. This early 2000's film on the other hand was very entertaining. I think everyone was well cast, the pacing of the film was good as I find during MCU films I watch the clock more, but this kept my interest. Willem Defoe was marvelous as green goblin as is Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. J. K Simmons added a special touch to the character of Jamison. Look forward to seeing part two.","7/10"
"Spider-Man","EddyTheMartian007","21 December 2018","Spiderman is one of the first CBMs I ever watched, and it was the movie which introduced me to Spiderman. After this movie I started to really like Spiderman. Anyways This Movie has surprisingly aged pretty well. There are some very goofy parts(like the bomb which turns people into skeletons), especially near the beginning, but for the most part this is a pretty solid movie.I think the beginning of the movie is probably the weakest, but as it progresses it does get much better. In the beginning of the movie we get the origins of both Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Norman Osborn (Willem Defoe) with both of them being a goofy in their own way. Peter being in a museum where one of 14 genetically modified spiders escapes and bites Peter, and possibly bites other people?! Also the Spider gives peter abs. Also peter doesn't tell anyone about getting bitten by a radioactive spider? I mean you'd probably die. We also get Green Goblin yelling like a madman when he very stupidly tests out the serum on himself. I thought the motivations were told well enough, but it was shown way to quick. The school bits with peter weren't very convincing, they didn't feel like an actual school, and when he figures out his powers it didn't really make sense logically, especially when he's jumping off of Buildings with some very outdated CGI. I do think Norman's descend into insanity was done very well.Once we get to Peter's relationship with Aunt May(Rosemary Harris), and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) (which are both great) the movie really picks up and gets much better. The dialogue between Uncle Ben and Peter is really good, and they feel like a family, and when the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" line is dropped it has a huge impact. The relationship is relatable to people who've lost someone. When Uncle Ben dies because of Peter ""revenge"" against the Wrestling Promoter, it's handled extremely well. Peter in some way caused his Uncle's death and Peter feels responsible. When Uncle Ben dies it's emotional and you feel the impact and dread it brings peter. He's once again filled with revenge trying to kill his supposed killer. Once again when he ""accidentally"" cause the killer to die peter realized what he has done, and then it hits him. ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"". Peter now realizes he should use he's powers for good, and thus Spiderman is born! Also he made his own suit somehow...Peter's Arc in the movie is one of the best parts of this film. Another great relationship is Harry (James Franco) and Norman Osborn. Harry is really good in this movie, Peter and Harry's friendship is established since the beginning and it's done well. There's a great Juxtaposition done with Peter and Uncle Ben's connection, compared to Harry's and Norman's connection. Uncle Ben was always kind and close to Peter while Norman is always cold and distant to Harry. It brews a good rivalry between Harry and Peter when Norman wants a son like Peter. The other character and one of the weaker ones, but still good enough is Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst). She unfortunately is the average Damsel in Distress. They try to give her some more character with having abusive parents, but it's never expanded on. Peter's and Her relations ship is kinda weird, it works better when it was Spiderman and MJ, but Peter feels kinda weird around her.I think Norman Osborn was a pretty good villain, his motivations make some sense, and he's insane so it's a bit more excusable. Willem Dafoe's performance was very enjoyable, and I think he brought some good character. The only real problem I have with him is the motivations against Spiderman aren't exactly too clear. Despite this I thought he was a pretty solid villain, and the 3rd act with him making Peter choose MJ or children was very good. The ending of Norman accidentally killing himself, and Peter revealing to Harry that he ""killed"" his father brings more rivalry for the future.
Overall I think this was a very good movie. I do have a few problems, like the beginning of the film. That really brought this movie down for me. Also it's kinda goofy in some areas, but when it's serious it hits. The rest of the movie is really good though, and to me this is the perfect example of a CBM origin movie.7/10","8/10"

"Spider-Man","Shmaden","12 December 2021","In preparation for Spider-Man No Way Home I decided to rewatch all the old Spider-Man movies starting with this one and ending with TASM 2. So let's get straight into the meat of this review and break this movie's plot down!Plot breakdown:The movie starts with what I can only describe as one of the best movie intros of all time. Not only the visuals are great and awesome at foreshadowing the characters in the movie mainly Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, it also has one of the best superhero movie themes of all time! It sets up perfectly the tone of this movie giving you the feeling of awe, drama, action, suspence and maturity above all. The latter is probably the thing most superhero movies today lack. But more on that later. The first scene perfectly establishes the character of Peter Parker having him run after a bus and barely getting on it courtesy of MJ. In about 5 minutes we learn more about this character than we found out about Tom Holland's Peter in maybe the first movie alltogether. We see Peter as slob, nerdy and socially incapable of having interactions with other people. And above all we see that even before he gets his superpowers his life sucked. That's a great way to build up your character by having him squashed again and again. We barely get to the Spider laboratory scene and we yet again see a moment in which Peter gets humiliated by both the movie and the characters in it. MJ starts looking at him and waves her hand towards him only to see that in fact she was waving her hand towards some of her friends coming from behind Peter. Than Harry Osborn gets introduced in another great introductory scene with his dad who seems not only very totalitarian towards him but also very cold and distant. Then Harry introduces Peter to Norman and after that we get the spider laboratory scene where Peter gets bullied again and at the end he gets bit by a spider. Simultaneously we see Norman getting a visit from the military general who gives him an ultimatum for human trial of his human enhancement serum. This sets him on his path to becoming the Green Goblin by having him test the serum on himself and going nuts. All the while Peter comes home and starts to transform into Spider-Man. He wakes up having big muscles and having no problem with his eye sight. There is also great humor in this scene as Peter slowly realises that a change has happened to him. No humor in this movie seems or feels forced or too much like in the MCU movies to the point in which half of it lands and the other half not. Anyway, Peter goes to school and starts talking with MJ from a distance while she can't hear a word he says only to lose the bus and see that his hands are becoming more sticky. Than at school he fires his first web and gets into a fight with Flash whom he totally beats down. Everyone gets away then from him and he runs in a dark alley where he climbs the walls for the first time. After that he tests his web slinging capabilities only to end up badly as he misses his appointment with his uncle to paint the kitchen. Then he takes out the trash and has a nice little talk with MJ which ends with Flash coming to get her in his new cool car. So, Peter decides to try get some money to buy a car to impress MJ. He designs his suit to go into a wrestling competition where if he could hang on 3 minutes in the ring with a pro wrestler he would win 3000$. The next day Norman is found passed out in his office by Harry and then one of his secretaries or whatever tells him that they found the scientist that helped him in his test last night dead and the equipment stolen. Back to Peter, uncle Ben drives him to the library where he said he was going. Then they have a nice talk about responsability which ends badly as Peter shouts he is not his father. Then he goes to the wrestling competition, beats up the fighter in a cage and gets only 100$. The boss then gets robbed and Peter lets the thief get away with the money. Then he finds his uncle shot down and doesn't even gets to say a proper goodbye to him. After finding out which way the robber is going he goes after him, does the web slinging thing for the first time which is so wonderful to see. He actually starts off slow and cautious to then get used to it and get better at it. The thief then has an accident while inside an old building with Peter questioning him about Ben's death and he falls off and dies. Then we see Quest aerospace's test thwarted by the Green Goblin and the scene switches marvelously to Peter's graduation. He then goes home and cries about uncle Ben who he would have liked to have arround at his graduation. He then takes up his painting of Spider-Man and we get the amazingly and also funny montage of Spider-Man encounters. Then we get introduced to one of the greatest legends in cinema of all time. It's JJ Jameson who tries to shine a bad light on Spider-Man. We then see MJ and Pete meet outside a restaurant or shop where we find out that MJ is in the pursuit of acting on stage and also now dating Harry. Speaking of him, Harry offers to help Pete find a job through his dad, to which Peter refuses and instead opts for becoming Spider-Man's photographer. It's so nice to see daily events like living together in an apartment and searching for a job being integrated so well into the story and tying into Spider-Man as a superhero. We never make a detour in this movie, even the slower paced moments are realistic and done in order to progress the story forwards. The movie flows so well as a result. We then see Peter getting a freelance with Daily Bugle and Norman getting the boot. Afterwards is the World Unity Festival which gets attacked by the Green Goblin. Everything ends in Spider-Man stopping him and saving MJ. Norman then talks to the Green Goblin and we dig deeper into his and Goblin's character. Afterwards JJ Jameson gets a visit from the Goblin and Spider-Man who gets sedated by some vapor Goblin releases in his face. Then they have a chat on rooftop in which Goblin proposes that Spidey joins him and become the most powerful people in the world. Then Pete runs into MJ again and then saves her from some thugs to have then the awesome reversed kiss. Then Spider-Man saves a baby from the fire and goes into it again to save an apparent women who is in fact the Goblin in disguise. Spider-Man gets hurt in the process which gives him up in front of Norman at the tanksgiving dinner which ends in a disaster. So, now the stage is set for the finale, and what a finale it is. The Goblin traumatises aunt May, and then kidnapps MJ and a bunch of kids. He then releases them both forcing Spidey to choose. Again emphasising the idea that with a responsibility we can't have and do everything we want. Such a great message. The movie ends with a battle between Spidey and Goblin. And I really love this fight because it really shows the lack of experience Spider-Man has at the beginning of his career of fighting crime. He barely wins through a combination of resilience and an accident which has the glider kill Norman. The movie ends with Norman's funeral and Peter refusing to be with MJ even though she just confessed her love for him. Again, stregthening the idea that with great power comes great responsibility and hence you can't have it all.End of plot Breakdown!What a wonderful and full of web slinging fun movie! I think the thing that impressed me the most in this viewing was the realism of these characters who are so well developed and flashed out that you end up caring just as much for the man under the mask as for the man with the mask. The humor is restrained and I would say more than 80% of it works and lands, unlike the newer MCU movies which insist with so much humor that at times it's hard to figure it out if the movie is an action/drama/adventure or a straight out comedy. This movie uses humor sparingly and with finese so that almost everytime it works. The action scenes are fantastically choreographed not to overly exagerated but rather more grounded and impactful giving the movie even more of a realism feeling. The music is another hit in this movie. The original score for this movie and the whole trilogy is quite simply legendary. So many awesome cues and themes that just enchance the movies experience. The acting is another winner in this movie. Everyone delivers at least a competent performance if not brilliant (Willem Defoe). Him as Norman Osborne and Green Goblin is simply mesmerizing. I couldn't take my eys of him in every scene he was in. He really gives Alfred Molina a run for his money. The next guy I wanna talk about is JJ Jameson (played brilliantly by J. K. Simmons). I mean it doesn't get any better than this. Wait, it actually does in Spider-Man 2. But as superhero movies are concerned before this movie came out I haven't seen a more charismatic performance from an actor ever in a superhero movie. What an absolute and complete legend this guy is! He was so legendary that MCU decided to recast him in the new Holland movies. It wouldn't be fair to point out only the great things this movie does and not pin point some flaws: like the chessy ending to the first fight between Goblin and Spidey or the Goblin's suit which at this point, 20 years later seems a bit goofy given that we saw more realistic superhero costumes in the MCU. Not to forget the cringy dialogue at some points which took me out of the scene a little. Having said that Spider-Man's costume is one of the most legendary superhero costumes in a superhero movie. All in all, a great movie, very realistic in its depiction of an actual superhero dealing with his double life in the real world and with a lot of heart and fun put into it. Not to forget the maturity showed by the characters in it, which so many new MCU movies lack for the sake of humor. Not to forget we owe it to movies like this one and Spider-Man 2 and 3 that MCU now exists. This movie paved the way for them. 10/10.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","bradykitchen-33648","29 August 2021","Acting in this was extremely well done in huge part because of the castings. Every actor looked like they were born into that role especially Tobey and Willam. Tobey is great as Peter and fits that role very well. Dafoe is nothing short of a menace.Action was great and surprisingly brutal at times which added a sense of realism. Sam Rami is great at creating tho sense of darkness while also keeping that sense of hope in the each scene.It took a little too long for the goblin and Spider-Man stories to intertwine not a huge issue but something to note.The goblins suit was very cheesy, took a little bit away from Willams performance.Overall great 8/10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","DavidSim240183","4 April 2006","Although a huge Spider-Man fan, I must confess I've never read a single Spider-Man comic. Everything I know about the character comes from the cartoons. First the classic one with that song. Then the updated one from the 90's which took a more adult stance, and allowed us to get behind the masks and see the people inside. And now finally, Spider-Man gets the big budget treatment, given a distinctly absurdist spin by one of my favourite directors, Sam Raimi.Sam Raimi is a self-professed Spidey fan, and his enthusiasm for the character shines through warm and bright. Raimi has taken care to ensure the emotional core that always drew people to Spidey in the first place is still intact.The story begins on the day Peter Parker is changed into Spider-Man. Parker is a gawky teenager who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. He pines for the girl next door, Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He's friends with super rich Harry Osborn, the son of industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe).When Parker goes on a field trip to Columbia State University, he gets bitten by a radioactive spider, and is thus transformed. He can now shoot webbing from his wrists, he has superhuman strength and agility, and he can stick to walls.At the same time, Norman Osborn goes through a transformation of his own. Pressured by his superiors to perfect a new type of super suit, the experiment goes wrong (the film is admittedly a bit vague on this point) and Osborn is driven insane. With the new suit and a hi-tech glider, he becomes the Green Goblin, and sets out to grab power.Meanwhile, Peter's new-found abilities go to his head. He beats up the school bully, and gets off on the adrenaline rush. He feels he can now win the heart of Mary-Jane, but first he needs cash. He goes into wrestling, and there's a great scene where we see Peter try out new designs for an outfit. I got a genuine feeling of exhilaration when I saw the final Spider-Man suit.But Peter's odd behaviour hasn't gone unnoticed by Aunt May and Uncle Ben. In a very poignant scene, Ben tries to teach Peter about the dangers of power. Thankfully we still get the classic line ""With great power, comes great responsibility."" But Peter doesn't want to listen.When Peter goes into the wrestling ring, he comes out a winner. The wrestling promoter doesn't give him the money he wants, and is then robbed. But Peter makes no effort to stop him. Just for the sake of revenge. Peter's power trip has sent him sky high.And comes crashing down to Earth. Uncle Ben is killed, and in a fit of rage, Peter wants vengeance. Only to find the murderer is the same man who robbed the promoter. The man Peter let go. A man who ends up dead after going through a window. A man Peter doesn't try to save.Filled with remorse, Peter takes Ben's words of wisdom to heart, and puts his powers to good use. As the amazing Spider-Man.One thing that struck me about Spider-Man was how aptly cast it was. Tobey Maguire is pitch perfect as Peter Parker, finding the right amount of shy awkwardness and balancing it with teenage angst. But unfortunately, he seems a little lost in the Spidey suit. He never really comes alive.Kirsten Dunst is a fine actress most of the time, but spends half of it screaming as Mary-Jane. When she's not though, she makes an impression, displaying a touching vulnerability when her acting career goes nowhere.Willem Dafoe is suitably manic, but we never really get behind the Green Goblin's mask. Sam Raimi explored this territory to far greater effect in his earlier effort Darkman. Dafoe goes rather over the top, and his performance falls into clich√©. Still, there are some scenes involving the Green Goblin's psychosis I liked, such as the supremely eerie scene when Norman argues with himself in a mirror.James Franco is an insipid Harry Osborn. He walks around the film with a tortured puppy dog look that is very irritating. He is definitely the most shallow character in the film, and if truth be told, contributes nothing.Cliff Roberts and Rosemary Harris are great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. There is a lot of warmth to their characters, and they're utterly believable. But who could forget J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. He is 100% spot on in the part. Capturing everything. The mannerisms. Gruff voice. Temper tantrums. You perk up every time he's on the scene. It's just a pity he doesn't get more to do.Honestly though, Spider-Man is a little disappointing. It doesn't quite fire on all cylinders. The components for a great film are all there, but somehow it doesn't add up to a satisfying whole.The first half is effective as Peter comes to terms with what he's become, but as the special effects take over, the human element gets lost in the crowd. Some of the action scenes are unimpressive, and the latter half is not as compelling as it should be.When I first saw Spider-Man, I loved it because it was gratifying to see things following the path of the cartoons. But after watching it several times, I now realise it is a rather flawed film, marred by a disappointing climax.Personally, I prefer Spider-Man 2. It is a far superior film, because it is much more well rounded, and makes better use of it's characters. It also irons out the flaws the original had. Spider-Man is perfectly watchable, but it's not up there with Superman or Batman.A good film, but not a great one. Although the classic song on the end credits was a nice touch!","9/10"
"Spider-Man","frankiesilver-91836","24 June 2022","This is a very campy typical superhero movie but it does everything it sets out to do. A simple first theatrical depiction of the story of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man that explains just as much as it needs to.People complain he's too awkward but I think Tobey Maguire was cast perfectly. In fact, the entire cast was great: MJ, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, Jameson, and especially Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Willem Dafoe does a truly amazing job. He is the star of the movie especially with that iconic laugh.The comedy is pretty decent too. It got a few chuckles out of me.The fight scenes leave a bit to be desired with how far we've come in the 19 years since this movie released, but they're perfectly fine albeit aged.The ending with Peter denying MJ was super sad and genuinely makes you wonder if he'll ever get with her.In conclusion this is a pretty damn good superhero movie.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","abalpn-99472","11 October 2019","""With great power, comes great responsibility."" From the great Cliff Robertson.Before the MCU, I've watched this in 2002 when I was fourteen. Tobey Maguire was great playing the role of Spider-Man. Willem Dafoe was brilliant and scary playing the Green Goblin. I liked his evil laugh. The Green Goblin is my favorite villain in Marvel. Kristen Dunst is beautiful as Mary Jane Watson. The film had dark moments and I liked them. Danny Elfman's composing is beyond incredible. There were some scenes that made me emotionally sad. I still liked the action. When I watched the film it was like watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series from 1994.I saw Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. The last two films were dark with Doctor Octopus and Venom. All 3 of them are my favorite trilogy by Sam Raimi. He and his brother Ted are still geniuses.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","ryanward-45039","4 January 2023","These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas; Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look. Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. Run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's (Toby Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn (James Franco); add Harry's father Norman (Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation. But of course we can't forget Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and J. Johan Jameson (J. K. Simmons).The plot is where a New York City teenager, Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider during a field trip and feels incredibly nauseous. He wakes up the next day and notices he feels stronger and better than ever, and had the ability to climb walls, shoot webs and fight full power. After his Uncle Ben gets gunned down, he finds his killer and sees this as a perfect opportunity to become to become a hero of New York. He then forms a costume, and is now known as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a scientist, Norman Osborn, does an experiment where he tests out an enhancing chemical on himself, and it gives him the power to go insane and create havoc. Soon, his company, Oscorp, gets sold out by his board members. Norman than suits up as the Green Goblin, and creates terror in New York. Peter Park/Spider-Man must save the city from the Green Goblin, and protect the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson from being killed.Spider-Man is a pretty good, well made, and straightforward movie. The origin story of Spider-Man becoming who he is was made and had a great pace for 2 hours. The cast did a great job. Tobey Maguire, in my opinion, has always been my favorite Spider-Man. He knows how to act normal and tough, and had chemistry with Kristen Dunst. Tom Holland is great as Spidey and Andrew Garfield, not so much.While this film is very cheesy, it's the classic origin of our favorite wall-crawler. I absolutely adore the storytelling of this film, with Sam Raimi's charm all over this film. From the incredibly relatable character of Peter Parker, and how he transforms into a superhero. As we see both the origins of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin happen at the same time in the beginning of the movie.Every moment of this film is so fun to watch. The action, while dated, is very entertaining. The character interactions, are very entertaining. This was a childhood classic for me, and part of the reason I love it so much, is because it's very entertaining.I also enjoy the visual style of the film. It's so energetic in it's look. Just by looking at the film, you can tell Sam Raimi made it. It is drenched in his unique style of visuals. It uses CGI very well, and while the effects don't hold up, I think it helps the visual flare of this film. The city looks like it's out of a comic book, with the bright colors and vibrant locations.But, the best part of the film, are the characters. Toby McGuire is still my favorite Spider-Man. And James Franco plays my favorite Harry Osborn. And William Dafoe plays the seriously over the top Green Goblin, and I love the performance. The other actors, like James Franco (as Harry Osborn), Rosemary Harris (as Aunt May), Cliff Roberson, and of course, J. K Simmons (as J. Jonah Jameson) did a phenomenal job.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.9/10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","dbdumonteil","22 December 2004","Adaptations of comics for the screen have become one of Hollywood's main specialties. So far, most of super-heroes for their transition to the screen were entitled to a reliable film-maker and not to a director of musical video clips. Thus, Tim Burton shot ""Batman"" in 1989 while Bryan Singer amazed with his movie ""X-Men"" (2000). Here, it is Sam Raimi who decided to adapt the adventures of Spider-Man; a plan he surely undertook with joy. Indeed, this iconoclastic film-maker is an avid fan of the comic strip. So, he seemed to be cut out more than anyone else for the film. A surprise: his work doesn't disappoint and maintains itself high above the expectations and is incredibly exhilarating. The movie has been a (largely deserved) triumphant success and for Sam Raimi it was his long-awaited commercial breakthrough. Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing for him to have moved in the Hollywood mainstream.Why is ""Spider-Man"" so successful? Simply because Raimi hired a winning team at all levels. First, Raimi's making reflects the enthusiasm he felt to shot his movie. Full of energy, liveliness, it doesn't leave a minute's rest to the spectator. We are carried away by the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man with a lot of frenzy and happiness. It is useful to note down that at the end of the projection, you feel so happy that you ask for more! To come back to Raimi's making, there's a perfect marriage between impressive action sequences and the interesting psychological portrait Raimi makes of his main character. On another hand, the indispensable amounts of humor and emotion haven't been forgotten.Congratulations to the scriptwriter David Koepp. Why didn't he get an Oscar for his work? He has written a watertight screenplay which is flawless. It does everything to remain faithful to the original comic strip. More important, Koepp conceived his script, mainly as a kind of apprenticeship. Peter Parker will test the extent of his powers (first against one of his rivals in his high school, then during a wrestling fight) before putting his red and blue suit on and facing violence in New York and eventually the Green Buffoon (Im not sure if it's the right name).A brilliant screenplay wouldn't be anything without a suitable cast. It is of an impeccable quality. Thanks to ""Spider-Man"" Tobey McGuire probably finds the role of his life. At last a role at the extent of his talent. Beside him, Kirsten Dunst has such an appealing charm that it is difficult to resist her. Willem Dafoe is just amazing in his role of wicked. As for JK Simmons, he may have a short role but each of his apparitions is a delight so much that he nearly steals the show to the other actors.But special effects aren't always subtle or sometimes a little too intrusive and David Koepp has forgotten to remove a few clich√©s about his main character, notably at the beginning of the film. But fortunately, they are tiny details and if we ignore them, ""Spider-Man"" appears as a blockbuster whose homogeneity is impressive. It satisfies both the fans of the comic strip but also movie lovers. Raimi's masterpiece lasts about two hours. Not a minute is too much in it. You can't refuse such an exciting show like this one. The second part of the adventures of Spider-Man was launched in the summer 2004 with the same crew and was equally successful as the first one. As we say: we don't change a winning team.Well done Mr Raimi!","8/10"
"Spider-Man","samyaksambuddha","23 April 2018","Spider-man is one of the most famous superheroes and this movie does very well to maintain the image of the comic character. And the innocence of Toby Maguire and his beautiful chemistry with Kirsten is wins hearts. This movie has deeper dimensions as it expresses the philosophical dimensions of power- with great power comes great responsibility. This is a great work that shows that each one of us has a superhero within us, we just need to unlock it. The fight sequences with green goblin are interesting. Overall a great watch.","3/10"

"Spider-Man","ShootingShark","13 November 2005","Peter Parker is a high-school kid about to graduate when he is bitten by a genetically-enhanced super-spider. He develops extraordinary powers; great strength, heightened awareness, lightning reflexes and spiderlike abilities to climb and spin webs. At a crossroads in his life, he resolves to become Spiderman, a crime-fighting superhero ...This is a great action blockbuster version of one of the most famous and beloved comic-books of all time - Stan Lee's Spiderman. It had been done before in the seventies as an animated TV show and a pretty good TV-movie, but this is the treatment it really deserves - a big-budget extravaganza with a first-rate cast, terrific sets and special effects and a brilliant visual stylist at the helm. David Koepp's script wisely invests lots of time in the characters - despite the title, this is really a movie about who Peter Parker is, what happens to him, and why he does what he does. Maguire gives an assured but atypical superhero performance, quiet and affable and completely lacking in pretension. Dunst is a great all-American girl, Dafoe is terrific as the schizophrenic villain, alternating between ambitious-but-cowardly scientist Norman Osborn and his depraved alterego, the Green Goblin, and don't miss a funny cameo by Raimi's old pal Campbell as a wrestling emcee. The one duff note is Franco, whose performance is okay but has too much screen-time and whose role seems a bit unnecessary. There are some terrific gags and set-pieces, like the spider-sense sequence in the school and the big parade the Green Goblin attacks, all accompanied by a great Danny Elfman score. This movie was a richly-deserved success both critically and commercially, for one of American's most original and talented directors, but whilst it is very good I'm afraid I have to say that not only is it not Raimi's best movie, it's not even his best comic-book movie (for that, check out Darkman, which is much wilder visually). It's hard to find any fault in such a fabulous fun flick though, which entertains throughout with laughs, scares, romance and thrills.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","KeremUlucay","17 July 2019","""With great power, comes great responsibility."" This is a film about how Peter Parker learned that lesson. Because of that and some scenes, this movie is so comic accurate. In the very first Spider-Man comic book, everything was about that lesson too. Also, in opening sequence of movie Peter says it is all about a girl. That's so true too! But about love, there are some stuff which is so cheesy in that film. Actually it has some more creepy stuff but in the great tempo and editing of the film they are not necessary to think about. Sam Raimi and writers did an amazing job on storytelling and introducing characters. Everything characters do have some reasons; we see what they do, why they do and connection between previous and next acts of characters. Cast is fantastic. I love Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, he is still my best hero because of my childhood. Also, there is someone who steals the show every time: J.K. Simmons. He is fabulous! On the other hand, there is something this movie have which newest Spidey movies don't: Iconic scenes. Remarkable things are happening in that story. Some of them lovely, some of them brutal and some of them exciting. Finally, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movie is a good origin story which this character deserves.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","Toph-22","22 December 2020","'With great power comes great responsibility'. This quote stands like no other for this movie adaption of Spider-Man.Even before the hype around Marvel and the MCU went off, Sam Raimi managed to make Spider-Man suitable for the masses. It's a comic book adaption and that's exactly what it's supposed to be.The way Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man is legendarily staged. Always brilliant how Peter is called into the wrestling ring as the human spider in his costume he sewed together himself. Or how he tries to figure out how to use his net.First parts face the problem of introducing characters and their motives. Spider-Man manages that really well.Tobey Maguire as Spider-man is cult for me. He fits like a glove and embodies the human spider like no other. He is my favorite Spider-Man.J.K. Simmons is convincing as chief editor as usual. The few scenes with him are just fun.The fight between Peter and Green Goblin is also magnificently staged.Very successful prelude to the Spider-Man trilogy.

"Spider-Man","dee.reid","4 May 2002","Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is lonely, insecure, and is in love with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst), a girl he has had a crush on since he was six. One day, while on a field trip to a laboratory where they are studying arachnids, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically altered spider that had accidentally gotten out of its cage. Peter goes home in a daze over what has just happened. The next day, he finds himself mysteriously buffed up and no longer needs to wear glasses. So off he goes to school to endure another day of torment by his peers. Just as he is about to start eating lunch, a weird feeling comes to Peter, just as Mary Jane is about to slip in a puddle. Peter catches Mary Jane and her lunch just in the nick of time. After he continues eating, Peter accidentally shoots a string of web from his wrist. While trying to hide the webbing, he accidentally pulls a lunch tray and it hits one of his tormentors in the back. Peter then hauls a** out of the cafeteria. The guy he hit in the back follows Peter, looking for a fight. Peter is able to miraculously overcome his opponent with the use of his new found ""spider-sense"". On the way home, he begins running and running and finally leaping from building to building and then spinning and spinning. Peter decides to keep his new abilities secret, but when a thief that he could have stopped kills his beloved Uncle Ben, he then decides that he is going to use his abilities to fight crime. It seems that his abilities could not have come at a better time, as he now has to square off against the mysterious and deadly Green Goblin/Norman Osborn(Willem Dafoe).""Spider-Man"" definitely is the movie to see this year. The hype surrounding this movie is unbelievable. When I went to see this movie yesterday, the theater was packed. Everybody cheered when Peter beat up that one guy and when he tracked down the man who killed his uncle. It seems to me that this movie affected everyone in the theater the same way. There is a very wide range of emotions to be experienced when watching this movie. Some of the emotions I'm talking about like happiness, loss, grief, and good triumphing over evil to name a few. Sam Raimi of ""The Evil Dead"" fame is the perfect director for this film. Some of the comic elements that he uses in some of his earlier films are highly present in this film. You should also be on the lookout for Raimi favorite Bruce Campbell in a small cameo as a ring announcer. This movie succeeds because of two key things: smart casting choices and epic storytelling. First off, Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man! I must admit, that I followed some of my friends when they said that Tobey Maguire could not play Peter Parker. I found out yesterday that is not true. He is Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man. He owns that role. Much as Christopher Reeve played the part of Superman and Michael Keaton was Batman before him, Tobey Maguire will take his place in superhero history as Spider-Man. He is a very good actor in this movie. The scene where he visits Aunt May in the hospital or the ending scene in the cemetery where he talks to Mary Jane about their relationship all go to show how good he can act. Although I have not payed that much attention to Kirsten Dunst, I must admit that she was perfectly cast as Mary Jane Watson. She really has that girl-next-door kind of charisma that is required for a role like hers. Willem Dafoe easily plays one of the best comic book villains of all time as Green Goblin. He's basically torn by grief from loosing his company and from pursuing a life of crime as Green Goblin. The scene where he talks to the Green Goblin mask is one of his best scenes.The costumes for Spider-Man and Green Goblin are some of the most fantastic costume designs and make up effects I've seen since ""Dick Tracy"". This movie deserves to get an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up.The action sequences are some of the best I've ever seen for a superhero movie. The web-slinging scenes, whilst being computer animated, are extremely convincing, largely because they look so real. The scene at the party where Spider-Man and Green Goblin meet for the first time is probably the best action scene in the movie.""Spider-Man"" deserves all the praise that it is going to receive, no doubt. I love this movie. I really want to go see it again, but I know that I probably won't be able to. This movie will blow you away, it'll make you want to cheer and it'll make you want to cry. I give ""Spider-Man"" a big 10.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","adamsmith-51004","14 April 2021","""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable film. This film tells the origin story of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J. K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. I can watch this film over and over again, and it's still great to watch and it never disappoints to entertain.","10/10"

"Spider-Man","GuyCC","30 June 2002","I meant to review this months ago when I had (by great luck) managed to attend the premiere in Los Angeles.  Regardless, with a ""better late than never"" attitude, this has turned out to be one of Summer 2002's bright spots in an incredibly busy movie season.As it stands, ""Spider-Man"" has all the right elements: A real comic book ""feel"" to it, an excellent Danny Elfman score, Tobey Maguire as a totally believable Peter Parker (with just the right amounts of shyness and the ""old Parker luck""), an appropriately sinister Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, and a scene-stealing performance by J. K. Simmons as the cigar-chomping J. Jonah Jameson.  That's a character that should have been used more in the movie, as he was a lot of fun to see in action.  Here's hoping for more screen time in the next one.There wasn't a lot that I didn't like about this movie.  I still didn't like the Green Goblin costume as much as I tried to, the organic web-shooters didn't bother me half as much as I had figured (perhaps as they weren't overplayed as being so), and while Kirsten Dunst didn't do a bad job as Mary Jane, she just never really captured the ""look"" of what I though the character should be.As for the ""goods"" of the film, the battles were perfectly set up as comic-cook style brawls, with plenty of exaggerated movements and situations.  When Spider-Man web-swung through the streets of New York (love the costume), I couldn't help but get a chilled sense of awe that I originally felt after seeing the first trailer last year.  And the character relationships were great.  ""Spider-Man"" the comic has always been as much about the man behind the mask as it is about the hero.  I'm so relieved that Sam Raimi took noticeable attempts to balance the two.Despite its comic-book origins, the last battle is pretty intense, comparably so to the Tim Burton ""Batman"" films.  And the Green Goblin's scare tactics even made myself jump a few times.  So parents with very little ones may want to check out the film first to see if the kids can handle it.  But in that regard, I'm glad Raimi took the film seriously enough to not let it delve into the lame campiness that was ""Batman & Robin"".  And I'm really glad that they didn't take too many liberties with the Spider-Man origin to remove the emotional impact that it carried throughout the film.As a movie, it retained all of the wonder, excitement and fun that has endeared me to Spider-Man since I was a kid.  As a super-hero film, I can compare it to the orignal ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" films in its high-quality treatment.  I will wait impatiently for the feature-packed (I hope) DVD, and will have faith that the next installment of the series will be as rewarding as this one was.  A must see.  A fun movie.","9/10"

The costumes are fabulous. the screenplay is very interesting : there are sad moments and there are the collet fightings. For me Spiderman is a big classic of Marvel's films because Spiderman is the super hero of our childhood. For me he is the best super hero because I love his suit and his super powers. The only negative point is that it is not really a funny movie. If you like action and superhero movies, you need to watch Spiderman.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","The Spectacular Spider-Man","13 January 2003","The whole point of Spider-Man is what would happen if a real person was a superhero? What if a superhero really existed? In real life? What if there was a superhero, not a Kryptonian in fictional Metropolis, but a real kid in New York?
The suit used in the movie just emphasised the fact that the film was a typical superhero movie. It's a given that superheroes in films have cool costumes; Batman, Spawn, the X-Men, etc. So Spidey followed this, as the audience expected. But the whole point is that Peter can't make a cool, high-tech costume because he doesn't have the resources or the means. He's just a kid, doing what he can. 
If Spider-Man actually existed, he would look like the Nicolas Hammond 1970's TV version. A cheap, garish and silly costume (in the comics, Spidey's costume was often criticised) is exactly what Spidey originally wore in the comics and so wore in the TV show, and would wear in real life.
The cheap costume is endearing. It shows this average guy is doing his best to be a superhero, trying his hardest with the little he has. We can all relate to it, as it's about as good as the average person could do, no better. I feel if the director Sam Raimi and co had been brave enough to make a film of the Spidey concept (a superhero in real life, cheap costume and all) and not try and animate comicbook panels, then we'd really be onto something.","9/10"

"Spider-Man","bregund","4 May 2003","There are spoilers in this review.First of all, the casting of Tobey Maguire for the lead role is the film's biggest mistake.  With his pointy lip, jumbo ears, big nose, and squeaky voice, he resembles Screech from Saved By The Bell (I take it Dustin Diamond wasn't available).  Much like Michael Keaton in Batman, Maguire doesn't even remotely resemble the title character.  Since we're talking about miscast superheroes, thank god they didn't make that Superman movie starring Nicholas Cage.  Maguire isn't the only miscast actor in this dud.  Aunt May is annoying, Kirsten Dunst is a terrible actress and Willem Dafoe as the squeaky-voiced Green Goblin¬Öwell, let's just say that boy aint right.  They emasculated the J. Jonah Jameson character; in the comic book he's a huge, scary, angry editor who resembles a wrestling character, but in the film he's a meek, squeaky-voiced, accountant-looking guy with all the screen presence of Droopy the dog.  What is it with the squeaky voices?  About the only actor who resembles one of the characters is Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, who doesn't die of a heart attack as he did in the comic book.  Couldn't they keep anything authentic?You know all those really cool special effects showing Spiderman looping through the city between the buildings?  Well, about ninety-seven percent of the film contains scenes that are not that.  Which is to say that three percent of the film doesn't contain scenes that are boring and stretched out endlessly until you want to gouge out your eyeballs with a rusty spike.  The chemistry between Maguire and Dunst is ice-cold.  There are long stretches of boring, pointless scenes that do nothing for the film, such as the wrestling scene.  Parker wants money to buy a car so he can impress MJ.  What was the point of all this?  Spiderman should be out saving people's lives and stopping crime, not worrying about getting money for a car.  This film is laced with continuity and character problems.  The Green Goblin has absolutely no reservations about destroying a balcony full of people, including his own son, and yet when the people on the bridge throw trash at him how does he react?  By letting them throw trash at him.  Why didn't he just blow them away?  And just because Osborne kills the board of directors does not make their decision non-binding.  If Osborne was thrown out for being inept, it's almost assured that the new board of directors would do the same thing.  And the ending is a real problem:  Harry blames Spiderman for his father's death, but how would Harry know that?  Spiderman would have to tell Harry that he killed his father, in which case he would have to tell him thata)  it was an accidentb)  his father was really the Green GoblinThis dry, pointless, barren film has singlehandedly sucked all the fun and joy out of Spiderman forever.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","eti55","13 January 2013","Spiderman took me back to when I was 11, when I read the Spidey comics. More than any other comic-based movie, this is the comic book come to life, and it's better than any super hero movie I've seen before or since.I know, I know, a lot of Dark Knight enthusiasts will poo-poo this assessment. Fine (I'd rank The Dark Knight at #2). The thing is, I like movies that balance the serious stuff with a sense of humor (the Spidey comics did this), which is where the Dark Knight franchise falls short. For example, the man-on-the-street stuff leading up to Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson's initial rant had me absolutely rolling. The ill-tempered and insufferable Jameson was done to a T by J K Simmons (""We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong, we can certainly get a picture of THIS weirdo!""). He actually did the comic book character one better; his performance definitely was the straw that stirred the drink mid-film. This is a good thing, as Spidey isn't quite the wise-ass in the movie that he is in the comic (my only complaint, and it's minor).That said, Tobey McGuire does a fine job of balancing Peter Parker, the nerdy science whiz kid, with his genetically-mutated Spiderman alter-ego, creating a bona-fide hero that the audience can root for. It seems every super hero has something that drives them to be a crusader for justice, and in Parker's case it was the guilt over failing to use his new spider powers to stop a thief who would go on to murder his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson in one of his many reliably good performances), who was also his only real father figure. As Parker's love interest Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst is sweet and likable, with just the right amount of sex appeal tossed in. James Franco is good as Parker's spoiled best buddy Harry Osbourne. This leads us to..wait for it..Willem Dafoe, whose portrayal of Harry's father Norman, the arrogant scientist and CEO of Oscorp who puts his own personal ambition ahead of safety for himself and his test subjects, leading to his transformation (via ingesting/inhaling an experimental ""performance enhancing"" drug) into the thoroughly evil, wildly insane and megalomaniacal Green Goblin, is frighteningly convincing, so much so that you can easily look past the cheesy exo- skeleton outfit he wears. Again, I felt like I was seeing the comic book come to life.As for the effects/action sequences, I know, they've been panned by some (notably Roger Ebert), but they looked good to me. I actually liked the fact that they weren't overdone. Ebert in particular criticized the CGI in this movie, but to me, ALL CGI looks phony and cartoonish. I thought the effects looked just fine as CGI goes, and the action sequences were first rate. One scene in particular where Spiderman is hanging by his web while holding onto a train car full of kids, and at the same time trying to save Mary Jane, is exceptionally gripping. It all leads up to a nice payoff at the end, with the final confrontation between Spidey and the Goblin.The fact that this movie came out within a week of the disappointing Attack of the Clones served as a reminder to this former fan of the Star Wars franchise exactly why I like these kinds of movies. It's not about the special effects; it's the people and the story (pity George Lucas forgot about that. Unfortunately so had Sam Raimi by the time he made Spidey 3). What makes Spiderman such a great movie comes down to a good story (lifted from the comic but adjusted to fit the times), along with fun, likable characters you can root for, compelling villains to root against, and good peripheral characters to stir things up (aside from Simmons, Bruce Campbell makes the most of his screen time as a wrestling ring announcer (Ann: what's your name kid? Parker: The Human Spider. Ann: The Human Spider, that's it? That's the best you've got? Parker: Yeah. Ann: Aaaahh, that sucks!) See this again, and don't bother with the reboot.","1/10"
"Spider-Man","cherold","15 December 2012","I just watched 2012's Amazing Spider-Man, and it reminded me of how hugely disappointed I was by this 2002 movie. And I just feel like ranting about it, because ten years later, it still really bugs me.It's funny what I remember from this movie. For example, I remember Peter practicing with his web by shooting it at a soda can. I remember that because I remember how the can was placed to perfectly display the brand name in a way that shouted out THIS IS PRODUCT PLACEMENT! If they had set the can down so the brand name was slightly off center I probably wouldn't remember that now.But that wasn't the problem with the movie. That was fine. I recall it being a cute scene. The problem with the movie was the script seemed to have been written by a bunch of people who weren't reading each other's contributions. The best example of this involved Peter and Mary Jane. Early in the film, Peter is either practicing saying something to MJ or writing something to her - I don't recall which - along the lines of, ""you don't really know me even though we live next door blah blah blah."" At the end of the movie, MJ makes this speech to Peter about how she realizes he was always there for her. It really aggravated me, because those two tiny segments are opposites that don't belong in the same movie. How can you make a huge, big-budget film and not catch that contradiction?The real problem with this movie, though, is the bad guy. I don't really remember the story, I just remember there really wasn't much of one. The bad guy was lame and it all went nowhere.Overall, this was a terrible series, with only Spider-Man 2 worth watching (and that one was not as good as The Amazing Spider-Man). But what bugs me most of all is how so few people seemed to have noticed what a terrible script this movie had. What's up with that?","8/10"
"Spider-Man","s10ace37","1 May 2002","While I do like the film versions of X-Men, and the first of both the Batman and Superman films, I have to say that Spider-Man stands out above all the other comic based movies.  I caught a sneak preview of what I believe will be the biggest film of the year, and it delivered. Tons of fast paced explosive action, and the story is timeless, and teaches many an important lesson as well.  Tobey McGuire was a perfect choice for Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and now I can't picture anyone else in the role.  And while not as memorable as Jack Nicholson's Joker, Willem Defoe is a great Green Goblin (just wait till you hear him laugh...it'll freak you out). Sam Raimi has just made his best picture, which is hard to believe seeing as Evil Dead 2 is genius.  This is a great film that many will see over and over again, and it is DEFINETLY going to give Episode 2 a run for its money. 9 out of 10.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","Netscape_Navigator","3 January 2009","What an odd way to describe a Spider-Man movie of all things huh? Well, let me explain.After I saw Spider-Man 3 in 2007, the disgusting display of incompetent film making and lazy attempts to make money and simply get by on the name alone, left me with nothing but a raging hatred in my core for everyone involved in that abomination of a movie. Watching part 1 again reminded me of how magnificent this franchise used to be. I can't believe these characters that I fell in love with- Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Harry, J. Jonah Jameson, are people that I actually wanted to commit felony acts of violence against in part 3 (particularly Mary Jane and Harry). It was so bad and personal, that I even said that if they continue making more Spider-Man movies in the future, that I would like nothing more than Kirsten Dunst NOT to return (a complete contrast to my views of her in parts 1 and 2, where I loved her). Seeing part 3 even made me second guess myself as to whether the first two actually deserved perfect 10s as I originally scored them. Well, seeing them again reminded me that they ABSOLUTELY deserve 10s, and that's why I'm writing this review. I'll stick to talking about part 1 here.**Great job adapting the comic to the big screen. They captured the campy humor of the comics perfectly, with lovable corny one-liners done just well enough to be corny, but not excessively that it becomes a joke.**At it's core, this movie is basically a love story about a nerd awkwardly trying to win over the girl he loves, with things getting a tad bit complicated having to deal with the fact that he's got superhuman powers. This is a romance story story running parallel to a superhero movie, and it's interwoven with expert craftsmanship, it completely engrosses you.**I've gotta give it to Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, they did some great acting here. All of their scenes feel so genuine. Who can't relate to those little moments that they had together? Like every time they happen to meet up by chance, they would say ""Oh hey!!!"" with a genuine look of surprise as their faces light up with happiness, followed by awkward, nervous conversation masked by their smiles, with Peter consciously making sure to minimize dead air in the conversation. Again, the most authentic thing in all of this is the ""oh hey!!!"" part. Not sure about everyone else, but in my experience, this is THE default greeting between a male and a female that are moderately close, upon unexpectedly meeting each other (less close could result in a simple, less upbeat, ""hey what's up,"" and more close could be running up and giving them a hug).**There's a certain *simplistic nature to this movie that you become fond of. There's a very dense, linear approach that pretty much forces you to love the characters, and want to see the nerd win the girl, and save the day.**If I had to do one thing differently, I would change the Green Goblin's costume. It was too over the top and cartoonish, they should've modernized the look, make it look like something that would be issued by the military for combat. They wouldn't wear a mask that looked like that..Parts 1 and 2 compared to part 3 are like day and knight. Regardless of The Dark cloud which is part 3 hanging over this franchise, these first two installments are the best superhero movies made in terms of pure enjoyment.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","hereuser","29 July 2022","Let's start there!For It's time this movie has great effects and green screen working! You can't expect something perfect like nowadays.The scenario is so involving and twisting, but not confusing. It makes you watch it with pure happiness and calmness. We have the typical ""superhero priorities"", but he is also the first superhero who had personal problems(I mean in the comics and now we see it on screen). We have the main characters that have always been involved with the crimes and fights (Harry Osborn, Uncle Ben,etc.). Nobody is missing!We have the one and only Peter Parker with organic web shooters, which actually makes more sense into the name of ""super powers"", and not just high tech web shooter and your only privilege of powers to be climbing. It is so much more heroic and going on with the whole radioactivity spider story than just doing everything with high tech. It gives him character, actual story and actual powers.The acting is one of the best things here. You can forget Tobey Maguaire and call him Spider-man from now on, 'cause he gave out the best perspective of what your friendly neighbor should be!","10/10"

This movie didn't let me down.Tobey Maguire fit the part very well. He just had the look. I am in love with Kirsten Dunst, so there was no doubt in my mind that she was going to do great. Willem Defoe even made Speed 2 exciting, so again, there were no doubts.Danny Elfman may have ripped himself off for the soundtrack, but it still wasn't bad.Spider-man is one of our most recent classics. 10/10.

"Spider-Man","ccthemovieman-1","2 August 2006","I enjoyed watching this on DVD a lot more than seeing it at the theater. I also enjoyed the sequel a lot more than this movie, although this has its moments if you can get past the stupid teen romance. The latter is especially unneeded and overdone at the end of the movie.Willem Dafoe is an interesting villain and a decent choice for the role since his resume is dotted with strange characters over the years. One wonders if he - like Johnny Depp - ever plays a ""normal"" person.This film is very good in the sound effects department if you have a surround system. That was one reason I enjoyed it more at home. Big screens make you lose sharpness in a film, too. Tobey Maguire plays a likable ""Peter Potter"" (Spiderman) while Kristen Dunst is annoying as girlfriend ""Mary Jane Watson."" It was kind of interesting to see '60s movie-TV star Cliff Robertson again, as Peter's ""Uncle Ben."" This is not up to Superman or Batman standards, but it will do for a diversionary two hours of super-hero fun. It still entertains, which is the whole idea of it in the first place.","7/10"

The plot was great, so was the cast, the effects, and the costumes! There are no flaws in this movie and I must give full credit to everyone who worked on it. Especially Sam Raimi who directed this movie brilliantly. I've got a gut feeling that Spider-Man II will be even better! Especially with Doc Ock. But too bad they took off the Lizard. He would've been awesome! Anyway, I'm glad with the rating that this movie got and Danny Elfman's score was beautiful. I hoped everyone else liked it!","8/10"
"Spider-Man","huntermartin-75875","5 December 2018","The time before the era of superheroes. Big Blockbusters were still trying to find a successful formula. Even Star Wars wasn't as successful as it used to be. Sure, movies like Blade and The Punisher came out but those were more aimed at Adults and still gained a bit at the box office but they weren't massive hits. Then in they May of 2002, Average moviegoers would finally see the worlds most amazing, spectacular superhero hit the big screen, spawning a new era of movie's to bust the box office. Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as the titular character, Spider-man follows the origin and first real challenge of Peter Parker and his web-slinging alter-ego as he deals with using his powers in normal life, and fighting his first super-villain: the cruel and dastardly villain of ""The Green Goblin!""
Spider-Man is one of my favorite superhero movies, mainly because it shows the right way to do an origin story. The first time we meet Peter is when he's about to get his powers, putting the viewer into the inciting action right away. After this beginning scene we see Peter's home life and eventually we understand his motivation and his decision to be a good hero when part of that home life is taken away. Despite his age at the time Tobey gives an accurate performance of Peter Parker, and a stellar one as The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
The best part of this movie though is that it accepts its campiness and silliness as a comic book movie and uses that too it's advantage. This is most definitely best portrayed by Willem Dafoe's performance as Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin, staying a serious, worried, sympathetic businessman and Norman and entirely transforming into a cruel campy disastrous villain as the Goblin. While the characters seem entirely different, Dafoe does a great job linking them together and even makes the Goblin seem like part of who Norman really is.
The two of these characters hit their peak at the end of this movie, where we see Norman grieve and regret everything as the Goblin but he realizes it was his fault for it happening in the first place, and Peter learns that you can't save everyone, no matter how hard you try from (of all people) his nemesis.
I still believe that while Spider-Man may not be the objective best Superhero movie out there, it is the best at showing what a comic should be in a live action scenario and has a solid lesson to learn. While sure it may not be as Great as Spider-Man 2 or as ridiculous as Spider-man 3, it finds a good balance in it's characters, truly personifies the Amazing, Ultimate, Spectacular Spider-Man, and its influence can still be seen in Superhero movies- and really lots of movies- today, 15 years later.","7/10"
"Spider-Man","yaszi-83296","10 November 2021","The movie some cheese factor. A lot of people say that it was a little cheesy because it was made in the 00s a pretty long while ago, but even then, movies weren't like this, I think it was done on purpose and I think it works great, it makes it feel a lot like a comic book movie.The music fits, the characters are great, Toby Maguire does a nice job at being a nerdy Peter. The movie has some flaws but overall is just a pretty simple superhero action movie that has an ok villain as well, played by the great William Dafoe.The movie isn't the biggest movie but it's just one of those movies that isn't to big, but is just a fun superhero movie.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","charchuk","21 August 2006","While spectacular when first seen, this movie does not age well at all. Even now, only four years after its opening, the special effects look dated and cartoony, and the story seems shallow and underdeveloped. It could be because of the release of much superior comic book films in that time span, or simply because the film dazzles at first and then begins to fade. Still, this is a very entertaining movie, albeit a bit cheezy and campy, which works at times, but not for the whole movie.Though the origin story is done very well - one of the best of its kind - the main plot of the movie is weak and pales in comparison. Part of this is the poorly done villain - not nearly developed enough, with a horrible costume to boot. Had the Jekyll-and-Hyde aspect been done better, the Goblin would have been much scarier, but now it just seems laughable. Speaking of laughable, the romance in this film is terrible - some of the lines are cringe-worthy, and it doesn't help that the actors are mostly wooden. Maguire is decent, but better and more believable as the nerdy Peter Parker than the amazing Spider-Man. Dunst is terrible, and unfortunately began the tradition of younger female leads in superhero movies. Dafoe is way over-the-top, but still enjoyable, and Franco is moody and unremarkable. Only J.K Simmons as the newspaper boss Jameson stands out, as he is both funny and true to his character.That's not to say this is a terrible movie. As mentioned previously, the origin story is very strong, from the original spider bite all the way until his superhero status. Though some of the drama is poorly developed, the comedic aspect of it is perfect, and suits the story perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, and the poor CGI is only really noticeable during the close-ups. And the film is never boring, and tells its (somewhat weak) story well. So, overall, an entertaining superhero flick, but nowhere near the best comic book flick ever.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","timurtaimur","19 June 2022","Character development, action, intrigue and suspense are all here on exhibition.Aside from some poor CGI in very few places, it works well for the most part. The direction, acting overshadow much of it and prolong investment in Peter Parker and both his misadventures and adventures.Though Mary Jane could have been more likeable, I can't fault the effort and sequencing put into much of the cast/characters.Willem Dafoe is an excellent choice as the Green Goblin producing some memorable lines still used today. And of course Spiderman is very true to the comics providing his cheeky gags and punchlines which are intrinsic to the Spiderman character.A must watch and second best Spiderman movie out there second only to it's sequel.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","elshikh4","28 August 2008","There is something genuinely SILLY about this movie. So let's review it to discover how it's not ""something"" inasmuch as ""some things"":_(Tobey Maguire) is not Spiderman, Superhero, or good actor, or charismatic star!_How he became Mr. web in my hand? OHH.. He had been bitten by a super spider. So let's have that naughty advanced spider to bite a lot of young boys and girls to have lots of Spidermen, Spidergirls, Spiderdogs. Surely one of them could be less provocative then you know who!_(Willem Dafoe) is kidding with us? Right? Because he is a fine actor, not just a bad joke wearing some kid's stupid green toy. He was having a rare schizophrenia to be a businessman at day, then some MacDonald's plastic doll at night!_Spiderman looks cool and athletic when he is in the suit, but (Tobey) looks just boyish. Another reason to believe that HE'S NOT THE MAN IN THE SUIT!_That script can be the cheesiest script ever. Actually, making a comic book movie does not mean writing it dully. It could've been more suitable to make it like it takes place in the 1940s. To tell you the bitter truth, it looked more like it had been produced in the 1940s!_The CGI was obvious, adolescent, and guess what? Silly._At the scene of (Spiderman) and (Green Hornet), in which they were talking over some building, why I felt like I'm watching a lousy puppet show? Even the kid in me vetoed: ""What kind of nonsense you're watching pal, get a life!""._Why all the characters, the situations, the events, the dialogues, the actors, even the action looked like old bad TV episode with primitive performance from everybody, and campy sense all over everything? A mystery indeed._Spiderman has an idiot alter ego, works at a newspaper, with nervous yet nice editor-in-chief who wants to know everything about the hero from that young journalist! Hallooo!! I hear echoes from Superman here, so why to make it again? As the old comics or not, they didn't find other solutions. Therefore, I got the deja-vu syndromes._ I didn't like (Kirsten Dunst) acting here; it was overdone._(Kirsten Dunst) and her last scene. I can't hold my laughs. At the first time I watched it, I laughed like a drain. Her performance was so awful, and (Tobey) was like a child at a school's play who forgot his lines to gaze smiling with idiot look on his face (I think it's natural), then he refused simply the ""sudden weepy"" love of her and left. I thought: ""You're such a fool! How dare you refuse her love?!, it was a miracle to find someone to love you in the first place!!"". That was illogical, and was acted badly, to a real funny degree!_The last shot, when Spidey is jumping all over the fake skyscrapers, and making a lot of fatuous CGI around, he is just unexpectedly jumping at us??!! Aside from being scary for some, I felt it was extremely funny and so impressive as a good example for this movie's unique silliness._2 sequels?? That's unbearable. Tells you a lot about a generation who wants more psychedelic SuperAnything even it was SuperMaguire!The year of 2008 witnessed the release of part 3, and after a while, there was the release of the parody (Superhero Movie). Although I didn't watch the spoof yet, but nothing could be sillier than the original itself!","8/10"
"Spider-Man","NuclearNinja","16 March 2023","I recently rewatched this film as an adult. As a child it felt like an obvious transition from the 90s cartoons to the big screen and I loved every second of it, the action and storytelling all true to what I knew and loved about Spiderman.As an adult I have been able to fully appreciate just how weird and whacky this film is. Sam Raimi really managed to capture a comic book feel in all aspects of the film. The dialogue and delivery is melodramatic without feeling silly. The action was punchy and over the top without feeling unrealistic. The costume and set design feels fantastical without looking odd. I don't think we have seen this level of subtle surrealism in a Marvel film since. Not even the sequels in this trilogy get it right.Even though the casting and acting is great all-round, Willem Dafoe steals the show, with a perfect performance for both Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin. Special mention J. K. Simmons for his famous J. J. Jameson.I'm sure I will come back to this film time and again.","6/10"

They talk, she leaves and is then chased down an alley by four randoms. Parker saves her and she doesn't even recognize his voice after having just spoke with him.

"Spider-Man","preppy-3","13 May 2002","You probably know the story, so I'll skip a synopsis.The movie was fun--it moved quickly and had great special effects. I was almost always interested...but there are two big problems with this film:1) Tobey Maguire--a horrible choice for Spider-Man. He's a good actor but he's so quiet and laid-back. Peter Parker/Spider-Man should be played by somebody with a lot of energy and more of a screen presence. I didn't believe him for one second.2) The final battle between Spidey and the Green Goblin--WAY too violent for a PG-13 movie. I was disturbed by it--there was no need to get so graphic.However, I liked everything else. Kristen Dunst was pretty good as Mary Jane Watson and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin) and drop-dead handsome James Franco (as Harry Osborn) are excellent in their roles. There's a LOUD pounding score too and some excellent special effects (which work better on a big screen than on TV). Basically a good summer movie--if only they had cut down the violence and replaced Maguire.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","general-melchett","8 November 2006","Spiderman is a really good comic book adaptation - it is well-written, powerful and intelligent. Instead of just being action and no substance, this film is made great by the fact that it focuses on adolescent problems - girlfriends, exams, that banter, and also builds on the character of Peter Parker - there are times when you really feel sorry from him. The opening scene on the bus is a good one - it captures the humiliation and shyness of being the last one on the bus, and also makes you think about Peter Parker, ""God, he's not a popular kid, I feel sorry for him."" Uncle Ben's death was hugely powerful and effective - nearly as moving as things in Schindler's List and other tear-jerkers. I have to admit, that bit did upset me a bit. (But I shed no tears.) So you feel glad when Spiderman murders his killer. The bit when Peter Parker and Aunt May arrived home from Peter's graduation celebration made me feel slightly strange - it felt pretty empty and solemn without Uncle Ben. This only makes Spiderman better - it also has a soul, rather than being just plain action with no emotional side (like the sort of rubbish we get in cinemas nowadays). And that is what makes Spiderman a spiffing film.There is no denying that Spiderman delivers on the action front - it does have a slight terrorist theme, which is pretty daring so close after the 9/11 atrocities. But Spiderman is mostly a tale of revenge, and this is brought to the screen in huge epic battle sequences that you enjoy watching - after all, it is what this film was made for. Comic book adaptations should all aspire to this. My only criticism of this movie was that there should have been a bit more action in it, but apart from that, it was absolutely flawless - there were many stories going on during the film, and we cared about all of them. Well, I did for sure.This film should be in the Top 250 - it should have beat out that awful trash V For Vendetta easily. Many films these days are trying to mix adolescence into their stories - this is one in which it is done successfully. Whenever there was a death in this film, I felt really moved - they couldn't have been done better. On the whole, Spiderman is an absolutely spiffing comic-book adaptation - one that tackles many areas, and one that sticks in the mind for ages after. A stunning job - I solemnly believe that this was better than the sequel. A film that must be watched multiple times before it really hammers itself home. 10/10","10/10"

"Spider-Man","freaky_dave","19 April 2006","Spiderman was a fun movie. It had some good action scenes, and good performances by both Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire, but I think it could've been better for a couple reasons.One reason is the special effects. I mean Spiderman looks like a bouncing ball as he jumps around and soars through the sky on his web. It just looked corny to me, and you could tell it was all CGI, except for one scene at night where he protects Mary Jane.The other part was the Green Goblin character. William Dafoe is a good actor, and he has a couple scenes here that were all right, but there were also some scenes where he appeared just as corny as the special effects.Also what about Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson. They appeared in the movie but had very little to do. That of course was improved in the second film, which is much better than this one.I'm not trashing the movie. I liked it enough to give it a 7 out of 10, but so much more could've been done to make it better. With the second one it was.","7/10"
"Spider-Man","Michael_Elliott","4 May 2012","Spider-Man (2002) *** (out of 4) The first film in the trilogy features Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker, a dorky whiz who gains superhuman powers after being bitten by a generically engineered spider. With his new power he tries to work up the courage to talk to the girl he loves (Kirsten Dunst) but then a family tragedy forces him into crime fighting and battling the Green Goblin (William Dafoe) who just happens to be the father of his best friend (James Franco). SPIDER-MAN is a very good comic adaptation that benefits from some great direction by Sam Raimi, a wonderful screenplay with real characters and actors that bring those characters to life. There's no question that there are some flaws in the movie but none of them are so drastic that they take away from the quality of the film. In fact, I'd argue that the film has actually gotten better with time because of how well-written all the characters and situations are. This here is especially true of the Peter Parker character because he's just not a dork turned superhero. The screenplay really gives him a lot of emotions to play with and I think you really start to feel for the character and then feel for the problems that come along with his powers. The romance with Mary Jane works extremely well as does his friendship with the Franco character and the problems that eventually happen in not only the love triangle but the issues dealing with the villain. Raimi does a very good job at juggling all of this stuff and he manages to make sure that the action scenes live up to the expectation of fans but at the same time they never outdo the story and characters. It certainly doesn't hurt that the casting was so perfect. Maguire has no problems playing both the dork as well as the action hero and that laid back style of his perfectly comes to life in the film. Dunst makes for a good love interest as she just has a certain charm that she brings out of the character. Dafoe is wonderful, as usual, and he never has a hard time playing emotions or anger. Franco also does a very nice job as does the rest of the supporting players. SPIDER-MAN contains some very good action scenes and mixed in with all the human drama going on you're left with a strong entertainment.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","Grimbleton","5 January 2022","I love Spiderman along with millions of others, and I was just as thrilled when I first heard there was going to be a movie about my favourite web-crawler. Years later, after having watched it multiple times, I can honestly say this is a fantastic movie worth watching.Spider-Man is such a well-put-together film, despite the many forks and loops in the comic universe from where the source material comes from. Sam Raimi expertly covers an ample amount of Peter's life, his origin and paints an emotional picture of an average kid who's life begins to change. The computer graphics still hold up very well and the thrill of Peter putting on the suit and swinging from building to building is always as exciting as the first time watching. Additionally, Raimi made a smart choice to use the Green Goblin as the antagonist - using Osborn to weave Peter's personal and superhero lives together was Raimi's trick in proving that a comic book movie can be just as heartbreaking as a drama. And of course, I can't forget Danny Elfman's fantastic score, the theme something we all still hum every now and then to ourselves.I loved Raimi's take on Spiderman and loved Tobey Maguire's portrayal of the web-slinger, and now that we've gotten to see three versions of Peter's origin and life, I can genuinely say Raimi hit the nail on the head perfectly. Is this the best Spiderman movie? Not quite - but it's a part of the best trilogy for certain.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7 August 2009","I'm not saying I'm easy to please. And I will admit that this is well-produced. I won't go over everything in this that's potentially bothersome. They do get a lot in there, including the main point of the character. J. Jonah Jameson is perfect. May and Ben are pretty good. Maguire isn't satisfactory in my opinion, as either part of the role, though he is not as bad as he could be. Mary Jane is OK. The Osborns are fairly accurate. Dafoe's performance does bring up something important about this film, however; there's a lot of ham and camp in this. Perhaps not enough to turn a meat-eater vegan, or make you call your parents and beg to come pick you up, but it still gets to be *painful* at times. Also, the comedy... is it meant to be funny? It almost invariably isn't. The effects are generally nice-looking, although that whole thing about the actual costume of Spidey looking just like the CGI version... yes, and that's because it always looks fake, so it appears, in spite of that not being the case, as if every time we see the hero, he's animated. Plot is fine, and as an origin story, this certainly gets the job done. Pacing is reasonable. The action is cool enough, and the cinematography and editing are inventive and creative. Overall, this ought to please most of the audience, casual viewer and fan alike. There is a little potentially disturbing content. The DVD has TV spots, trailers, music videos, a comic/feature comparison, four special tracks for the movie, one with webisodes, a pop-up factoid one and two commentary tracks, one with Raimi and producers, and the other with VFX people, and finally the option to record one of your own. I recommend this to those it appeals to. 7/10","9/10"
"Spider-Man","anaconda-40658","8 June 2015","Spider-Man (2002): Dir: Sam Raimi / Cast: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Cliff Robertson: Spider-Man is a superhero of enormous ability yet viewed in the wrong perspective. Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker who secretly loves fellow student Mary-Jane. On a class trip he is bitten by an unusual breed of spider. Now he can scale buildings and spin webs. His nemesis is the Green Goblin who arrives, as most villains do, by freak accident. Exciting climax where Spider-Man is forced to choose between two factors with the stakes being extreme either way. It is directed by Sam Raimi as a departure from his Evil Dead films. Only Maguire brings a real emotion giving off bewilderment and a sense of awe as he struggles to perfect this new ability. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane basically plays a damsel and kiss Spider-Man upside down. Willem Dafoe as nemesis Green Goblin falters with little concentration on his personality glitch. This results in a lack of emotion where it should be in the conclusion. And it is no surprise that James Franco as the Goblin's son will grow apart from his best friend Parker with Mary-Jane presented as a wedge. Cliff Robertson provides the pivotal yet somewhat cardboard role of Ben Parker, Peter's uncle. Entertaining visual wonder about abilities and the web of pain that can occur if we misuse our gifts. Score: 8 ¬Ω / 10","8/10"
"Spider-Man","AaronCapenBanner","25 August 2013","Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-man with a sense of wonder and fun that he became the perfect choice for the role, though Willem Dafoe as his mentor turned nemesis Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin is equally good. James Franco as Harry Osbourne and Kirsten Dunst as love interest Mary Jane Watson round out a fine cast.Witty script captures the knowing self-awareness of superheroes and villains, and their place in a society that may accept, then later reject them. Director Sam Raimi clearly loves this character, and brings this material to life in grand fashion, with a memorable climax and final scene that sets up the franchise beautifully.One of the best comic book films ever made was a big hit, and became a trilogy.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","zetes","5 May 2002","Frankly, a serious, realistic film version of Spider-Man is an impossibility. How, pray tell, does one make a movie with a character like The Green Goblin or Dr. Octopus without making the audience laugh? That's why Sam Raimi was the absolute perfect director for the Spider-Man movie. He's got the most uncanny ability to entertain the heck out of the audience while they are laughing at how tremendously silly the whole thing is. This comes from the Evil Dead section of his career.Now, from the more recent side of his career, like The Gift and A Simple Plan, Raimi brings the ability to people Spider-Man with good characters. Some of them are straight from the comic book, sure. Rosemary Harris' Aunt May is a perfect version of that character. And Willem Defoe's Osbourne/Green Goblin. He's so cartoonish, well, let me reserve a special place later on to talk about Defoe's performance.Now, Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry Osbourne (Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco respectively) are amazingly well realized. I did the same double take that everyone else did when they heard that Tobey Maguire was cast as Spiderman. Huh? That kid from The Ice Storm? Well, he's been very good in several movies (he was also poorly cast in a few movies, too, especially The Cider House Rules), and Raimi obviously cast him because of his acting skills. He could have went for the kid from Dawson's Creek or something, but he was right to get someone who could actually act. Kirsten Dunst may be the most underrated actress out there right now. She's been in some for-the-money projects, surely, and this is another one that'll pay her big. But in the meantime she lands some great roles, things like The Virgin Suicides and Crazy/Beautiful. Even the weak stuff she improves simply by her presence. Spider-Man isn't one of her best performances, but she's good. I like the early stuff, her problems with her terrible parents. It's actually kind of disappointing that they leave that character baggage almost completely behind Mary Jane after they graduate and move into the city. She is more or less relegated into the role of damsel in distress at that point. James Franco, who plays Harry Osbourne, is exceptional. I believe that his character becomes a super villain in the comic book, and that suggestion is left with us at the end of this film. He projects a lot of personality, more than his character actually has in the script.Now for Willem Defoe. No, he's not bad. Exactly the opposite. This is where the film goes way over-the-top, deliciously so. The Green Goblin is a great villain. He's nearly at the same level as Jack Nicholson's The Joker. Willem Defoe has a ton of great scenes, both as Osbourne and as The Green Goblin. I love the seen where he has a conversation with his evil mirror reflection. Critics are kind of complaining about Defoe's performance, but I think it's perfect for the film.Another great comic-book performance comes from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper publisher with whom Peter Parker sells his Spider-Man photographs. His scenes are the best in the film. Hope he has even more next time!My only real complaints about the film are the generous steals from the first Tim Burton Batman film (the balloon parade attack) and The Matrix (the fire sequence). There are so many inventive sequences that it's unfortunate that they couldn't come up with two more original ones.Spider-Man, despite its small flaws, is the perfect example of summer entertainment. I am seriously considering seeing it again in the theater, something I never do for this kind of film. It's probably the only time that I walked out of the theater wondering why the sequel was taking so long to make!Word to Raimi fans: both Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi. They both have hilarious cameos.","9/10"
"Spider-Man","TheEtherWalk","18 November 2002","I liked this movie. It is extremely accurate with respect to the comics and tv shows. But there is something about it that I just can't put my finger on. Perhaps it is Tobey Maguire, who was good as Spiderman but awful as Peter Parker. He needed to show more emotion. Or maybe it is the suits which looked WAY too cgi for some reason. Green Goblin's suit was messed up looking. Or perhaps it was Spiderman's webshooters that just appeared on his arms instead of him having to build them. Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. I just think it is a little bit overrated. It needs some tweaking, so I'll give it 7/10.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","mymtproject","10 November 2016","2002's SPIDER-MAN is a marvelous telling of my favorite comic book character. When I first heard that Spidey was getting his own movie back in the early 2000's, I was skeptical that the feat could be pulled off. Thanks to the wonders of CGI, strong character casting and good directing from Sam Rami (a guy familiar with the source material), SPIDER-MAN was everything I dreamed it could be! Tobey MaGuire and William Dafoe feel perfect in their roles of Spider-man and his arch-enemy, Green Goblin. JK Simmons as J.J. Jameson is one of the more entertaining characters from comic book movies this past decade. He captures the cigar-chomping, sarcastic Daily Bugle editor in grand fashion! Other supporting casts are good as well, with James Franco as Harry Osborne, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and Cliff Roberson as Uncle Ben. You feel like you're swinging between buildings and dodging pumpkin bombs lobbed at you from Goblin's glider in the action sequences. The story line is easy to follow, has heart and is just plain fun! This one is in my DVD collection. It's not perfect but certainly close; a definite 9 out of 10 stars!","10/10"
"Spider-Man","thesar-2","15 November 2009","I should really give 2009's 'Avatar' a chance. When I watched the recent trailers, the blue fish people look really fake in the trailer and it makes me either not want to see it or go for a good laugh. In 2002, I said the same thing about 'Spider-Man.' Spidey looked so fake in the trailer and the action/swinging was so slowed down, I almost didn't see it. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance opening weekend and waited a long time in line. Man, I was not disappointed. Somewhere in translation, they sped up the action sequences and you truly believed Spider-Man was swinging from building to building, fighting, etc. But, there was more to this movie, much more.Director Raimi and writer Koepp added so much depth to the characters, setting and took Stan Lee's age-old teenage comic book hero to new heights, literally. I've always loved the talent of Maguire (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) but you really felt every blow, physical or mental, he went through. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) and Harris (Aunt May) were absolutely perfect from the comic books I grew up on. Oh, and I always love Bruce Campbell (aside from 'My Name is Bruce') so I am glad Raimi loves to continue to use him. Unfortunately, not everyone was pitch-perfect.Dunst (Mary Jane ""MJ"" Watson) was just ""okay"" though she did seem to act her heart out in each scene. (Strangely, I always envisioned her with rich red and curly hair ‚Äì of which neither were true, though she did have just barely a red-tint.) And what was with the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Dafoe)? Sure, in the 'strip he's either literally green or in a costume ‚Äì I can't remember him much, he was always my least favorite of Spidey's villains. I guess they needed to upgrade to make him more believable with a horrid mask (again, I'm guess, that's the best they could come up with) which didn't make much scene, since supposedly they made the suit/mask before Osborn went wacko, and it just happened to look sadistic? At any rate, they did a fantastic job, making you truly believe in Spider-Man/Parker and all of his troubles and triumphs while keeping to the core of the always-broke, always-bantered teen who's trying to do good and always vying for the girl (MJ.) Here we have the origin story of Spider-Man, but, like 'Superman: The Movie,' you won't see the super-hero in red/blue tights until about half-way through. You'll be fully introduced to this nerd, his girl-next-door crush, his living arrangement with Aunt/Uncle and the infamous bite that spawned the teen web-slinger.Meanwhile, in the movie's weakest story, Pete's best friend's Dad experiments on himself with some green smoke that, well, uh, makes him stronger and angry. Not Hulk angry ‚Äì though he's got the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde thing going on, but just upset at those that are against the green smoke in the first place and eventually, of course, Spider-Man. This is one of the same problems I had with 'Daredevil's completely underdeveloped super-villain ""Bullseye."" You're simply asked to believe these two bad-guys have some kind of super-power and that they want to rid the city of the hero because, well, it said so in the comic books.The only other flaw I could tell (and Raimi never seemed to correct this in the following two sequels) was the length. All three movies (so far) are way too long with scenes that could've obviously been trimmed. Granted, this one is the best paced one, but standing alone, it still could've been cut easily down 20-25 minutes.Nevertheless, the movie, as a whole, is highly recommended. The fantastic score (one of Elfman's best,) graphics, dialogue, comedy, romance & longing and the setup were all great. It was a perfect introduction to the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. It can easily be viewed by all audiences, and they did a great job of making it almost virtually timeless so it can be enjoyed by generations to follow.So, thanks Spidey, you not only saved the city and the girl (oops, spoiler), but you might've persuaded me to buy a ticket to help probably the most expensive movie ever, 'Avatar,' make back at least one ticket's worth.","9/10"

"Spider-Man","akshatpandey66","11 July 2021","Have a very vague memory of watching this in my childhood and loving it to the fullest.Rewatching in lockdown and was wondering if I would still love it or it would be too amateurish for me now. And it still is one of my favourites.The CGI forms a major part of the movie but it still has so much human element in it. The dialogues are great and the action is top-notch.The whole story on paper looks too simple with the basic structure of hero-villain-beautiful woman-happy ending type, and predictable too, but it is so well done and beautifully shot that you are interested to watch it till the end.Maybe it is not in the same league as The Dark Knight trilogy but this franchise was the one that drove me towards the fascinating superhero fictionalized world.","7/10"
"Spider-Man","OllieSuave-007","29 January 2014","I have not read the Spider-Man comics and don't know the character's story or origin, so this movie was the first introduction for me to the superhero. After watching it, even to somebody completely new to the comic book character, it was a pretty good and entertaining movie. Tobey Maguire stars as the nerdy and shy high schooler Peter Parker, who was bitten by a genetically modified spider, turning him into a more muscular and confident man with spider-like abilities that he must use to fight evil and the villainous Green Goblin, all while experiencing a tragedy in his family. Along the way, he attempts to court his high school crush, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).The acting was descent, albeit a little wooden at times, but I think it helped enhance the steady-going plot story. The special effects were neat and there are plenty of action to keep the story entertaining and exciting. I like the movie's motto, ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!"" I think that message couldn't have resonate with a better character like Peter Parker since has to rise to the occasion after experiencing the rough side of high school, tragedy and competition with his more popular and well-off friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).Overall, an entertaining movie which I think is the best of the three made starring Maguire.Grade B+","7/10"
"Spider-Man","disdressed12","23 October 2006","this first Spiderman is an awesome movie.it has a great story,a great villain and excellent music.the cgi effects were not quite perfect,especially in scenes where spidey is swinging along or leaping from one building to another.however once you are immersed in the story you quickly forget all that.Tobey Maguire seemed an odd choice to play Spidey at,first,but he quickly grows on you.Kirten Dunst does a decent job as the love interest,Mary Jane Watson.However,it is Willem Dafoe who steals the movie with his portrayal of the Green Goblin.the Goblin is a great first villain for Spidey.i do wish though that the had chosen a better costume for him.i like the fact that they stayed fairly true to the comic,and kept Peter Parker/Spider Man as a(sort of)normal human being with problems in his personal life and at school.he is someone the average joe can relate to rather than some godlike being.summing up,this a great first movie for Spidey's big screen debut. 10/10","7/10"
"Spider-Man","CinemaClown","9 September 2015","One of the first movies to pave the groundwork for modern superhero flicks, Spider-Man is an incredibly fun & endlessly entertaining action-adventure that brings its web-slinging hero to life on the silver screen in a truly fascinating manner after spending nearly a quarter of a century in development hell and, with its record-breaking box office performance, acts as a precursor to an era when superheroes would dominate the summer box-office.Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the story of Spider-Man follows Peter Parker; a high-school kid who after being bitten by a radioactive spider at a genetic laboratory begins to develop spider-like abilities and puts his new powers to good use by turning to crimefighting. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn experiments a power-enhancing drug on himself as a desperate attempt to preserve a military contract critical for his company's survival.Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man has all the ingredients of a summer blockbuster plus it benefits a lot from Raimi's dynamic filmmaking style that doesn't dwell on a single moment for far too long, keeps the story fresh, light-hearted & action-packed for the most part, plus never loses its initially-gained momentum. David Koepp's screenplay is no slouch either for it packs in a compelling plot & few interesting characters and the whole story is splendidly humoured.The technical aspects are all brilliantly executed. Camera-work is excellent for the most part for the chosen angles, swift movements, slow-mo shots & warm colour palette are correctly employed. Editing provides a frenetic pace to its narrative, each moment has a role to play, and its 121 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Visual effects team makes use of both CGI & practical stuntwork and it's amazing just how well it has dated when compared to other effects-laden movies released back then.Coming to the performances, Spider-Man packs in a very interesting cast in Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Willem Dafoe, J.K. Simmons & others, and many of them are pretty convincing in their given roles. Maguire does a terrific job under Raimi's supervision, Dafoe plays Norman Osborn with finesse but that Green Goblin suit is extremely off-putting, Simmons is a near-perfect rendition of J. Jonah Jameson from the comics while both Dunst & Franco do a fine job as Mary Jane Watson & Harry Osborn, respectively.Also worthy of admiration is Danny Elfman's outstanding score that captures just the right tone & feel of your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man's universe and brims with tracks that seamlessly integrate into the story. On an overall scale, Spider-Man may not seem as impressive today as it did back when it made its debut on the silver screen but it still remains one of the best offerings of its category and delivers a roller-coasted ride that's enjoyable, entertaining & highly satisfying. Far better than its decade later reboot, Spider-Man is summer popcorn extravaganza right on the money.","7/10"

I was going in not sure what to expect because I hated the Batman movies. But Spiderman, actually has a plot with characters you care about.(SPOILERS):  That fight scene at the end with Spidey and Gobby was so kick a**! I also loved the tender moments between Peter and MJ. Sure, Some of the graphics with spidey hopping around on the balloons looked fake, but get over it. That doesn't take away from the story. And this movie made me laugh. It isn't even a comedy and I laughed more in this film than a bunch of other films. The scenes when Peter is at school getting into the fight with Flash were hilarious as well as when he tries to shoot the web.(END of SPOILERS)    Can't wait for the sequel.

"Spider-Man","joelgodinho","14 October 2020","Spider-Man is a 2002 film directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst.Spidey has always been my favourite superhero, I loved the TV cartoon from the 90's and to this day I think that The Spectacular Spider Man is Marvel's best animated show (or at least tied with Earth's Mightiest Heroes for that spot) and the fact that it only had 2 seasons was a crime against humanity.I also really liked the first 2 films in the Sam Raimi trilogy, in fact the original one might have been my favourite. This is my first time watching that first film since I was a kid and it's still really fun but I don't like it nearly as much.The cast is in my opinion the best part, Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker, Willem Dafoe is fantastic as Norman Osborn who is also the villain Green Goblin, I know that he's a fantastic actor and has been in countless great films including The Florida Project that I adore but I think he will always be Norman Osborne to me, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Rosemary Harris are also really good and so is Cliff Robertson whose character's death is really impactfull and obviously though his part is very small in this film J.K. Simmons is awesome as J. Jonah Jameson.The story is interesting and full of fun moments however I honestly thought that the action sequences are a bit underwhelming though I did like the one when the Green Goblin forces Pete to choose between Mary Jane and a cable car car full of children.Also the way Peter reacts to his powers is really weird, for example he learns he can shoot webs and climb buildings and suddenly he starts jumping from building to building and even swings on a web, how would he know the web could sustain his body? We the audience know his resistance has increased and he would survive the fall and that the webs can sustain his body because we are familiar with the character but Peter wouldn't know that.7.5/10","9/10"

"Spider-Man","slightlymad22","15 January 2015","Sam Riami's ""Spiderman"" is a fun comic book movie, but it is not a great onePlot In A Paragraph: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who lives with his Auntie May and Uncle Ben, he hangs about with his best friend (and seemingly only friend) Harry Osborne (James Franco) and lusts after the girl next door Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst) Peter's life is changed for ever when he's bitten by a radio active spider on a school field trip. Once bitten he developed an amazing powers and transforms himself into the superhero Spiderman. Unfortunately Harry's dad Norman Osborne (Willem Defo) has also developed some superpowers and he has transformed himself into the deadly Green Goblin.I had a few problems with this, the first being the menacing Green Goblin looked like a bad guy from the ""Power Rangers"" TV show and at times you could see his mouth was not moving when dialogue was coming out!! The wisecracking, sarcastic Spidey from the comics is nowhere to be seen. The ending borrowed heavily from the comic book ""The Night Gwen Stacey Died"" but didn't have the courage to actually go through with killing off a main character. Another problem for me was, I didn't find Maguire's Peter Parker/Spiderman or Dunst's Mary Jane that interesting. Willem Defo and James Franco were much more interesting as the deranged Father and neglected son.Now on to the good parts. Defo and Franco were both very good. The action scenes were well done, and for the most part the CGI is not that obvious. Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and in particular JK Simmons are very good in their supporting roles. Maguire does well enough in both roles, and Dunst is attractive enough for us to understand Parkers obsession, and she plays a fine damsel in distress. I enjoyed Bruce Campbell, Octavia Spencer and Elizabeth Banks in their small roles. Overall not as good as it could have been, but still enjoyable enough.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","SoumikBanerjee1996","31 August 2023","It is one of, if not the most iconic creations created in the twentieth century in the comic book realm.Now, you may have your own preferences of who is the best Spider-Man, or you can initiate arguments over what universe does things better (This one or the Garfields's or Holland's). Still, you cannot deny the influence Raimi's Spider-Man had on millions of people around the globe. It had set the trends and inspired generations (especially those who grew up in the '90s and '00s), and that is something only a selected few could accomplish in their lifetime.And you know what was the reason behind this huge success? Although there were many, in my opinion, it was the simple story narrated in a simplistic fashion that did the wonder. There were no complexities, no grey shades to be found, and I honestly believe that made it more accessible and accentuated its already wider appeal.I am in no way implying that having multidimensional characters is a waste; they could turn out to be vital and almost always happen to be critics' darlings, but considering the fact the narrative demanded a basic approach, making it relatively more straightforward was clearly the right decision.","8/10"

"Spider-Man","Reviews_of_the_Dead","13 June 2022","This is a movie that I saw in theaters and I loved it. Growing up I had collected some Spider-Man comics, watched the cartoon that came out in the 1990s and he was just a character that I loved. He was tied with Venom as my favorite. When this movie came out, I was excited. I've seen this movie quite a bit throughout the years. Jaime and I watched this in prep for Spider-Man: No Way Home.We get the origin story here by first meeting Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). He is bullied at school, but he's a smart kid. He lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) and he is in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). One day on a field trip, he gets bit by a radioactive spider that ends up giving him his superpowers. After tragedy and graduation, he moves into the city with Harry.Now I should point out that Harry's father is Norman (Willem Dafoe). He is a scientist at OSCORP and they're trying to create super soldiers. With the threat of losing their funding, Norman experiments on himself and becomes the Green Goblin.What I'll say is that this movie hasn't aged all that well, especially with the CGI we get now. Despite that, I think this is still a fun movie. Maguire does a good Peter Parker and I love the whimsical nature he brings to Spider-Man. There's a good cast around him with Dafoe as a great villain. I love that the Green Goblin bleeds over into Norman as he goes on. Outside of them, we have a young Franco, Dunst, Robertson, Harris, J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and even Joe Manganiello as Flash Thompson. This movie isn't as serious as it could be, but I think Sam Raimi shows how great of a director he is with this movie. The cinematography is probably the best part to be honest.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","Movie_Muse_Reviews","27 May 2008","In 2002, one movie proved what no one thought possible: Superhero movies were a genre almost untapped in potential and capable of generating millions of dollars world-wide. ""Spider-Man"" showed that costumed crime-fighters have a multi-generational influence and a mass appeal if kept under one condition: they are about the people behind the mask. What makes ""Spider-Man"" a film that transformed a genre and a whole decade (so far) is that at its heart it is a story about Peter Parker, a normal, geeky kid who comes across great power (that he learns comes with great responsibility). It is an origin story, not obsessed with the action and what the hero does as much as why he does it. Director Sam Raimi clearly connects with Peter Parker and knows exactly how to portray him. Tobey Maguire is an actor that gets at that. There is nothing hunky or masculine about him, yet he is beloved in the role, because through him the audience connects to Peter Parker more than Spider-Man. That connection being so strong then allows for everything Spider-Man does do to become more interesting, exciting and moving. You are with him and Raimi every step of the way.The very reason ""with great power comes great responsibility"" has become such a heavily quoted line is because when the script hits you with it, you're totally ready. After some great action and an interesting story with a compelling villain in the Green Goblin (Defoe) and strong character relationships, ""Spider-Man"" becomes a hit with its final scene.

The movie is fun and funny, Raimi providing a fast-moving arena for the excellently realized CGI spidey to do his tricks (just watching it made me want to go buy the game for X-box, but I haven't gotten around to it yet).  He must face the Green Goblin, his classic foe, played to a 2-sided malicious tee by Dafoe, whose character doubles as a big-time weapons manufacturer.  Dunst and Franco are merely adequate.  That rare kind of superhero film that left me itching for the sequel -- bring it on, Marvel!","7/10"

"Spider-Man","thinker1691","28 April 2006","Having grown up in the 60's, I, like so many millions of young teens were introduced to Spiderman through the medium of Marvel comics. Now through the magic of Hollywood Cinima, American audiences are further introduced to ""Spiderman"" the movie. The imaginative comic writer, Stan Lee is credited with bringing his web-swing character to life and does a 'marvelous' job of transferring the lonely, troubled teen to the big screen. His original concept is that of a young, book-worm, nerdy teenager who is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. Nearly dying, Peter Parker, (admirably played by Tobey Maguire) awakens the following day and discovers that instead of killing him, he has been transformed into a super hero with astonishing powers. Everything from his spider senses to his incredible spider strength, Parker is at first convinced he can make some easy money, by exhibiting his abilities in an arena. Unfortunely, his perception of why he was chosen is changed when his seeming ambivalence turns to tragedy with the death of his favorite uncle. The film is imaginative and laced with action scenes which enhance the comic-book-hero's' exploits. With the additional talents of Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the film proves it is slated to become a classic. ****","9/10"
"Spider-Man","atinder","22 February 2013","I gave this another re-watch after seeing new re-boot. Well this movie didn't have much action the latest one and a lot more of story just scenes of fighting and flying. There were A lot of slow scenes in this movie, with some really good action sequences I do like some of story that taken away from this movie that wasn't in the re-boot. I didn't find this movie as dark as new one, Which I still do prefer Maguire as man. I felt like we connected a lot more in this story and cared about him (I can't say the same thing new spider-man) The Actions scenes in this movie was really good and very decent not over the top and don't drag for too long.The acting was really good from the whole cast. 7 out 10 really good movie","10/10"
"Spider-Man","Fluke_Skywalker","21 March 2015","Sam Raimi's genre re-invigorating blockbuster holds up reasonably well. Maguire makes for an earnest and likable Peter Parker. He's not quite as comfortable with the wisecracking stuff as Spidey, but Raimi doesn't really focus on that very much here. Dafoe's a little hammy, but his performance fits in well with the tone of the movie. I found my self swooning over the sweetly vulnerable Kirsten Dunst, so mission accomplished there. And J.K. Simmons... Let me just say 'Whiplash' should've been his second Oscar (mild exaggeration, but he owns).The action scenes are a bit lacking in the thrills department, but the F/X work holds up pretty well save for a few noticeably dodgy sequences. And Danny Elfman delivers one of his least annoying scores. But what ultimately makes it work is its heart. Raimi gets the crux of Peter's journey--that with great power comes great responsibility--right (it's one of the many things I felt the reboot botched). As a result, the story and the characters all resonate emotionally","7/10"
"Spider-Man","Chris_Docker","10 June 2002","Spider-Man, the movie, knew what it needed to do and got on with it. As a sci-fi comic-strip action adventure adaptation this is one of the best. I am reminded of the tagline ""With great power comes great responsibility"" when I see how vintage director has handled the special effects. They are colourful, emphasise the story rather than their own technical mastery and have a beauty to them that is almost choreographed in its appropriateness. Tobey Maguire, irresistibly cast as the young lad who grows up to discover he is ""Spider-Man"" takes to the skies with all the joy of an adolescent with a new toy. Kirsten Dunst is melt-in-the-mouth as MJ. The transition from comic book to celluloid is effortless and an achievement within the genre, with the assistance of veteran writer David Koepp (Panic Room, Stir of Echoes, Mission Impossible, Jurassic Park to name just a few). Of course, Spider-Man, no matter how well done, is not everyone's cup of tea. Nevertheless, it leaves Batman, Superman and even X-Men standing.","7/10"
"Spider-Man","aliceboy","29 October 2006","I should preface anything I'm about to say by saying I don't like superheroes. These men (and women) in tights are holdovers from when comics were aimed strictly at kids, but now are being read by adults. They cast the world in tones of black and white (or, in the case of this movie, red-and-blue and green...) and oversimplify morality in a way only the real-life comic logic of organised religion does better. This said, I have to admit that I liked this movie. I worked in a comic shop for 10 years, and during that time witnessed the beginning of the recent boom in comic-book movies. Customers would get completely worked up over the latest spandex thriller to hit the big screen, but I'm only catching these movies years later on the small screen. Originally, I hadn't planned to give any synopsis on this story, thinking that if you were going to see this and didn't already know the story behind the spider I had no sympathy for you. However, I then found my own wife had no idea how Peter Parker got his superpowers, so here goes... Mild-mannered ubergeek Peter Parker lives with his elderly Aunt May and uncle Ben, next door to his longtime crush Mary-Jane Watson(who doesn't have any interest in him, of course). On a field trip, he's bitten by a scientifically altered spider, and finds himself endowed with special spidery powers...and a buff new physique! Naturally, being a much-downtrodden teenager, his first instinct is to use these powers to impress girls. Or, more specifically, one girl: Mary-Jane. However, through a series of events, his own actions lead to his beloved uncle's death, and he realises what his late uncle said was true: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' He thereafter commits himself to fighting crime with his newfound abilities. Wackiness ensues...I mean, ADVENTURE ENSUES! The story, at its roots, is pretty true to the source material, for better or worse. On the plus side, the movie maintains the childish charm of a comic book; on the minus, the movie doesn't really surpass the childish charm of a comic book. My only real beef with this movie was probably just a technical limitation of the time (only a few short years ago) when digital effects were STILL not up to bringing this particular character to the screen. While Tobey Maguire pulls some great physical acting out of his performance, it becomes all too clear when the switch is made to a computer-generated 'person' clumsily climbing the side of a building or swinging through the city. I can only imagine such effects looking much, much worse twenty feet high on the big screen. Sam Raimi, who brought us the much-beloved 'Evil Dead' trilogy (and countless other truly crappy movies), is a good choice to helm this flick. His work in 'Army of Darkness,' 'Darkman' and others show he has both an understanding of what makes these stories appealing as well as an appreciation for faithful adaptation of the superhero ethos. The downside of this, is that Parker, arch-nemesis Norman Osborn, Aunt May and the others end up consigned to the otherworldly realm of comics. They never at all approach believable real-life characters, and this removes the viewer from the 'reality' of their world (both the viewer's AND the characters' worlds). Compare this to Bryan Singer's work on 'X-Men.' He managed to take the equally ridiculous other Marvel/Stan Lee icons and mold them into acceptable members of the world we live in. Sure, they have superpowers/mutations, but they also have believable personalities and interactions with reality. I suppose the difference lies in what you want from your superhero: for a reasonable adaptation of the superhero into our world, see the 'X-Men' movies; for pure escapist fantasy, see 'Spider-Man.' Either way, you're not liable to be disappointed as both pack thrills and visual excitement into their brightly coloured packages.","8/10"
"Spider-Man","Agent10","3 May 2002","-contains spoilers-Wow! What a waste of money, talent and film stock. Many elements have to fall into place for me to completely hate a movie to the point where I feel like setting the movie theater on fire. Where to begin.Before the bashing begins, I will say Tobey Maguire was very believable as Peter Parker. Hhmm, that seems to be the only thing I can say that isn't snide or cutting. First off, Hollywood should now realize this whole ""replace-the-human-with-CGI-effects"" idea just doesn't work. It didn't work in Blade 2, and it certainly did not work in this film. Maybe imagination or blue screen acting would be more appropriate than trying to replace the human form with fake and awkward images of light and bit maps. It was like a bad video game. The dialogue also felt forced in many areas, especially when Parker tried to reveal his true feelings for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). They did it twice, and it still didn't work! David Koepp went from writing Panic Room to this slop! I haven't seen a dive like that since a Don King promoted fight.Typically, I rarely put down music, but then again, I think its time for Danny Elfman to go on some reunion tour with Kajagoogoo or whatever the heck the name of that band was he played for. Its obvious he has lost his touch. In fact, this entire movie wreaks of Batman, which was a far superior movie.The music was a blatant rip-off of Batman, and the movie even tried to rehash certain elements and moments. Let's see here: a chemical turns Willem Dafoe into a maniac, Dafoe's character trying to be nice to the superhero at the end before trying to kill the hero, the scene where the editor calls all of Parker's photos ""crap"" (which was exactly the same way Batman did it), the Green Goblin killing a group of people who want to rub him out of the picture (like the Joker and the other mobsters), etc. The similarities are far too numerous to number, the only difference is that Batman actually had some flair and magistry. This was nothing but a high, gloss picture with pretty images and mind-numbing editing techniques.I should have stayed away considering Sam Raimi had directed this film, but for some odd reason, I decided to follow the crowd. The lesson: be yourself and watch something else.","10/10"
"Spider-Man","Catherine_Grace_Zeh","21 November 2005","Wow! What an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed ride! That is the main thing that I can say about SPIDER-MAN. Anytime Spider-Man/Peter (Tobey Maguire) was being tormented, I felt sorry for him. This was because I could relate to how he was feeling. After he got his superpowers, I was really awed. It's hard for me to tell you specifically why. When he and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) kissed, I got all warm and tingly inside. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed ride that you'll want to see over and over again to all Tobey Maguire or Kirsten Dunst fans who haven't seen it. When you see this movie, hold on tight and prepare to be taken on a fast and wild ride. I guarantee you you'll be taken on a fast and wild ride.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","classicsoncall","9 July 2012","There was no way I was going to miss this film, but after reading a number of reviews by fans here I began to have some reservations. Most of that had to do with the retelling of the origin, and fundamentally I agree that this probably wasn't necessary after only ten years since the Tobey McGuire version. But now that I've seen it, I can say my second thoughts were unwarranted because this film provides an adrenaline rush with every spider web fired.I always had this unsettled feeling with the McGuire Spider-Man, or more accurately, with the McGuire Peter Parker. I found him to be too much of a wuss, wimping out whenever confronted as the timid teenager. With Andrew Garfield, I didn't get the impression he was OK to let things go whenever a bully came on the scene. With only one picture under his belt as opposed to Tobey's three, I'm going with the new kid in town.Whether intended or not, I also preferred the darker tone to this take on the Spidey character. Many of the action scenes occurred at night and better conveyed a sense that this costumed hero might be more of a menace than a friend. Peter Parker's dinner clash with Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) helped push that agenda and it worked pretty well.As for the main villain, a mixed reaction. There were times The Lizard (Rhys Ifans) looked a bit corny and other times truly menacing. It seemed to me that the film had trouble establishing the villain's proportion in relation to Spider-Man and other humans. In some scenes he looked like a monster, at others merely somewhat larger than Spider-Man. However the concept of cross-species genetics on which The Lizard came to being was handled rather well and proved effective.As always, my favorite moment in a Marvel hero movie did not leave me disappointed. Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance once again, this time as the oblivious librarian listening to a symphony while Spidey and The Lizard make a shambles of the bookcases in the background. I can't believe he'll be ninety at the end of this year.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","AmbushBug26","15 July 2012","Being a Spider-man comic book fan I can say that a lot of the stuff that happens in this story is true to the comic book Spider-man. Spider-man has web shooters, Spider-man likes to joke a lot, Gwen Stacy was Spider-man's first love, etc. So Anyone who is a fan of the comics will respect this movie on that merit, the merit that it was faithful to the source material while bringing in new stuff without losing what made Spider-man who he is.People who've only seen the Spider-man films and never bothered to read any of the comics. Won't like this film as much. They'll say the same old stuff. ""Why was this made? We've seen this already?"" Blah blah blah.Let me go off saying that behind Spider-man 2, this is probably the best of the Spider-man trilogy for one reason.....it avoids all clich√©s that the original trilogy didn't. In fact the film pretty much avoids all clich√©s at all. I'll try and explain a few without spoiling the film.Well first of all the woman in this film aren't morons. One of the main problems I had with Sam Raimi's films was the fact that all woman were pretty much portrayed as objects that Spider-man can save. None of them do anything helpful. Sure Mary Jane tried to hit Doctor Octopus with a plank in the second film, but she couldn't even do that right. That's not the case here. Gwen actually has a confrontation with with villain and she doesn't screw around, I won't say what she does but when I saw it happen I couldn't help but cheer. Finally a Spider-man film where the woman have a brain-stem.The second clich√© it avoids is being predictable. The original films basically have Spider-man going through the motions. Girl gets kidnapped, Spidey saves girl, Spidey defeats villain or jumps out of the way so the villain can do harm to himself. That is not the case with this film, a lot of the time you think one thing is going to happen but then it doesn't and the opposite happens.The third clich√© it avoids is having silly moments. The first trilogy had a lot of them, yes even Spider-man 2 (The raindrops keep falling on my head scene). Going back an having re-watched the Sam Raimi trilogy before seeing this one, the films are more like popcorn films. Sam Raimi is the master at making B movies and that's what the original trilogy was, an epic scale B Movie. With this film, they get a little more serious. There's not really any goofy moments that I can think of and if there are then it's usually played for laughs.Also THANK GOD They got Flash Thompson right. Sam Raimi used Flash so he could be the stereotypical bully, and at the beginning you think that's what Marc Webb plans to do, but then he shows that Flash isn't as big a douche as he makes himself out to be. Flash is one of my favourite Spider-man characters in the comics, and I'd like to say ""thank you Marc Webb for avoiding the clich√© of him just being a bully and actually making him a human being with depth."" The film also does other things right besides avoiding clich√©s. The actors all do fantastic jobs and I will go on record saying that Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-man and a great role model for young boys even though he has his flaws. Martin Sheen was great as an Uncle Ben who is kind, understanding, but at the same time doesn't take any crap. Emma Stone was great as the kind of jokey but intelligent Gwen Stacy who is a strong positive role model for young woman. The Guy who played the villain was great, The girl who played Aunt May was good in the few scenes she was in. Not a weak link in the bunch.So I've done nothing but praise this film so far, so why is it still behind Spider-man 2 in my books? Well the film does have flaw, mainly two. One it's rushed, the only one who really pays for it being rushed is the villain who only gets one line of dialogue to explain his motives and even then we're not sure why he's doing that. The second flaw is that it doesn't have this big epic feel that Spider-man 2 had, it doesn't feel like it was made to be a big summer blockbuster, instead it was made to be an Indy film with a big budget....although maybe that's why I liked it so much, it focuses more on characters than action.....hurm.....I'm still on the fence with that last one.The Amazing Spider-man is a good film. It avoids most if not all clich√©s, it's fresh, it's interesting, it's got characters you love to see and actually feel for played by fantastic actors, it's a great Spider-man film and it's sad that a lot of fans seem to be hating it right now. I honestly can't see what's to hate.Good film, go see it.....oh by the way.....I wouldn't recommend seeing it in 3D, there are a few moments where you're like ""Whoa cool"" but not much.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","TheNorwegianGuy","10 November 2012","I admit that I too didn't exactly get that excited when I heard that this was in the making. The Sam Raimi trilogy was a fun ride, and the idea of making another Spider-Man movie with a completely new cast seemed strange and unnecessary. When the cast was announced, I got a little bit curious, but nothing more.However, when I watched it, I got a whole other impression. I really liked it. The atmosphere was great, and perhaps a little darker than the Sam Raimi movies at times. I know many of you who read this will hate me for saying this, but I actually think this movie was a LITTLE bit better that the previous ones. Not much, but just a hint better. One thing is the cast. I really didn't like Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man that much. I didn't have a huge problem with him back then, but now when I saw this, I must say that I like Andrew Garfields ""version"" better. He's a little more tougher, both physically and in personality. Also, I think Emma Stone did good as Gwen Stacy. I liked her better as Peter Parker's girlfriend than Kirsten Dunst. The Villain, too, was great. I won't say more about him, not wanting to spoil anything.When I read many of the reviews in here, I don't see much positivity about this movie. I think that's unfair. At least, it's mediocre. Giving this a 1/10 is criminally wrong. At least I think so. If you wonder if you should see this or not, at least give it a chance. Don't let the bad reviews scare you away.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Hellmant","6 July 2012","'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN': Five Stars (Out of Five)The 'BATMAN BEGINS' of Spider-Man films, this reboot to Sam Raimi's blockbuster trilogy doesn't disappoint and I'd go as far as to say it's amazing! Director Marc Webb (who made his debut with 2009's critically acclaimed hit '(500) DAYS OF SUMMER') takes over the franchise with Andrew Garfield (of 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' fame) replacing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man. The film was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who also co-wrote 'SPIDER-MAN 2' and '3') and Steve Kloves (who wrote every 'HARRY POTTER' film). This film focuses entirely on Peter's high school years while he learns to first develop his powers as well as cope with the disappearance of his parents and who his father really was (unlike the original Sam Raimi film). It's also a little more faithful to the comic, in some ways, by having Parker develop artificial web-shooters that he uses to swing around on, rather than being able to produce them physically as part of his super powers. It also goes back to having Gwen Stacy (his original love interest from the comics) as the object of his affection rather than Mary Jane (like the Raimi films). Gwen is played beautifully by 'it girl' Emma Stone (the object of Jim Carrey's obsession). The movie, despite treading on some old ground, is thoroughly entertaining and powerfully well made. This story begins with Peter as a young boy (Max Charles) being left in the care of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) by his parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz), who disappear without ever being heard from again. Peter grows up to be a somewhat awkward teen (Garfield, who's way too old to play a teen) but is much cooler than Parker probably should be; he rides a skateboard and actually flirts (successfully) with his high school crush Gwen Stacy (Stone). One day he finds his father's old briefcase which leads him to seek out his father's old associate, a scientist by the name of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). Gwen actually works at Oscorp with Connors, which is where Parker stumbles into a lab experimenting on genetically modified spiders and is bit by one. He of course develops spider like powers and when his Uncle is killed makes it his mission to fight crime and get revenge. In this film he must deal with Dr. Connors' alter ego, the genetically mutated monster 'The Lizard' (which is the first time the classic Spider-Man villain has graced the silver screen), as well as the police, lead by Gwen's father Captain Stacy (Denis Leary).The movie does go over a lot of the same plot points as the original Sam Raimi hit but it delves a little more deeper in to them. I thought the first two 'SPIDER-MAN' films had a great amount of emotional drama and character development (which is why they're two of my favorite films) but this installment manages to outdo them. It really gets in to the character of Peter Parker, on a relatable level to almost every high school nerd (present or past) and Garfield plays him amazingly. I thought Maguire was about as good a Spider-Man as they could have casted but somehow Garfield manages to outdo him, mostly with passion for the role (he says he cried the first time he put on the costume). Stone is a little cuter and more adorable than Kirsten Dunst, I wouldn't say she's a better actress but it's definitely easier to fall for her character than Mary Jane's (due to Stone's likability). Sheen and Field are classic like always and Ifans makes a memorable insane villain. The acting is definitely a little better in this film but the script is also smarter and more complex and Webb's direction is impressively fitting. I wouldn't say he's as good a director as Sam Raimi but it's nice to see a different take on the series. Besides all the material that's already been done there's definitely enough new stuff to make the film interesting and thrilling. I'd say it's a better reboot film than 'BATMAN BEGINS' even, it's no 'THE DARK KNIGHT' but it is better than Nolan's original Batman film. If you're a fan of the series or the character (and Spider-Man is my favorite superhero) you're sure to be thrilled.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhcS7Q-CkYE","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Robert_duder","3 May 2014","Going back a few years when Sam Raimi's Spiderman released it was jaw dropping. It was sort of the spring board for the current excess of superhero films we see now. Most of us were definitively disappointed in Spiderman 3 but disappointed enough that we thought it should end the franchise and encourage a reboot only TWO years later? Fortunately for them the reboot isn't so bad and actually very entertaining and spidey fans won't be disappointed. I don't think its nearly as good as the original Raimi's Spiderman but then at that time it was new and fresh and captivating to see a live action, non-campy superhero on screen. The Amazing Spiderman does manage to make itself different enough to make you not feel like you're watching something you've seen a dozen times over. Its a different spin on the Spiderman story while still keeping key elements firmly in place (maybe Marc Webb should give Zack Snyder a few tips.) They also establish enough back story to make this a lucrative franchise for at least three films if they don't screw it up some way and get it scrapped like they did the first time around. At the same time of being different enough it isn't really that far fetched from Raimi's trilogy. It still has the same feel and intensity and solid special effects. As someone who despises CGI I didn't find it silly or overused (though its clearly used a lot) its done very well including The Lizard who is complete CGI.If they absolutely had to do this then Andrew Garfield was a great choice for the role of Peter Parker and Spiderman to a lesser extent. Its funny because I always thought Tobey Maguire made a great Spiderman but lacked as Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield makes a great, awkward, angsty teen Peter Parker but lacks something significant as Spiderman. I don't know what it is...but its something. Still he is at least good in both roles. Emma Stone is terrific as Gwen Stacy. Her chemistry with Garfield is perfect (though again not quite as good as Dunst and Maguire) and she shows once again why she's one of the best young talents in Hollywood. Stone outdoes herself in her role. Rhys Ifans is also perfectly suited as our villain Kurt Connors/The Lizard. Playing a villain (especially a giant Lizard) is extremely difficult to not make campy but Ifans plays it very seriously and is a very viable enemy. He absolutely brings the comic villain genius to life. Denis Leary is a great addition to as Gwen's father and Police Captain who is also somewhat of a nemesis for Spiderman and Peter Parker. His character adds a certain layer of depth to the story and he plays it very seriously even when he's being sarcastic and angry. It wouldn't even be fathomable for me to mention Martin Sheen and Sally Field, two absolute legends of Hollywood playing Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Sadly they are very underused and only have a few good scenes in the beginning of the film but I wanted to see more of them because of who they are as actors.Part of the issue I had with The Amazing Spiderman was perhaps the lack of emotional depth, the human side that we miss out on. The connection between Peter and his Uncle and Aunt isn't quite felt as well as it should have been. I wasn't moved enough when Uncle Ben was killed. However, this film gets definitively and absolutely better as it goes on. The end of the film is superior to the first part in every way. Its intense, emotional, action packed and jaw dropping. If the entire film was at the quality of the latter half it might have been a ten. The High School Spiderman/Lizard fight is legendary (especially with one of Stan Lee's best cameos), the scenes between Garfield and Leary and the final battle all make this an absolute must see. Marc Webb did an excellent job of creating something that could have and almost should have been a disaster into a viable and watchable franchise. I wanted to complain about how incredibly cheesy and melodramatic the ""crane"" scene was during the last scene but darned if it didn't make me get goosebumps and feel all warm and squishy. One thing is for certain, there isn't a Spiderman fan out there that can't say this isn't well done and very entertaining. There is some terrific Spiderman imagery (again especially towards the end.) Let's hope Marc Webb can hold this together throughout the franchise's life. Its greatest feat was to overcome was being far too soon for it to be made and it does overcome that. 8.5/10","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Ben_Horror","17 July 2012","With the success of the first X-Men movie in 2000, Bryan Singer pretty much paved the way for all the comic book movies we see today. That included a certain super hero movie made by Sami Rami in 2002 where a nerdy guy (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a radioactive spider and inherits superhuman powers. If Singer had paved the way, then Rami provided the icing on the cake: a faithful, smart, well-acted super hero flick that had as much heart and sincerity packed in as it had all those set pieces. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned, though underrated, third episode.Which brings us to what we have here: while not a beat for beat remake, you get the same story more or less with a different love interest and villain. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) sneaks into a research facility and gets bitten by a radioactive/genetically enhanced spider. He gets super powers and becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a doctor (Rhys Ifans) working at the same facility, is being forced to close down his research into tissue regeneration. In desperation, he injects himself with an untested self-generating lizard vaccine and becomes¬Ö a half man/half lizard thing. Spider-Man is then forced into action to stop him from spreading this contagion throughout the city of New York. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is the damsel in distress/love interest and plays a role in trying to stop the crazed beast.First things first: this is not a bad film. It's well acted by all the principals, has good effects, a scary and menacing villain, some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the Rami version. Parker is more evidently scientific and intelligent here. Also the police's notion that Spider-Man is a menace to the public is more clearly defined, especially in the scene where he disarms an officer. The new idea is that Parker can hear the movements of spiders and it's a good addition. So where does it all go wrong? The short answer: it's just that it's so¬Ö pointless. We had already seen the story before. There was absolutely no reason to tell it again. This movie could easily have been Spider-Man 4 with Andrew Garfield filling in the Spidey spandex instead of Tobey Maguire. But Marvel ‚Äì in their infinite wisdom ‚Äì just chose to tell the same story a second time. Going by that rationale, presumably Andrew Garfield will be cast aside like a disused sock when they inevitably choose to 'reboot' the franchise again in ten years or so. It is a scarily unimaginative tactic and it is one they will continue to do until there is a massive financial failure.This movie follows the same set up as the 2002 version: Parker being picked on, getting advice from his sage-like uncle (Martin Sheen), being bitten, getting his powers/climbing walls, and turning his back on a situation which unfortunately has tragic consequences for a family member. It's all a case of been there, done that. If you want to compare it to the Rami original, then the short answer is; as good as Andrew Garfield is, Tobey Maguire was better. Maguire filled the suit better; on occasion, Garfield is prone to looking thin and scrawny during several scenes. Even the suit looked better in the Rami movies. And those earlier movies had a heart and sincerity ‚Äì especially in the relationship between Peter and his aunt and uncle that you don't see here. Again we ask: why does this movie exist?And there are holes: there's a massive lizard running around, wreaking havoc; yet the police are more preoccupied with pointing their guns at Spider-Man ‚Äì despite the fact that he saved a child in a (surprise, surprise) rehashed scene set on a bridge taken from Rami's first movie. In another part, the citizens of the city (once again - in a bit taken from Rami's movie) unite to help Spider-Man cross the city using tower cranes ‚Äì despite the fact that there are buildings all around him. Heck, even the villain is initially a do-gooder like Norman Osborn and Dr. Octavius ‚Äì again from the Rami movies.It also seems to pull inspiration from another super hero movie: Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) in that it's slightly darker, tells such a large origin story that just like Batman Begins, Spider-Man doesn't actually show up on screen for the first hour. So if you take two parts Batman Begins and add a touch of Rami's Spider-Man, the result is what you have here. Additionally, the introduction of the web shooters, while being faithful to the original comics and emphasizing Parker's intellect, is a bit of a mixed blessing. The notion of the web being an organic material rather than being fired from mechanical devices actually made more sense.It's not that reboots are a bad idea, they're not. In certain situations they can work well, provided for example, enough time has elapsed. But there is no point in retelling the same story if the initial release is still relatively recent. In addition, it helps if the story wasn't covered well the first time, or it was a bad movie to begin with. Going by this criteria, Marvel's latest cash cow is unnecessary on all three accounts.In closing, if you haven't already seen the Rami movie from 2002, go watch it instead. If you have seen it, then this probably won't live up to it and you will be left feeling a little underwhelmed. It's fair to say that for anyone over the age of eighteen, this movie will seem rather half-hearted and senseless; for those under eighteen, this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever. Yes, it's a movie that will divide opinions, primarily on the sole reason for its existence. Not a bad, or a badly made flick, by any means¬Ö just a pointless one.","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","thesar-2","4 July 2012","I don't have an argument that Spider-Man's origin story didn't need to be remade for I've seen plenty of very decent to mediocre reboots before. But, what makes this a worthless remake was that it backtracked on all that was good before it.Heart, soul, good soundtrack, excellent score, acting, chemistry, heroism, humor and quotable dialogue were present in the original Spider-Man movies ‚Äì and yeah, even #3. This movie lacked ALL of those. Heck, it even deleted one of the main characters and often hilarious: J. Johan Jameson. Shame.I was even willing to over look the obvious first hour or so that inevitably retold the same old story of pansy Parker, a love interest, the bullies, the Aunt & Uncle, the spider bite, the transformation and the first try-outs. Without anyone (and I guess me now) spoiling that, we all knew that was coming. But, what I didn't foresee was how blah it all was going to be. How boring and trite.And please¬ÖPLEASE¬Ö do not let the advertisements fool you into filling a seat for a movie you've seen before: ""The Untold Story"" was about as revealing as finding out about Ellen Ripley's all-but irrelevant daughter in the director's cut of Aliens.What the movie is trying to tell us is that Spider-Man is a hero, that he loves Gwen Stacy and that, despite how great the Hulk looked in The Avengers, a giant lizard man can look real on screen using 1996's technology. No apologies: I didn't buy any one of these things the script displayed. In fact, it showed so much and yet, so much felt left out. So many story lines began and either faded or we're given half-ass explanations.Don't get me wrong; I didn't full-on hate on The Amazing Spider-Man. Of the approximately 20 minutes (of 136) of screen time Spidey was on the screen, he looked¬Ödecent, albeit the shots still looked like deleted scenes from the previous series. And even though Tobey Maguire spun webs around Andrew Garfield's Parker, he still did a good job. I will even give it to both the script and Garfield: Spider-Man's signature sarcasm was funnier this time around.Is it redundant to give the synopsis since I already reviewed the 10-year-old original? Yes, except this time around instead of a green bad guy from Oscorp being human, this one had a green bad guy from Oscorp being a laughable CGI Godzilla offspring. Oh, and as much as I love Emma Stone, her character, Gwen Stacy, first introduced in Spider-Man 3, was so lifeless, you'd have to miss Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane.I simply cannot recommend this movie. Again, of the 136 minutes, 40 were good, but that did not outweigh the bad-3-D effects or 96 other slow-paced, unoriginal and uninspiring minutes.","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","g-bodyl","28 January 2014","Only five years after the universally-hated Spider-Man 3(not me, though), Columbia Pictures have decided to give Peter Parker and his alter ego, Spider-man a fresh start. This film is essentially quite similar to 2002's film, but also features a few differences mainly a personality change in Peter. I don't know if I like this film any better than the original trilogy. This film is action-packed, has a great cast, and a rather fun villain in ""The Lizard,"" but this film doesn't live up to the trilogy that gave Spider-Man a name for himself.Marc Webb's film explores the origins of Spider-Man and also unlike the trilogy, we learn more about Peter's past including what happened to his family. As Peter is exploring his past, he is lead to his father's former partner who happens to be too smart for his own good. Also, Peter strikes a relationship with the daughter of the police captain, Gwen Stacy.The acting is really not too bad. An Andrew Garfield/Emma Stone pairing is not as good as the Maguire/Dunst pairing, but they still do very good and it's nice to see some cockiness in Peter's attitude instead of complete nerdiness. The Lizard, played wonderfully by Rhys Ifans, is a good villain to watch. The rest of the cast rounded out with Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field gives this film some starpower.Overall, this is definitely not a bad film and it's very entertaining. But we must ask ourselves, is this a necessary reboot? Honestly, I would rather have seen a Spider-Man 4, but who's to complain. This is a solid entry into the superhero genre despite really offering anything new. But hey I was entertained and that is all what matters. I rate this film 8/10.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","thinker1691","19 November 2012","This movie "" The Amazing Spiderman, "" has been way over-due. Ever since it's initial creation by Stan Lee (who makes his usual Cameo appearance), audiences have been hungrily awaiting this new addition. This time, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) confronts a new and incredibly powerful super villain called, 'The Lizard'. Self created by a one armed scientist, named ( Rhys Ifans ) or Dr. Curt Connors, Spiderman unknowingly gives the fantastic formula to a desperate man who has been trying to invent a way for a human to re-generate a missing limb, without realizing the unfortunate side effects. From the beginning, the film has a dark, foreboding and sinister aspect, which pervades through the entire story. Indeed, this sequel returns to it's early history in that the audience is introduced to Parker's lost parents, as well as his present guardians superbly played by Martin Sheen (Who adds a bit of Panache to the movie and Sally Field. Furthermore, Parker is given a new girlfriend called Gwen Stacy and her father seriously played by Denis Leary. The movie itself is incredible, what with all new high flying action sequences, aerial effects and numerous exciting scenes. Although a bit heavy in using mostly nighttime exteriors, it does lend credence to Parker's equally somber state of mind. Over all, the film is grimly superior to earlier chapters and is therefore easily crafted to enthrall us. As a result, the cast and crew, have intentionally created a Classic in the process. Easily recommended to all. ****","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","cultfilmfreaksdotcom","3 July 2012","In one scene, right after a spider in the Oscorp Laboratories bites Peter Parker: he falls asleep in a subway only to be awakened by a random loser who (for some strange reason) places a beer bottle on Parker's head. A drop of water from the bottle rolls down onto Peter's face, causing him to fling to the top of the car and stick to the ceiling ‚Äì like a spider.Over a dozen people witness this spectacular feat... and what happens next? A lady gets miffed because some of the beer spilled on her clothes. That particular reaction sums up how amazing the entire film is. After fully realizing his powers and using them to skateboard with furious bravado outside his high school, Peter Parker (much too) quickly dons the Spidey outfit that seems more like a surfer's wetsuit than a real transformation.He seeks his uncle's murderer from the supposedly pivotal scene lacking the tragic fate of the protagonist's mentor in Sam Raimi's version. This doesn't perpetuate Parker into a vengeful vigilante misusing his powers, but gives him reason to fly around wielding his skills that actor Andrew Garfield never seems in any particular awe about. The SOCIAL NETWORK star, resembling Anthony Perkins had he become a melancholy hipster, doesn't give Peter Parker the underdog value Tobey Maguire successfully conveyed ‚Äì but that's the scripts fault. Parker's not a nerd or even an outcast; having lost his parents for mysterious reasons, he's simply not a happy camper.Other than the rushed changeling into the titular superhero, there's hardly any character arc for the good guy or the villain. Osco's resident genius Dr. Curt Conner's transforms into The Lizard so quick, running amok New York City like a raptor on steroids, there's not much reason, or worthy motivation, for his actions.But (all) this lack of purpose fits a movie that, when not wallowing in romantic melodrama between Parker and girlfriend Gwen Stacey¬Ö whose dad is a hard-nosed cop and a weak replacement for a much-needed human antagonist like J. Jonah Jameson¬Ö doesn't live up to the original film or the comic books that at least, for better or worse, had a good time.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com","1/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","hnt_dnl","1 May 2013","Hardcore fans of Sam Raimi's Spiderman can rail all they want to. THIS version of the Marvel Comics superhero, Marc Webb's THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN (2012) is BETTER! While I really did like Raimi's 2002 initial Spidey flick, I absolutely loathed the incredibly overpraised 2004 sequel. Thankfully, there is a bit more debate about which film is actually better, because I've always been in the small camp that believes Spiderman 1 is better than Spiderman 2. Part 2 regressed all the good will that Raimi built up in 1. And there is pretty much universal agreement that 3 isn't very good. But I still contend that 2 SUCKS. The huge difference that I already see in this 2012 reboot that is better than anything from the 2000s trilogy is that while the Raimi flicks TRIED and FAILED to have emotion and depth in telling the story of Peter Parker/Spiderman, Webb's reboot actually SUCCEEDS! TAS stars the pretty ""amazing"" newcomer Andrew Garfield (who was superb in The Social Network) as the well-known iconic character of Peter Parker/Spiderman. Peter is a bullied nerd whose parents mysteriously left him with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (superbly played by acting legends Martin Sheen and two-time Oscar winner Sally Field) as a child.Peter's father was a brilliant scientist working on cross-genetics technology that allows an organism to cure and re-generate itself by merging with another. Peter, a novice photographer who inherited his father's science acumen, accidentally stumbles upon some of his father's work in his Aunt and Uncle's attic, including a formula that solves the cross-genetic puzzle that his father's former colleague Dr. Curt Connors (sublimely played by Rhys Ifans) has been trying to solve for years. After sneaking into the Oscorp facility and passing himself off as an intern, Peter snoops into a lab full of test subject spiders, one of which latches onto him and bites him, giving him spider-like abilities: strength, speed, elusiveness, scales, web-shooting.Connors works for Oscorp, whose founder and leader Norman Oscorp is dying and in need of a cure, and so Connors is trying to use the cross-geneticism to accomplish this. With Peter's help, the puzzle is ""solved"" and Connors ends up using himself as the first human test subject as he has only arm, which becomes regenerated, but it also has enormous side effects, transforming him into The Lizard, Spiderman's first enemy.During this time, Peter, caught up in his work with Oscorp and bemoaning his parents' abandonment, selfishly chooses to ignore a robbery, which inadvertently leads to his Uncle Ben's death, so Peter initially uses his newfound powers to go an a rampage to find his Uncle's killer as he stalks the streets of New York on a nightly basis, bringing lowlife criminals to justice.A romance develops between Peter and his fellow high-schooler, the equally scientifically inclined Gwen Stacy (played with exquisite charm and maturity by the gifted Emma Stone). The Peter-Gwen relationship is really the heart of this film. Very beautiful and engaging. In addition to his Aunt and Uncle, Gwen actually gives Peter a purpose and direction. Even though in virtually every modern superhero film, the girlfriend always seems to find out the secret identity, this is the first film that I think does it in a truly genuine, clever, mature, and natural way, and not just for shock value or cheap effect. I dare say that the romantic aspect is really the MAIN reason why this film works, whereas in Raimi's flicks, I couldn't wait for the ""romantic"" parts to come and go to get to the action! Credit really must go to Garfield and Stone for having incredible chemistry and being terrific actors. The Raimi films are really juvenile by comparison when it comes to the realistic love story in TAS. Special mention should also go to legendary comedian Denis Leary, who does an extremely effective and refreshing turn as Gwen's father Police Captain Stacy, injecting the character with his trademark sarcasm, but also coming across as very commanding.Another thing this film does is that it literally builds Peter from the ground up as a hero, making him learn the hard way through attempts, failures, experiences, pain, loss, and gain. Even many times when Peter is wearing the suit, he still acts very human and down-to-earth. He has to LEARN how to be a hero by still using his own instincts and common sense. It's not just about looking cool scaling walls and kicking ass! Spiderman isn't Superman! The film also stages the action as realistic as possible, with a healthy dose of CG effects, of course. But, here, unlike in Raimi's films, every action scene makes sense and we get to see how Spidey must use his webs on ACTUAL surfaces! Not just magically touching the sky, the webs hit just about everything in sight: buildings, cars, windows, and even other people! Garfield is simply superb as the awkward, gifted teen-aged Peter Parker, who has led a tragic existence, but finds a purpose through the memory of his parents, his aunt and uncle, Gwen, and the innocent citizens of New York. I usually think sequels suck, but I patiently await the sequel to his underrated, under-appreciated, extremely compelling and original superhero flick!","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","billygoat1071","29 June 2012","For some people, it's questionable for Spider-Man to get a reboot. The first film of Sam Raimi's version was just a decade ago and some considered it as a cult classic. Though, one might complain for not being too faithful to the comic books. The first film rushes a lot to the story. Like, Mary Jane was already the love interest and Peter Parker immediately left High School. This edition tries to be a lot more faithful to the comic book. The result is great. The film works better in the drama. The pacing may be too quick in some parts but it's still fun and heartwarming as it suppose to be.If you've already seen the 2002 version of Spider-Man then definitely you won't find a lot of thing here new. The only things that are new here is Peter Parker's father and the new ways how Spidey's powers work. Unlike the original Spider-Man stories, the use of his powers is not as simple as it looks. Here, he needs a device to shoot a web perfectly. He accidentally sticks at objects. He always cause a lot of damage. But it looks credible. What's more credible is when he wasn't quite a professional swinger at his first fights.In some parts, it paces way too quickly and sometimes it feels rushed. This happens in the third act and the montages when Peter was developing his costume. The rest is pretty fine, but the quickness of the pacing of those parts is still noticeable. There are also parts that feels forced like Dr. Conners becoming evil because he became the Lizard. Aside from those, the film is good in drama. It has plenty of genuine emotion and heart. Even in the action scenes. One thing that never fails is the message of being a hero. It's not always about fighting crimes and saving the day. It's all about the hero's character.Andrew Garfield is indeed the best choice to play Peter Parker. He's a talented actor and he made Peter Parker a realistic character. Emma Stone is also great to her role. She made her character more than just a love interest. In other filmmaking, fans might miss Danny Elfman's music but James Horner's score is effective to the scenes. The action is fun enough and the CGI is works well enough. It has plenty of POVs to make it look exciting in both 2D and 3D.The Amazing Spider-Man is almost the best Spider-Man movie. It has an incredible hero and an incredible villain living in a world that is close to reality. He is not yet professional to his own powers. He is a teenager who needs to be responsible. The drama is more effective in this film than the recent trilogy. Although I complain too much about the pacing, the depth of the story makes you think that awesome set pieces and perfect filmmaking doesn't quite matter. Because it's a superhero film that cares more than just action. The action scenes are great but the mind blowing effect here is the heart and the man behind the mask.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","mm-39","19 September 2012","The surprise hit of the summer! Everyone was looking forward to the new Batman movie this 2012 summer! Batman turnout being a bust and Spider-Man is the surprise hit Batman was not! I am tired of comic book movies. The comic book movie has become the seen it done it before with the same old C G I effects. However, I went to see the Amazing Spider-Man because people keep saying Mike you got to see this film. After avoiding Spider-man over the summer I finally saw it. What a great film. Spider-Man is a great film because the movie is excellently direct were the old story is excellent told with new twists. The actors blend the character development into the story perfectly. Martin Sheen played a perfect Uncle Ben. The 3 D effect added to the C G I and give a new excitement to the usual special effects. The same old story told in a better way. I give The Amazing Spider-Man a nine out of ten.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","aharmas","8 July 2012","Great previews usually lead to great movies, and there's a fantastic preview right before ""Spidey"". When I first heard about Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone heading this cast, I thought that it would be amazing. This film's previews looked great. Here's finally, the end product, and it's for the most part a fantastic movie, and the only criticism that we can come up with is that too bad it wasn't perfect, that the villain was well, not up to the rest of the story. Originally, the fear was that it was too soon to remake it; then you hope some good writer is part of the package (Argent) comes in, and we can see his touch, giving each of the central stars juicy lines to make them real, interesting, and endearing.Andrew Garfield is the best thing that could have happened to the franchise. His eyes are full of wonder, inquiring, able to convey a myriad of emotions in seconds, and his genuine chemistry with Stone certainly makes us care about what could happen to either one. She is not a typical damsel-in-distress, and here's a hero who can shed a few tears in the right place without looking insincere or stupid. This is particularly important in the early scenes involving the incident with his uncle, and his yearning for his long-lost father.Yet the film is a lot of fun, specially in the learning stages of his newly-acquired powers, when he can't really understand what is happening to his body. ""Chronicle"" did this effectively, but there was always an impending sense of doom. Here's only our expectations about how powerful he might become, which leads to the point of his nemesis, a terrific looking being that is well, not very threatening, particularly in this summer, full of some terrific antagonists.The special effects are fantastic, and New York hasn't looked this great in years. Watching Spiderman swing from building to building, and his little adventure in the sewer system of Gotham City is exciting. The best we can say is that here is another part that feels just right. If only Lizard Man's ego has been unleashed in the way that a few other egomaniacs have shown up recently. Remember the psychotic Joker, and that prince from another galaxy demanding respect from his ""new subjects""? I loved the claws, but if the best you can do is scratch people with it...? Back to Garfield's acting... This young man is one of the best things to come out of England/Hollywood recently. He can certainly carry a film and make it better and stronger than it might be. We want to continue seeing his adventures. Let's just give someone or something more terrifying and more threatening to go against next time.**** out *****.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","DarkVulcan29","7 July 2012","I don't want to say that this was better than the 2002 Spider Man, I think they are both good in there own right, this film does things a little bit better than the first film, but both films where good in there way.Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) a smart 19 year old, with a huge chip on his shoulder, who has a secret crush on Gwen Stacey(Emma Stone), lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May(Martin Sheen and Sally Field), still trying to figure out what happened to his parents, only to discover that his dad worked with Curt Conners(Rhys Ifans), while visiting his lab, is bitten by radioactive spider, and gains the powers of a spider. Okay there is so much more that I do not want to give away.Andrew Garfield was great as Peter Parker, I liked the way he does not try to be carbon copy of Tobey Mcguires Spider Man, but playing the part in his own way. Emma Stone was super charming as Gwen Stacey, she really brought a lot to the film, and she and Garfield have incredible chemistry. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are also great here. Not to mention Denis Leary and Rhys Ifans. And the effects don't disappoint either.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","planktonrules","25 August 2012","I can't take credit for the summary--my oldest daughter said that when we left the theater after seeing ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". That's because with all the many, many super-hero movies out in recent years, this one loses a bit of something--especially since there are clearly better films of its genre (such as ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers""). It's decent but there are better products out there.First, let's talk about what I loved. The CGI was incredible and for the first time it really looks like Spider-Man is flying. It's very seamless and looks brilliant. Also, the Spider-Man costume and movements are all great.What I thought was lacking in the film. It's ALL CGI and special effects--and nothing much more. The characters and dialog just didn't seem all that important. And because of this, it's spectacular to watch but nothing more....nothing. And, while I think about it, why, oh why didn't they include THE most important line in any Spider-Man film--Uncle Ben's line ""With great power comes great responsibility""?! It is the perfect summation of who the character is and according to Stan Lee it is Spider-Man...so why is it missing?!","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","amalank","7 July 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man is supposed to be a reboot of the Spider-Man movie franchise. Tobey Maguire is replaced by Andrew Garfield in the protagonist role of Peter Parker. His main love interest switches from Mary-Jane Watson to Gwen Stacy, and the villain in this installment is Dr Curt Connors aka Lizard. As expected, this reboot goes back to the beginning when Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man only it is told in a rather different way to the 2002 movie. This time they also try to add a bit more character oriented storyline.Is it a good movie? Yes, particularly since I saw this movie in IMAX. This made the action scenes more exciting to watch. It also uses a villain that hasn't been used in the previous movies so at least it does make it different from the previous movies.Is it a successful reboot of the franchise? In my opinion, not really. It's been five years since the last Spider-Man movie came out, and ten years since the movie franchise was first introduced. Even when they made the announcement of this movie being made, I was questioning it because it's just too soon to make a reboot. For the same reason, this reboot is not refreshing. Without trying to give anything away, you can recognise that this movie takes some of the elements from the 2002 movie. The character oriented storyline doesn't add that much meat to the character of Peter Parker as its supposed to. Its easier to count this as another installment only with different actors playing the roles.I really enjoyed the first three Spider-Man movies, and yes that includes Spider-Man 3. This new Spider-Man movie is also enjoyable but it fails to refresh the series. It seems that I was right in thinking that its too soon to do so.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","phiup","9 December 2012","IMO, i think the super A plus to this movie is the realistic application of physics. It shows a more limited spiderman. He must operate within parabolic physics and they tie that into the story.I thought this spiderman was a more fun, spunkier, angstier Peter Parker. He was definitely way more nerdy than Toby Mcguire.The addition of Gwen was great and I really look forward to seeing how this franchise manages upcoming installments under the new label.Dialogue was slightly lame, key point being, ""Gwen! Gwen! I understand! Your boyfriend is a man of many masks!"" CHEESY!!!!My other knock was that it spent the entire time developing the angst of peter parker and didn't give enough development to Gwen, Aunt May, and Doc. Connor.I am a huge marvel guy, so i will continue to watch with a sense of forgiveness for the many flaws that Comic to Movie translations present.I am glad I waited for DVD because so few movies obtain that silver screen quality. If you liked this movie check out the other Marvel and DC titles. They are doing some decent work.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","ashecatlin","12 July 2019","This gets a lot of stick for being an unnecessary reboot and that would be the case if it wasn't so damn good.There is a lot going for this movie, everyone in the cast bounces off each other perfectly. The dynamic between Gwen and Pete was on point, it even brought the feels that I don't usually get. You can tell that they had good chemistry from the point they were introduced to each other, same goes for Pete and Captain Stacey wow. The dynamic was very interested, they actually had good reason to include him instead of shoehorning him into the story. I also love Martin Sheen, I actually forgot he was Martin Sheen and was just immersed by his performance of Uncle Ben. Massive props to Rhys Ifans, not only can he act but he can emote perfectly you can tell what he is thinking with his even having to say anything that was bloody good casting!I'd say that this is the best looking Spider-Man movie, yes that's included the recent Far From Home. For a start this isn't crammed with CGI, yes that is how the Lizard is done but the suit was actually made and looks great. That POV shot of him in the costume first is just amazing, the fight between him and the lizard was epic.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","freemantle_uk","11 July 2013","In a cinematic scene of superhero films and reboots one of the most controversial was The Amazing Spider-Man, the reboot of a series that was critically and commercially popular. The Amazing Spider-Man is divisive, with opinions ranging from it being the best Spider-Man film so far to being a waste of space.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a nerdy outsider who enjoys photography, inventing and skateboarding. His parents mysteriously run off in the middle of the night when he was young and he has been living with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) ever since. One evening Peter finds his father's briefcase which contents his research that he wanted to hid from mysterious forces. Peter is led to Oscorb, meeting his father's old research partner, Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) and he ends up getting bitten by a genetically altered spider giving his spider powers.When Uncle Ben is murdered on the streets Peter goes on the hunt for his killer, leading him to become Spider-man. But at the same time Connors is forced to test an experimental serum on himself, leading him to become the Lizard, a powerful creature that is a deadly threat to the whole of New York.Let's get the comparisons to the original Spider-man films out the way: the special effects are better, I preferred the hyper-realistic look of this version then the original film and Garfield is a stronger Peter Parker/Spider-man then Tobey Maguire was. But Cliff Robertson was a better Uncle Ben and Rosemary Harris was perfect as Aunt May and Field was not able to compete. On the whole I felt that the original film was generally a better origins story: I preferred that Peter was bitten by a spider in a lab visit and I especially preferred Uncle Ben's death in the original film because it had more emotional impact and handled better because Peter comes up a real dick in The Amazing Spider-Man.There are also comparisons to actual scenes and ideas between the original film and the reboot which will lead to some spoilers. We get similar scenes of Peter awkwardly using his powers when he first gets them, citizens of New York (crane lift operators) helping Spider-Man during his confrontation with the villain and Peter losing a father figure which results in Peter having to reject the woman he loves. There are even similarities between the villains as both men are scientist are forced to experiment on themselves and developed a split personality.The Spider-Man origins story is equal to Superman and Batman for well-known it is and there is less leeway for reinterpretation. I personally felt that it was a waste going through the origins story again because it is so well known, killing the pacing especially because it takes an hours before we get to see Peter Parker don the spandex. It would have been more effective if Peter Parker was Spider-Man and the origin was done in flashbacks. But once Spider-Man does show up the pacing picks up with gusto and director Marc Webb shows great confidence with the action sequences and special effects (even more impressive considering his previous film was (500) Days of Summer).As a comic book fans I would have liked to have seen Curt Connors' family, adding to the dilemma of Peter Parker trying to stop the Lizard without harming him too much and made Connors more sympathetic. I also would have preferred to see more of a snout and be a raging beast: but Ifans is talented actor and it is good to see him in a Hollywood film. Ifans did have a great sinister delivery as The Lizard.One more small criticism is some of the humour in the first half film which was weak, a little awkward and was topped off by comedy music. It was out of place for a film going for a more serious tone.Danny Elfman did supply strong scores for the first two films, particular giving the series a signatory theme tone. Whilst James Horner's score for The Amazing Spider-man does not quite those heights he still gives the new series some good music that is dramatic, soaring and triumph when needed.On the whole there are elements which The Amazing Spider-Man does improve upon the original Spider-Man whilst the original Spider-Man was better on other parts. If there was a way to blend both films together then you would properly get the perfect Spider-Man film.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","TheSquiss","6 August 2012","I have to admit I had low expectations for The Amazing Spider-Man. Yes, I enjoyed the first of Tobey Maguire's outings as Spidey back in 2002 but the quality diminished with each sequel to the point that I didn't care if a fourth installment came to fruition or not. More than anything, it was the feeling I had a mere five years after the last installment, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, of 'Why another Spider-Man so soon?' However, the decision to return to the timeline of the source comics and introduce Gwen Stacy as Peter Parker's girlfriend (instead of the more familiar Mary Jane Watson) increased the interest. Maybe this would be a new approach. Then the casting of Andrew Garfield intrigued. His superb turns in Never Let Me Go and in the more widely seen The Social Network certainly suggested he may have something new to bring to the part. The trailer clinched it for me, hinting at a Spider-Man Begins leaning. If Christopher Nolan could obliterate the camp, tarnished Adam West Batman with a completely reinvented trilogy, what could director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) create with The Amazing Spider-Man? It's not Batman Begins, let's get that straight immediately. Nolan's trilogy stands head and shoulders above all other superhero films at the moment and is unlikely to be dethroned any time soon. But The Amazing Spider-Man is a huge success and an extremely enjoyable first foray into Spidey world by all involved and this is down to some fine writing by James Vanderbilt (who has just penned next year's RoboCop reboot) and the courage of Webb not to rush into the action and villain chasing too soon.A large part of the film is spent meeting, understanding and developing a relationship with Peter Parker through his childhood, the loss of his parents, his relationship with his aunt and uncle, the death of his uncle and his decision to become the superhero and gradual evolution of his crime-fighting alter ego. We see that Peter is flawed. He's cocky at times, he's angry, emotionally wounded, damaged goods and incredibly lonely. When he's bullied at school, it isn't the obvious type of bullying that results in a dramatic conversion to prize-fighting champion, it's the slow, constant drip-drip that niggles, that eats away at confidence and distills the inner turmoil to anger that could easily become rage but veers towards sulky stubbornness and carries its own consequences.Such time is spent with the family that when Aunt May (Sally Field on fine form that surely must lead to more screen time in the sequel) rebukes Peter we, too, sit up and listen and when Uncle Ben (the ever-excellent Martin Sheen in another flawlessly strong and sincere performance) is murdered in front of his nephew, though we know it will happen and is only on a screen, it wrenches our gut and we know Peter's anguish for ourselves.When Gwen steps into Peter's life it, too, is gradual and believable. There are no great fireworks or sudden changes but a slow maturing of their friendship into something stronger. The chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone (so much more watchable here than in the good but overrated The Help earlier this year) is tangible and a pleasure to witness. They work together, they suit each other and one really hopes they stay together.Inevitably, the superhero must eventually take centre stage and the catalyst has to be an (almost) equally super villain. In this instance it's Rhys Ifans' Dr. Curt Connors, aka The Lizard, with a destructive agenda. So good has The Amazing Spider-Man been up to this point that it's almost a pity when The Lizard arrives at all. It has to happen and it brings with it an increased level of excitement and action but something dims, the quality dips slightly and it becomes a more predicable, certainly a more standard comic book flick.Ifans is dangerously close to panto villain at times but in his human form he is straight enough to offset the predictable swerves in naturalism and believability when he transmogrifies into lizard form. His make-up is better than the CGI and at times The Lizard's moves are clumsy and the facial expressions lacking in emotion. In the wide shots, however, Spider-Man's leaps and swings are far smoother and more elegant than in the Maguire years and are a minor annoyance when they are less than perfect rather than a jarring disturbance.The Amazing Spider-Man is very good indeed and I am, for the first time, looking forward to Spidey sequel but I'm guessing the real amazement will come next week when at last The Dark Knight Rises.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","cherold","15 December 2012","2002's Spider-Man was an awful movie, mainly due to an incompetent script. It was followed by the decent Spider-Man 2 but returned to form with another bad one, Spider-Man 3. That series was not the right way to do Spider-Man; this movie is the right way. While the 2002 film felt like it had been written by a committee who were neither familiar with the original material nor reading one another's work, this movie appears to have been written by people who repeatedly asked the question no one ever asked during the first series: ""does this make sense?""For the most part, Amazing Spider-Man does make sense, with a fairly convincing origin story (except for a lack of explanation as to why what happened to Peter couldn't be used to create millions of Spider-Mans). The movie takes its time as Peter transitions from dweeb to super hero, then it gets into a super-villain story that also makes sense, and (again unlike the earlier film) is exciting and well paced.The surprising thing about this movie is how serious Peter is. The tradition of the series is a wise-cracking good guy, but while Spidey does get some witty lines, the movie is better represented by the way Peter removes his mask in one scene to calm a child; it's more about the Spider-Man with a deep compassion and a need to make the world better than the Spider-Man who likes to swing through the air and beat up mutant creatures. I would have liked more wise cracking, but I appreciate the approach.Far better than the overrated The Avengers, this is a superhero movie done right. It is not the most memorable movie, and it doesn't have anything as notable as the famous upside-down kiss from the 2002 film, but it is very solid. And while in the week since I saw it most of the details have faded away, that's much better than that 2002 film, which created so many bad memories that I can still, all these years later, reel off a list of all the movie's problems.Watch this.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","ryokan_wc","13 July 2012","When i first saw the trailer of this movie last year, i thought- another Spiderman movie?, and again earlier this year- seriously, another Spiderman move?. In all honesty, i was not compelled to watch the movie- may be it was the trailer or that thought of how far can a Spiderman movie be different than the one produced about a decade ago? How 'amazing' can it be, as its title suggests?After going against the odds, i came out from the movie very pleased. In fact, i enjoyed the move thoroughly and felt very entertained. And i finally understood the word 'amazing' in the title- because it is really, pretty amazing!It is not one of those movies with excessive ZOMG factor, for sure. The movie is amazingly captured with great use of CGI. The first half of the movie explores the dark side of Peter Parker's family history in a fairly comical manner. I got to know about Peter's father, which was not much explained in the previous trilogy and i don't exactly read the comics.Then there is his high school stories of his love. The next half of the movie was gripping and fast-paced, with well angled shots to make you feel like swinging from building to building and climbing up towers- i watched it in 2D and i could still feel the height! This part of the movie focuses on the transformation of Dr Connors as the Lizard, the villain of this movie, who happens to be Peter's father's working partner. His wish to regenerate his arm goes awry, leading him to produce a biological threat that forces Spiderman to a race to save the people in the city.As i said, i was entertained. The movie was light hearted, like watching The Captain America, with brilliant cast. Andrew G performs magnificently as Peter Parker, to a certain extent, i felt him outshine Tobey M. He fits the character well. I enjoyed the scene where he first discovers of his special ability, particularly with the flipping of his skateboard. Much credits to Emma Stone, Sally Field, Martin Sheen and Rhys I, and director Marc Webb for taking the risk of rebooting this franchise. Watch out for Stan Lee in a show-stopper scene. Flash, played by Chris, gives me the feeling of a sequel where he will be featured in a bigger role- like Jacob in Twilight.Give this Spiderman a try. For a two-hour movie, this movie does not fall short and does not feel long. And a sequel is pretty likely- stay for the post-credit (duh! almost all Marvel movies has this).I have to say this one more time: The Amazing Spiderman is amazing.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","piratecannon","26 December 2012","When it was announced that a Spidey reboot was in the works, most people responded in the same way (namely, by groaning and emphasizing their contempt for Hollywood and it's lack of originality). Likewise, I thought it completely unnecessary to start from scratch, as Sam Raimi and company had crafted an admirable trilogy (the third installment being a take-it-or-leave it experience). With The Dark Knight Rises on the horizon and The Avengers having ruled the first half of the summer movie season, it seemed as if Marc Webb had accepted a fool's errand in attempting to spin a tale that, by all accounts, didn't need to be retold.Lo and behold The Amazing Spider-Man, an origins tale that's a much darker, more brooding take than its 2002 counterpart. This time around, Peter Parker is played by Andrew Garfield. Unlike Mr. Maguire, this Parker has a tangible chip on his shoulder. He's a moody teen who vividly recalls the day his parents dropped him off at Aunt May and Uncle Ben's so his scientific genius father could sort out a mysterious mess at Oscorp, only to never return. Peter has inherited his father's knack for figuring out how things work‚Äîalbeit in a more mechanical sense ‚Äîand, though introverted, is clearly a clever kid in his own right. As new insights about his dad's work come to light, Parker finds himself in the labs of the fabled biogenetics lab that his old man helped build. It's then that he is‚Äîwait for it!‚Äîbitten by a mutated spider.As you can see, the basic layout of The Amazing Spider-Man is very similar to what transpires in Raimi's feature. One key difference, however, is the decision to focus on Peter's father. This helps motivate Peter to embark on a quest to discover ""who he is,"" which ultimately leads him to the realization that his dad's intentions were noble. Another significant difference here is the tone; Webb and Garfield remove the slapstick comedy that made the original (the 2002 original, that is) a colorful, light-hearted affair. In its place is a decidedly more drab depiction of the Big Apple and its inhabitants, and‚Äî for my money, at least‚Äîa more compelling vision of how Parker comes into his own as the web-slinging hero of yore.So, even though there are plenty of familiar elements, the movie feels like a more mature take on Spidey that causal moviegoers and more ardent web-heads can both admire and appreciate.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","studioAT","22 July 2017","Remakes are a part of Hollywood, but even by Hollywood standards, remaking a film just over a decade after it was released is odd.But that's what happens here, with Marc Webb being charged with the responsibility of remaking the original Sam Rami film for a new (or slightly older) audience.Unfortunately there's only so many ways that you can tell the origin of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman, so in many ways this is just a carbon copy of what Rami and co had done actually quite successfully a decade earlier, and it means that audiences are playing compare and contrast throughout.Sally Field wasn't great as Aunt May, Martin Sheen was better as Uncle Ben. I didn't much care for Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker though, he seemed too cool for the role.The break out star though is Emma Stone, and it's a shame she's not in in it more.A fairly harmless remake, but you can't help but think that this has been done better before...because it has.","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Quinoa1984","9 July 2017","Once again we get the origin story of Peter Parker becoming the Spider-Man. Once again we get Gwen Stacy, though this time its a substantial character (something that even I'll say, as one of a handful of big fans, was a problem in Spider-Man 3). Once again we get a scientist who meddles too much into his own business and finds that what it changes him into is a living nightmare. And once again we have a teenager who can throw out the occasional quip - though Garfield's Parker is more jerkish in some of his comments than Maguire ever was - while taking out the bad guys, whomever they are. Oh, and of course we get to see (spoiler? no, not a spoiler, screw you, this is 50+ years old now) Uncle Ben dies. Derp.As I recall from watching this movie, the (must qualify here) first 'reboot/remake' of the Spider-Man franchise from Sony, on DVD right after it came out - I skipped it in theaters, probably I was too busy working that summer or something, I can't remember - is that this wasn't any crime against humanity, and it was probably more watchable and understood its world a little better than, say, Trank's Fantastic Four or the majority of something like Batman v Superman). Webb, pun intended, does a competent job with the character stuff involving Garfield and Stone, albeit I'd rather see them as a couple in a totally different film, so that one can excuse the action from being rote.At the same time, this also solidified my belief that, if movies last this long, we can go another, oh, 55/60 years before needing another Uncle Ben death scene again. Or, for that matter, Peter Parker in a skateboarding slo-mo shot. It's too same-old to stand-out from the pack, but full of too much personality to be a train-wreck or a fun disaster. It's a perfectly eh-OK-ish blockbuster, and despite this rating and a lot of game supporting players (Sally Field, Irfan Khan, Rhys Ifans... got paid I guess). I'll never see it again intentionally.","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","troy-manatunga","27 November 2012","Let's begin on a positive note shall we?THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 is been booked for release for the 2nd of May 2014. Marc Webb is indeed spinning this web absolutely stylishly as the viewers want it to be. Personally this reinvention comes too soon to the wide screen following the Tobey Maguire trilogy that unfolded in 2002.The base behind the reinvention of one of marvels greatest superheroes isn't a complex algorithm as the one created by Peter Parker himself in THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. It is referred to as the filming industry and if the financial potential is great why not make an extra buck? It would not come as a surprise to see Christian Bale hand down the cape to another crusader even as Nolan wraps up BATMAN.Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1962 and as cleverly done by Raimi before, THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN is a differently narrated story of Peter Parker. As in the past his super powers are a result of a nasty bite from a radioactive happy spider and he is brought up under the guardianship of Aunty May and Uncle Ben. This is the only similarity one may draw from the Raimi Trilogy every frame of the movie from that point forward is a new spidey experience.Andrew Garfield is trusted with the daunting challenge of filling into the spidey suit from Toby Maguire. It has been a few years since and the old spidey isn't a neither forgotten nor lost memory apart from the 3rd movie that clearly lost its way (sorry Raimi fans, but you know it's true!). Lanky and tall Andrew is the skinny kid who wakes up to find him evolving into something greater. Loyal to the original comics (That I have owned myself) created by Lee and Ditko, Garfield strikes when the iron is hot with a lovable underdog that is Peter Parker. Outgoes the clueless girl from next door (AKA Mary J Watson) and enters college girl Gwen Stacey. Unlike the Peter Jane love story of 2002 the 2012 version of the Peter Gwen Chemistry is more often sidelined to allow time for Spiderman to try and save the day. This may come as a disappointment to some however this works in the benefit of the superhero. So do not expect the famous upside down kiss this time round folks, it ain't gonna happen! Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin is retired. The Lizard takes center stage as the new nemesis. Whilst Nano technology and providing weapons to the military was the business of Oscorp industries back then, this time it is a more noble cause that leads to destructions much like in THE RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. Dr.Connors is working on a formula to find a breakthrough in medicine. Dr.Connors connection and history with Peters father draw light to certain lose ends that Raimi failed to tie up in his trilogy. The fans will absolutely be thrilled with this exposure of Peters Past.THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN is an action filled extravaganza. It does miss out on certain trademarks such as ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" etc, instead it falls back to basics of the comics itself. Webb picked up on minute details of the superhero that Raimi skipped to iterate on. The webbing device was originally written by Lee and Ditko as a Parker creation and this is honored in THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. A must watch movie of 2012 and is on par with the 2002 production. The obvious question I need to answer is what movie I prefer better. To me THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN tops the predecessor by a minimum of a half start rating. Why? Simply because there is more Spiderman and much less Peter Parker.TITLE: THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN DIRECTED BY: MARC WEBB STARRING: ANDREW GARFIELD, EMMA STONE and RHYS IFANS RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 136 MINUTES","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","japamo","26 November 2013","Initially, like many people, my knee-jerk response to ""The Amazing Spiderman"" (hereafter TAS) was ""unnecessary and redundant"". I felt that Tobey Maguire's interpretation on the famed arachnoid (and Peter Parker) was thoroughly satisfying and complete. Therefore, I didn't bother seeing TAS at the Cineplex. But recently on cable, Encore was periodically showing TAS and, eventually giving into my curiosity, sat down one Saturday morning to give TAS a chance. Now I wish I had seen TAS in the movie theatre. Although it covers the usual Spidey origin trajectory (nerdy but brainy loner, loving aunt/uncle, bite from genetically altered spider, subsequent infusion of powers and confidence, emergence of outlandish but deadly villain), I think TAS does a more touching, affecting, and dare I say it, grittily realistic depiction of Spiderman, and more importantly, Peter Parker.Too often, superheroes eclipse their alter egos and give us the often mistaken impression that without their powers, they are nobodies (""Hero to Zero"", you might say). Many superhero movies seem to reflect that impression and somewhat rush the origin story so that we can get to the exciting hero as quickly as possible. I think Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman"" did that to some extent, acknowledging but accelerating Maguire's Peter Parker angst, sorrow, and alienation so that people didn't feel too down and could get to see their high-swinging, inspirational hero as soon as possible. Director Mark Webb's TAS takes more deliberate, measured time in revealing Spidey because I think he wants the audience to realize that Peter Parker is an amazing kid way before the fateful spider gets to him.So instead of rushing through the tense high school drama to get to college, as Maguire's Parker did, Andrew Garfield's Parker remains in high school and emotionally, uncomfortably, but convincingly reminds us how harrowing that environment can be, especially to a reserved, sometimes inarticulate loner and orphan. And yet, Peter is far from pathetic. In TAS, he is a skilled photographer and skateboarder. He is also an accomplished science student, and he proves it when he deciphers his late parents' science papers, formulas, and algorithms, especially the missing formula that completes amputee Dr. Curtis Connor's (Rhys Ifans's) successful but horrifyingly reptilian tissue regeneration. Of course, unlike Maguire's Spidey's organic webs, Garfield's Parker devises the web fluid and dispensers himself. Furthermore, Garfield's Parker conducts extensive research to learn why, as a 4-year old (Max Charles), he was left with his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), and begins to uncover an intricate connection between his parents, Oscorp, and Dr. Connors (and a mysterious stranger).Garfield, however, is careful not to make Parker into a perfect goody-goody. Perhaps because of his ""abandonment"" by his parents, Parker has rebellious, mischievous tendencies that would lure him into juvenile delinquency if not for his uncle/aunt and a potential love interest, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Parker can also be irresponsible, spiteful, and distracted, which leads to that life-altering, emotionally shattering family tragedy involving Uncle Ben. Although basically polite and respectful, Parker manages to antagonize and disconcert Gwen's father, Police Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) who (like Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson in Raimi's film), considers Spiderman a selfish, dangerous vigilante, despite Parker's earnest protests.Nevertheless, I think Parker earns the audiences admiration as he begins to rise above his shortcomings and use his natural talents (with a little help with his spider powers) to balance, juggle, and reconcile his personal, romantic, and ""professional"" problems. In fact, I believe that Parker is such an intriguing character on his own, the movie would still be involving and entertaining even if Parker tackled his problems without his powers. As Uncle Ben's posthumous voicemail on Parker's cell phone mentions, Peter was always destined for great things. The spider powers just make his life a little more interesting.P.S.: Commenting upon the Lizard's appearance in the movie, I personally had no complaints. As a cross between a Komodo dragon and the Hulk, the Lizard sported a too-human face, according to some detractors. I think that was essential to convey the Lizard's/Dr. Connors latent, if somewhat misguided, humanity and his final, merciful treatment of Parker/Spiderman. If the Lizard had had to speak and show his feelings with a snout like, say, a Velociraptor, I think it would have less effective, and even a bit laughable.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","colm-hearne365","3 September 2012","Like a lot of people, I didn't like how they were starting the Spider- Man movies from the beginning again but when I heard that it would be more true to the comics, I really began to look forward to it and it really lived up to my expectations with its cast, script, action and directing. But I still enjoy the original Spider-Man trilogy, except Spider-Man 3 which disappointed many fans. But I can admit even the first two movies got cheesy at times, particularly the acting and directing. And I've even heard that some people didn't like the trilogy for how campy they were or how untrue to the comics they were.But I mean I thought Tobey Maguire was too weak and didn't really fit the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he acted too much like a geek. Kirsten Dunst was a good choice for Mary Jane but as the movies went on she became annoying and selfish, especially in the third one and I didn't like how she acted so helpless.But I really think, like most people, that Andrew Garfield is amazing as Spider-Man/Peter Parker because he fits the character better and more importantly he's a better actor. And I love how he acted more of a wiseguy, which Spider-Man is supposed to be. And Emma Stone was an even better lead lady as Gwen Stacy because she actually helped out. And Rhys Ifans did very well and maybe even kind of intimidating as Dr. Connors/The Lizard. The battle scenes and special effects are amazing with The Lizard and Spider-Man were really exciting and had me at the edge of my seat.Some of the thing that makes this movie better than the 2002 one, is that it has more to do with Peter's parents, who were never mentioned in the trilogy. And we actually get to see Uncle Ben get shot. And there more funny parts as well. The Stan Lee cameo was the funniest. And of course, the story of is more true to the comics as well. I know some people found The Amazing Spider-Man disappointing or they prefer the original trilogy but I think people should be giving this movie more credit even though some parts were kind of similar to the Spider-Man of 2002. But I mean it's like the Spider-Man version of Batman Begins, in fact it probably should be on IMDb's Top 250 if The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises. I mean it's much gritter, funnier, and more mature and more realistic than the trilogy.Not to mention it's one of the most anticipated and best movies of 2012. I see a bright future for our fellow wall-crawler and hopefully he'll get to be in The Avengers.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","claudio_carvalho","10 November 2012","The trilogy of the Spider-Man by Sam Raimi is very faithful to the comic book's hero from my childhood. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not a bad movie, but is a fast-paced reinvention of the hero and therefore I was a little disappointed with the story.Peter Parker is no longer the outcast nerd that is bullied by everyone at high-school and needs to work to support his beloved Aunt May. He dates Gwen and immediately discloses his identity to her. After discovering that he has superpowers, he immediately jumps from the top of a building in a reckless attitude. He does not also grieve the loss of his Uncle Ben. There are many other differences regarding the original Spider-Man.The best that this film offers are the top-notch special effects that are very impressive. The story is only reasonable and I prefer Sam Raimi's movies. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Espetacular Homem-Aranha"" (""The Spectacular Spider- Man"")","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","jeddjong","26 June 2012","After Spider-Man 3 became something of a critical and commercial letdown and plans for a sequel fell through, the folks at Marvel Entertainment and Columbia Pictures developed a case of itchy reboot button syndrome and immediately put The Amazing Spider-Man into production to swing in and save the franchise. Many fans rolled their collective eyes and the web was abuzz with fiery opinions. Early looks and promotional materials seemed generally underwhelming, and the film quickly became buried by bigger releases such as The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises and Prometheus. However, this spider has become something of a dark horse and has somehow risen to greet detractors with a shot of webbing to the face.In spite of the poor first impressions, one would be hard-pressed not to admit that The Amazing Spider-Man is actually a competently-made, enjoyable flick. The approach that the aptly-named director Marc Webb of (500) Days of Summer fame took brings to mind last year's surprise hit Marvel flick X-Men: First Class, in that in combines the youthful appeal of teen drama with relatively large-scale super heroics and action sequences. This film does not repeat the mistakes of Spider-Man 3 ‚Äì instead, we have character development and interaction and clear and easy-to-follow plot progression. Spider-Man has always been a hero all readers could relate to, with his transition from outcast to hero and his various personal, real-world struggles. Andrew Garfield, sexy nerd incarnate, is an ace casting choice. The actor has said that playing Spider-Man has been his dream since he was a young boy and the role went to the right guy. Garfield has an effortless, genuine charm and his slightly lanky proportions do seem very reminiscent of the Peter Parker of the comics, particularly the Ultimate version. For all the strengths of Tobey Maguire's interpretation of the character, Garfield's somehow rings more true. Whether he's being a smart-mouthed do-gooder, a teen sorting out his issues with his well-meaning aunt and uncle or a young lover unsure of how to go about a relationship with his dream gal, Garfield is in great form.Speaking of his dream gal, Emma Stone does a similarly good job of playing Gwen Stacy. Many were confused after Stone was cast and then announced as playing a different character from Kirsten Dunst's. Gwen did pop in Spider-Man 3 played by Bryce Dallas-Howard, and is touted as Parker's first love. In an interview, Stone states that ""Mary Jane fell in love with Spider-Man, but Gwen Stacy fell in love with Peter Parker"". Gwen is smart, kind and funny, surely what every guy looks for in a girl, and her role in the story is just the right size. Sure enough, the chemistry between Stone and Garfield is among the strongest of on screen couples in recent memory and it's no surprise that the couple continued their romance off the set.One has to feel bad for Dylan Baker who portrayed Dr Curt Connors in Spider-Man 2 and 3 but never got the chance to transform into the Lizard after the cancellation of a fourth entry in Raimi's series. Rhys Ifans fills those shoes, and he marshals a tragic figure who hopes to better society and to fix his own perceived physical flaw. This definitely will push the excellent actor further into public consciousness, and he does a decent job. However, Connors' split-second snap from rational scientist to raving mad supervillain does seem a tad rushed and the design of the Lizard, as has been stated before, is pretty goofy. Also, the relationship between Connors and Parker, while given some attention here, could have benefited from a little mo re.The rest of the supporting cast is good too. Martin Sheen is easy to buy as the earnest, down-to-earth uncle and father figure who serves as an upstanding role model to his nephew, and so is Sally Field as his concerned, protective wife May. Casting these veteran film industry stalwarts was certainly a good move, especially since this retelling doesn't particularly focus on the two but does convey their involvement in Peter's life. Denis Leary is also well-cast as the Inspector Javert-type Captain Stacy, who could have been an over-the-top, ""squash Spider-Man dead!"" figure. Instead, Leary makes him a stern but well-meaning authority figure and gives him a good dynamic with his daughter and Peter. His resemblance to Willem Dafoe, aka Green Goblin from the first Spider-Man film, is a little distracting though.In terms of aesthetics, the movie looks sleek and dramatic ‚Äì director Webb uses his ample experience shooting music videos in the right way. While it could have been something like the horrid Catwoman movie, there is instead clever use of lighting and composition and the action sequences are kinetic yet coherently-shot. This reviewer isn't a giant fan of the costume, produced by the people at Cirque du Soleil (really) and the afore-mentioned facial features of the Lizard. The large amounts of digital effects supplied mostly by Sony Pictures Imageworks (also responsible for last year's Green Lantern film) are also a cut or so below expectations for a big-budget superhero movie, but these don't significantly hurt the end result.The film brings up the issue of Peter's parents but never fully addresses it, with a slightly ham-fisted mid-credits sequel hook hinting at what is to come. The Amazing Spider-Man has been marketed as ""the untold story"", which is rather bold given that it's only been ten years since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and five years since Spider-Man 3. Still, it defies expectations and is thoroughly entertaining. Untold story? Not quite, but well-told story? Definitely.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Prismark10","29 August 2014","Sam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy began in 2002 and a decade later we have the reboot with Andrew Garfield's more geeky hipster take replacing Tobey Maguire.However the film feels pointless, we have another origins story with Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider and learns to harness his new powers and then the tragedy of Uncle Ben dying and realising that with his new powers comes great responsibility.The villain here is a Green Lizard instead of the Green Goblin, a man wanting to regrow his arm but the experiment goes horribly wrong.The police pursue Spider Man as they believe he is a menace and Parker has a touching and believable relationship with Gwen Stacy whose father is the policeman pursuing Spidey.The film is well made, slightly darker hued after the rebooted Dark Knight films, a good mix of action special effects and humour although the CGI lizard could had been better but the film feels empty despite the efforts of Andrew Garfield.A soulless film made solely so Columbia Pictures can retain the rights to make Spider Man films.","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","buffingtondakota","2 January 2022","Really enjoyed this film. Obviously, this is a different take on Spider-Man than Maguire's or Holland's version. However, I don't see anything wrong with this version of Spider-Man. Honestly, I think this film is superior to the Maguire films; especially taking out of consideration nostalgia. First, the special effects are far superior in this film than they were in all 3 Maguire films, combined. Second, the story telling was way more in-depth and fully realized. The creators drive into Peter Parker's parents story/history. They give Aunt May & Uncle Ben a more relatable and fully realized story. The focus on how Peter Parker creates/becomes Spider-Man in a more ""real"" way, by showing him creating the web-shooters and costume using ""real life resources"", instead of in Maguire's version how he just magically made it himself with no comprehension to the audience why or how and the nonsensical bodily web-shooters lol. The relationships between the actors/characters feel organic and natural, and not at all awkward or forced like in Maguire's films. It truly felt like watching a comic book on screen rather than watching a big-budget Hollywood movie try to fame a beloved hero. This film felt like a DC/Batman movie at times, but not in a rip off way just coincidental way. Andrew Garfield gets a lot of slack for being the ""lesser"" Spider-Man, but honestly he was fantastic and played the character well. All of the actors played the characters well. I would strongly recommend giving this movie another chance and try to separate it from the nostalgic Tobey Maguire ""Spider-Man"" films. I had fun watching it and truly appreciated the hard work that went into creating this story/film.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Leofwine_draca","16 April 2014","I'm a bit ambivalent towards superhero films. Sure, they offer crowd-pleasing entertainment, but most of them turn into CGI monstrosities devoid of originality and wit long before the ending, and unfortunately the same thing happens with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN. And that's without mentioning that this is an entirely redundant remake of the Sam Raimi original, which only came out about a decade ago.See, I liked the Raimi trilogy of Spiderman flicks. Raimi brought his own directorial quirks to the films, making them slightly campy and a whole lot of fun. Here, it's all about earnestness, which is dull, and it quickly becomes obvious that director Marc Webb (a made-up name, surely?) has little experience of handling this kind of expensive material.Andrew Garfield has a knack for picking slightly irritating characters and that knack is evidence in his Peter Parker, who lacks the decency that Tobey Maguire brought to the role. The whole high school schtick is faintly embarrassing to sit through, but it gets worse about halfway through when the plot dissolves to be replaced by one CGI-laden action sequence after another. They're all silly and predictable, lacking the kind of choreography that a director like, say, Christopher Nolan, would bring to them.There's little else to enjoy along the way, either. I didn't like Kristen Dunst in the Raimi trilogy, but Emma Stone is hardly better, a bland blonde bimbo and nothing more. Rhys Ifans is impossible to take seriously as the bad guy, while old-timers Martin Sheen and Sally Field have very little to work with. There's no great insight into the characters or anything like that; in fact, this is just a kid's film that anyone older than a teenager will struggle to enjoy.","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","jamieradford","27 December 2012","I must admit I wasn't expecting much from The Amazing Spiderman. I knew the special effects would be great, but I had my doubts whether Marc Webb would be able to add anything new and interesting to the Spiderman franchise, particularly since it has only been a few years since the Sam Raimi version was in theaters.Well he did, and he didn't.The casting of Andrew Garfield as Spiderman/Peter Parker was a great choice. Gone is the klutzy and nerdy Peter Parker played by Toby Maguire in the Sam Raimi version. In his place is a normal kid (although very intelligent), who while not being the most popular student at his school is not the class dork either.This version of Spiderman also concentrates more on what happened to Peter's parents, and the effect that has had on him. The discovery by Peter of his father's suitcase and the ensuing investigation, is what leads him to becoming Spiderman. This investigation into his parents' disappearance will apparently be one of the common threads that will tie in future installments of Webb's Spiderman.Gone also was The Daily Bugle, J Jonah Jameson and Mary Jane Watson, and although they will all return in The Amazing Spiderman 2, due out in 2014, I did miss the rantings of JJJ, portrayed so wonderfully well by J. K. Simmons in the previous version.Marc Webb has instead used Gwen Stacey as Peter's love interest in his adaptation, played very service-ably by Emma Stone, and to be honest the chemistry between Stone and Garfield is much better than that between Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, who played Spiderman and MJW respectively in the Sam Raimi films.Denis Leary who is always good joins the cast as Gwenn's father ‚Äì police Captain Stacey, and as is becoming a trend in super hero movies, big name actors are playing the parts of the hero's parents, or in this case uncle and aunt, with Sally Field and Martin Sheen taking on the roles of Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Both, as usual give very polished performances.The excellent Rhys Ifans plays the one armed Dr Curt Conners, who used to work with Peter's father at Oscorp until he disappeared, and since then has been struggling to complete their work on cross species genetics on his own; unable to discover the final equation that will allow it to go forward.Peter supplies Conners with the equation, and following pressure from his boss at Oscorp tests the formula on himself. Of course it has unintentional side effects, and as well as repairing his lost arm, turns him into a giant lizard who then wreaks havoc throughout New York; as well as trying to turn everyone else in the city into creatures like himself.And the battle between Spiderman and the Lizard begins. As expected the special effects are great, and although I am not usually a fan of 3D, I highly recommend seeing The Amazing Spiderman in that format if possible, as the scenes of him swinging through New York are (no pun intended) amazing.Marc Webb has done a fine job. There are holes in the script and story, but they are not that noticeable, and it can get a bit clich√©d at times, but these things are to be expected in a big budget film such as this; however they can also be forgiven.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman, and am looking forward to the next installment of Marc Webb's version, which at this stage will see Jamie Foxx playing the villain Electro and is due out in 2014.7.5 out of 10","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","BA_Harrison","6 April 2015","Marvel wipe the slate clean to reboot their Spiderman franchise after the dreadful mess that was Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. This time around, it is Andrew Garfield playing teenager Peter Parker, who develops incredible spider powers‚Äîsuper strength, acrobatic skills and the ability to climb sheer walls‚Äîafter being bitten by a genetically modified arachnid. When his Uncle Ben is shot and killed by a convenience store thief, Parker builds himself a pair of neat-o web-slinging devices, makes a natty outfit, and goes looking for the murderer. Meanwhile, one-armed scientific genius Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) creates a serum designed to regrow his missing limb, but which accidentally turns him into a hulking great CGI lizard in the process.While this reboot isn't quite as terrible as the third Raimi film, neither is it good enough to warrant starting things all over again. The script fumbles the origins of Spidey and feels utterly contrived (Parker being able to build web-shooters thanks to a handy synthetic material invented by Oscorp, student Gwen Stacey working part-time at Oscorp, those crane drivers helping Spidey to swing across town, Gwen rustling up an antidote to Connor's serum in a matter of minutes), Andrew Garfield proves nowhere near as likable as Tobey Maguire in the role, and Mark Webb's direction leaves a lot to be desired: I didn't care about any of his characters and his forgettable action scenes are over-reliant on unconvincing CGI.I have yet to see The Amazing Spiderman 2, but the fact that the character is getting yet another reboot in 2017 just goes to show that this particular incarnation isn't doing the trick.","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","harrypup-28436","31 August 2021","This is a very underrated movie because it was rebooted only five years after Spider-Man 3 came out but I think it was fantastic film with Andrew Garfield doing a great job portraying Peter Parker and Spider-Man. His chemistry with Emma Stone was great aswell.Peter's involvement with Oscorp was very good aswell and he was more comic accurate.The only issue I have with this film is the villain. The CGI wasn't the best for him and he just wasn't the best villain.The night shots of New York were perfect and I loved the modern approach they gave with this movie.Overall, it was a great reboot and very underrated.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","hyunwest","8 July 2021","Andrew garfield and emma stone are amazing in it. This is the most spiderman-like adaptation that stays true to the original comics, and doesn't make spiderman look stupid like they did in tobey mcguire's or the mcu version. Spiderman should be very smart and strategic, and spider-like in his movement. TASM got this down the best, hands down. It makes me love and support the film more since it is so criticized and hated by some people, calling it the ""worst spiderman installment"". Im sure a lot of people feel the same way as me that this is the best one. We just don't go around looking for fights online.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","paulclaassen","5 October 2020","Although I probably should review 'The Amazing Spider-Man' as a standalone film, I can't help myself from comparing it to 2002's 'Spider-Man', since it is a reboot after all.Here are some of the major differences in the story: Peter Parker's love interest is Gwen (a character who first appeared in 'Spider-Man 3'). For some reason they decided to omit the Mary Jane character, as well as Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn. Peter's Aunt and Uncle doesn't nearly have the same characterizations as the original characters, whom I so loved in the first trilogy. They've also entirely cut Mr Anderson, a character so incredibly well portrayed by JK Simmons. Also, according to 'The Amazing Spider-Man', Spider-Man's webs are not entirely natural. Instead, Peter designed a device to properly utilize it, and there's even a flashing red light when he uses it...!!Andrew Garfield is a fantastic actor and I really enjoy watching him. As for the Spider-Man character in this film, though, he comes across as immature - even whilst in Spider-Man outfit (no, actually, especially when in Spider-Man outfit). Speaking of immature, Peter reveals his identity way too soon to Gwen - before they were even going steady as a couple. Their love story just wasn't believable (or engaging) enough. The film also has significantly more humor, which doesn't come across naturally funny as it did in the original. I found some of the humorist elements distracting and annoying.As for the action sequences, there wasn't really anything that blew me away. Much of the film's action scenes were completely CGI, and clearly so. With a running time of 136 minutes, the film dragged at times with uninteresting scenes. There were way too little actual Spider-Man action. This played like a drama with Spider-Man along for the ride.Rhys Ifans stars as Dr Connors, who becomes the villain The Lizard. While I have mixed feelings about this villain, it wasn't entirely bad, although maybe leaning a bit more towards the horror genre than fantasy. In its entirety, the film was entertaining from various perspectives. Andrew Garfield certainly made it worth the watch, thanks to his natural acting. Compared to the original 'Spider-Man', though, I favor the latter.","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","moviexclusive","25 June 2012","Ten years might seem too soon to reboot a franchise, but after the bloated and lacklustre 'Spiderman 3', going back to basics isn't that bad an idea after all. That's exactly what 'The Amazing Spiderman' does, booting out previous franchise stalwarts Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco for up-and-coming director Marc Webb (with only the indie feature '500 Days of Summer' under his belt) and similarly on-the-up stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. It's a bold move all right, but in this instance, one that pays off handsomely in the form of an enormously entertaining blockbuster piece of entertainment that we dare say surpasses the original.To be sure, this isn't quite 'the untold story' that the pre-publicity machine sold it as. Rather, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves (with story credit to Vanderbilt) re-assemble the key elements of Peter Parker's origin story for a fresh new take on the familiar. So once again, Peter is the nerdy and socially awkward teenager who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, who one day gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and develops superhuman powers, who uses his powers for play until his Uncle Ben gets killed, and then is thrust into a quest for justice to hunt down the killer that ultimately leads him to recognise the responsibility which comes with possessing such powers.Like we said, this is no mere rehash, and both Webb and his team of writers find opportunities at every turn to expand and adjust the little details that make a difference. Parker's father for instance plays a much more central role to the narrative, and the crucial wrestling episode between Parker and opponent Bonesaw McGraw in Sam Raimi's original is reduced with a wink to a brief moment that inspires his Spidey mask. More significantly, Webb tones down the comic-book feel of Raimi's original and goes the way of recent superhero movies by injecting a stronger dose of drama into the material.Though Parker's abandonment issues have always featured in the 'Spiderman' films, Webb's spin on it is by far the most emotionally poignant, drawing an intimate link with Parker's identity crisis that forms the backbone of the story. Indeed, that's also how the film's villain, Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), has been sketched. Both hero and adversary are characters isolated in their own way- two sides of the same coin if you may- not so different from the dynamic between Batman and the Joker in Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.Nonetheless, fans can rest easy that Webb doesn't take his movie down a similarly dark and gloomy path- instead, there is much cheer and spark in the romance between Parker and classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who proves to be a much more interesting character than Mary-Jane Watson ever was in three films. That's undoubtedly a result of the chemistry between reel-turned-real life sweethearts Garfield and Stone, but a key difference here is that Stacy is no longer just the sweet girl-next-door but a smart and sassy individual perfectly capable of being Parker's intellectual equal. Their romance has the zing of Webb's earlier 'Summer', and more than justifies why the commercials director was chosen over so many others to take the helm of this movie.Webb also has much fun with Parker's discovery of his newfound superhuman capabilities before the film takes a more decidedly serious tone- and a subway scene where the lanky teenager easily overpowers five other burly men in the same carriage (while ripping the clothes off another lady passenger) is neatly choreographed and adroitly staged. Ditto another where he hijacks a car-jacking thief in action (briefly seen in the trailers), which also marks the start of a tongue-in-cheek move he makes whenever some villain refuses to shut up or confess. In between the intricate webs of romance, comedy and drama, Webb weaves in another layer of action that perfectly complements the earlier elements. The first major setpiece on the Williamsburg Bridge sets the tone for the rest to follow- eschewing all-out spectacle for more emotionally-driven thrills- culminating in a harrowing rescue of a young boy from a burning car hanging off the side of the bridge that proves to be unexpectedly moving. Likewise the climactic sequence set atop a New York skyscraper (similarity to 'The Avengers' aside) has more emotional beats than you would expect- in particular relating to Spiderman's status as a masked vigilante- and ends on a surprisingly sombre note that brings the human dimensions of the tale to a fully satisfying finish.A huge reason why Webb's drama-centric approach works is the excellent casting. There's no other way to describe it than to say that Garfield is brilliant as Parker/ Spiderman. He nails the tongue-in-cheek one- liners, and navigates the character beats between tortured teenager and born-again superhero with admirable ease. We've said this before, but we'd mention it again- his scenes with Stone sparkle with verve. And not unlike Raimi's original, his scenes with supporting leads Martin Sheen and Sally Field provide some of the most heartwarming moments in the movie. To compare Garfield's performance with that of Maguire's is inconsequential really, and it suffices to say that Garfield brings a different, but no less unique, personality to the iconic character.Indeed, the same can be said of the film as a whole, reassembling the familiar elements of Spiderman's origin story into a refreshing blend of action and emotion. Working off the template of Raimi's original and inspired by recent character-driven superhero movies, Webb delivers an emotionally thrilling and adrenaline-pumping blockbuster that counts amongst one of the best Marvel page-to-screen adaptations. And unlike post-conversion efforts, the decision to shoot in 3D ensures that the POV shots of Spiderman swinging down Fifth Avenue or battling the Lizard atop the Oscorp skyscraper are positively vertiginous, adding an additional dimension of excitement especially when viewed in IMAX.","8/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","jkb851","12 August 2013","Many years ago, Stan Lee crafted a story with, perhaps the worlds most beloved superhero. Spiderman is the story of Peter Parkers life. It's the quintessential story capturing all essences of humanity, loss and life. A must for anyone human being to empathise with. The story of a teenager, not extremely social (who really), smart, bullied, has to suffer loss of family (his uncle) and is to be how you want to.This interpretation of that beloved story is brilliant! The direction is brilliant, soundtrack is great in my opinion and Andrew Garfield makes a fantastic Peter Parker, and his performance is well complimented with all the other likable cast.Even with it's drawbacks, the movie is great fun! :)","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Loving_Silence","17 July 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the best movies of 2012, so far. Great chemistry between the 2 actors, fantastic visual effects, memorable action scenes and a a new level of emotional depth, not seen in a Spider-Man movie. The movie constantly delivers on character development and thrilling action sequences. My low expectations were obliterated, what a surprise! Aside from the 3D animation looking fantastic and the film having a dark, complex feel to it that makes it feel more grown up, the primary reason worth watching is Andrew Garfield. Andrew Garfield was terrific as Spider-Man, he not only looks like Peter Parker, but he embodies the character. Something only a few actors are able to do. Emma Stone is, as always very charming and effective in her role as Gwen Stacy. The chemistry between them is so well done, and performed. The scenes between them truly elevate the film, as a whole. Uncle Ben, played by the veteran actor Martin Sheen. Sheen brings the intrinsic qualities of family love and togetherness to the movie. Rhys Ifans is great as Dr. Connors, although I felt he was a bit underused. Everyone works so well together, the cast is by far the best out of all the Spidey movies, yet. In many ways it represents an improvement over the Raimi films, particularly the misbegotten third installment, especially in its emphasis on the adolescent nature of its protagonist. Though Garfield is 28, he makes a credible 17-year-old - although Maguire was a year younger when he first pulled on the tights a decade ago, his Parker seemed conspicuously adult. The action scenes and the visual effects are totally exhilarating, believable and totally engrossing. Even though this reboot may be unnecessary, now I can't wait until The Amazing Spider-man 2. I sort of hate comparing this to the original trilogy because it is trying to be its own thing, but you can't escape the fact that it's such a recent reboot. However the movie stands on its own, as great reboot and a pleasure to watch! ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has everything you could ask from a summer movie. Action, romance, imagination and smart writing. 9/10","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","cricketbat","10 July 2018","When I first heard about this reboot, I wondered ""Why?"" Then, after seeing some press about it, I decided to give it a chance. After seeing the movie, I can now confidently say, ""Why?"" Don't get me wrong, I think Andrew Garfield makes an excellent Spider-Man and I always like seeing Emma Stone act, but this movie doesn't really add anything new to the franchise. In fact, at times it feels like the same movie as the first Spider-Man. I like The Amazing Spider-Man, but it's not really that. . .wait for it. . .amazing. Boom! See what I did there?","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","barok_232","14 July 2012","This movie is a cash-in.First thing that occurred to me was that I previously saw everything worth watching in the movie's trailer.For example, note that Spidey's swinging scenes which are spread out in the trailer ended up being one scene in the movie (the crane scene)!Also,I didn't see ONE new bit of action in the movie that I hadn't already seen in the trailer and if I did,it was not a highlight.It really gets on my nerves when Hollywood manages to fool me with an impressive trailer that I am going to see a good movie, only to discover that it's far from that.It is more than obvious that everyone's eyes are on the Parker character, played by Garfield.I believe he did a decent job with what he was given and if at times there was some awkwardness with the character,it wasn't his fault.The bad thing is at some points I got a ""Harry Potter"" feeling by him.The rest of the cast did well,Stone was great and cute,Field and Sheen felt like cameo appearances just to help the film sell more(although happy to have seen them),Leary was very fitting to the role of captain Stacey and Ifans was sufficient as Connors(again he did nothing wrong,not his fault that his character was poorly developed). I also got a question here: would a half-arm person lift his sleeve up to the point where his rest arm is shown unless he is a beggar on the street? I think not.As for the Peter-Gwen romance,it was cute but I honestly think it never got deep emotionally.The movie also failed to explain to me why Gwen got attracted to Peter.The film is about Peter trying to find the truth about his parents. I honestly couldn't care less.And besides,there are only repeated references of that matter and no actual clues to follow,another cheat sponsored by the trailer.The rest of the film focuses on Peter getting bitten by the spider (since the movie is a reboot) and then on the lizard matter. Comparing with the original Spiderman(Sam Raimi's) at this point is inevitable. The question is raised: is there anything more they could possibly tweak/alter? Couldn't they stick to the comic plot at all? It's as if they are changing everything no matter what.The result was to go worse everywhere since the Raimi version did amazingly well with Spidey's story.Huge example is uncle Ben's death.What was that?No guilt was established for Peter as nobody in the audience would assume Peter was obliged to stop the thief and Ben's death had no actual impact on him,just a shallow crying scene over Ben lying on the sidewalk. Since they like to alter things so much, I say, let Ben live in this one flick!Connors is underdeveloped,so his motives are not clear,lizard wants to turn everybody like himself, although able to talk (with fantastic pronunciation!!!)and be sane.I don't get if there is a second persona or a crazy Connors behind the lizard,the film doesn't really explain and the scene where Connors hears the lizard talk to him only complicates things more.The director,in order to promote this film,boasted that this film uses very little cgi technology if any.That is a big lie.Not only there is extensive use of cgi, it's actually also very bad.I can't comment further on this matter as it is something one has to realize on his own.What gives it away is motion,colors are OK. Gravital issues also occur as the lizard sometimes appears to be really heavy(Hulk-Godzilla-like)and at other scenes he climbs and jumps like a feather. The only action scene I enjoyed in its entirety was the car thief scene. There is no cgi there as far as I'm concerned and it is a very enjoyable scene overall(Garfield's humorous lines help too).The flaw there is how the heck did so many police cars get there so quick!.At this point I want to comment about the suit.I really hate it.Had there not been the Spiderman mask,I would never recognize the man wearing this suit as Spiderman.Mechanical (-electrical?) web shooters are indifferent although faithful to the comics(let's give them that),but I think Raimi's idea of giving Peter organic web shooters was a real improvement.Like I said above, in this new film they did EVERYTHING differently.The scene when Peter tests the web shooters is far from realistic as he chose to fall off a skyscraper in order to do that!.One of my first thoughts was how many times had the director(Webb)taken me to Peter's school and Oscorp.Most of the film's scenes take place either at school or Oscorp.I find this unacceptable unless this is a television series or something. Furthermore,Webb never seemed to understand what is important or not in this film and I believe his whole approach to this project was false.Few examples:Peter Parker being a skateboarder (!) while a genius geek at the same time.There are more than enough scenes after Parker was bitten by the spider where his hands glue. Spider sense was not portrayed properly.I could literally go on forever.To conclude, there is no stigma,style,interesting shots, there is nothing.I don't know where this guy Webb came from and I haven't seen his other movie, but he did an amateur job.Take out the CGI and production money and you have yourself a fan-made film.Christopher Nolan did another take on Batman but you can see he can direct,and his movies are really ""heavy"",meaning important and professional.I fear for what's coming next for the Spiderman franchise.It is certain that I will avoid seeing the future amazing Spiderman films.The biggest problem is that they do no honor to Spiderman and tend to destroy him before the eyes of us fans.","1/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","HunterGarza65","4 December 2012","This is the best Spider-Man yet.This Spider-Man film was the closes to the comics.The characters were really close to the comics.Why?Andrew did better in both Peter and Spider-Man.Proof!Andrew did better as Peter: Andrew's Peter looked more to the comics and plus he created that ""cuotion"" that turned Connors into Lizard.HeÔªø also created the Web- Shooters meaning he used his brain to create them.Andrew created the silk trap which was his idea as a design of a trap and hey it's sorta smart.Andrew found out that problem in ""Oscorp"" that got the 3 legged mice to grow back their feet even though it was nerdy as well.My point is Andrew did better.Andrew did better as Spider-Man: He has Web-Shooters.Spider-Man actually messed around in the movie like he's supposed to and Spider-Man was also way more agile and powerful on this one.This is proof since in the movie Peter Parker found out that Dr.Connors(The Lizard),was going to turn everyone into over-mutated- lizards,so Peter put on his Spider-Man suit and went to swing into action.Yet,he got shot but re-fought and it let into him swinging in the scene ""The Crane Swing"" where Spider-Man shows his great agility in swinging.Results: Real Spider-Man fans look at small details which leads to The Amazing Spider-Man being better but only the characters and acting were completed right in Amazing Spider-Man and also the beginning,but The Spider-Man also did awesome in plot,so I don't think one goes to choose but appreciate what was done.Other:In my personal opinion,Amazing Spider-Man had the characters cast perfectly and the story started of the way it's supposed to.If you are a huge Spider-Man fan.Watch this great movie now.I also like The Amazing Spider-Man suit better.This movie deserves 10.‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•/‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•(10/10)","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","cthirlby","12 December 2021","This movie is both gritty, fun and emotional.Uncle Ben in the film was great and matches the energy as the original as he is so lovable and it's heartbreaking to watch him die and Peter listening to his voice message. The Lizard was an interesting villain he felt like both Doc Ock and Green Goblin as he went insane and thought he turned himself into a monster by the end. Gwen Stacy is the best Spider-Man live action love interest so far, she is played by an amazing actress and she isn't just Peters girl in this movie she actually does stuff and is a perfect match for Peter as she has a love for science. The swinging scenes by far are the best out of all the films as they are very cinematic and the film has some amazing shots too. Whilst it isn't as deep as the originals it brings something new to the table and just has fun with it. The movie is gritty and Peter is like a ""rebel teen"" of sorts and so it's a different version of Spider-Man that's cool to see and makes the character more gritty and emotional in that way. This is my second favourite live action Spider-Man actor not only cause I love this movie but Andrew loves the character so much.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","namashi_1","29 June 2012","'The Amazing Spider Man' lacks the excitement in comparison to the legendary the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. But if you look at it as a new story all together, it offers some interesting moments. But, for me, this film works primarily for one reason: Andrew Garfield's Winning Performance as Peter Parker / Spider-Man! 'The Amazing Spider-Man' Synopsis: Peter Parker finds a clue that might help him understand why his parents disappeared when he was young. His path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner.'The Amazing Spider Man' is fabulously shot & grandly made. But, I personally felt, that, the Screenplay wasn't up-to the mark. To give its due rightfully, there are some very interesting sequences & the action set-pieces are excellent, but overall, the desired impact, seems a bit missing. Screenplay by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent & Steve Kloves has merits, but it could've been stronger nonetheless. Marc Webb's Direction is stylish. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is vast. Graphics are outstanding. Action set-pieces, as mentioned, are excellent.Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield is up for top honors. The actor is fantastic as Peter Parker / Spider-Man! Its a performance that deserves immense praise. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, does a good job. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard, plays the menace easily. Martin Sheen as Ben Parker & Sally Field as May Parker are impressive, as always. Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy, is in command after a long time. Irrfan Khan as Dr. Rajit Ratha, deserved more footage. On the whole, 'The Amazing Spider Man' isn't Amazing, but stunning to look at nevertheless.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","sule-aniket","30 June 2012","It has been 24 hrs (app.) since i have seen the movie and i am still desperately trying to understand what was the target market in the mind of the director ? The movie was too complicated for children and was strange for adults like me.Despite of Emma stone and Sally field being totally wasted in their respective roles. I still thought that Andrew garfield would do a good job in the movie or at least justice to the spider-man character but he too seemed lost in the school (He is only 28years old) Why did peter and gwen need to go to a school school which occupies half of Manhattan ? as if that is possible in NY.Dr. Connors seemed deranged more than seeming like a genius. when you see a Marvel movie you expect the villain to display a lot of shades of grey and here we had an antagonist who seemed to be obsessed with improving mankind of all its weakness.our dear Dr. Norman Osborn seemed to be dying in the movie (God save the green goblin, what are we going to do in the sequel if the green goblin is not saved !!!) Irfan khan was visiting from the sets of MIB4 or maybe 5 he seems better suited there and not as a scientist dressed in all black.Peter's parents have a small side track which is left unexplained that it leaves viewers perplexed as to why did we just waste 20 minutes talking about them !!! A dying police chief applauds spider-man for his service to NY and tells him that he is meant for great things but also makes him promise to stay away from his daughter. The man just gave his life for the country but seems to be an overprotective father.I had gone in thinking that i would see a movie as amazing as The Avengers but clearly i was disappointed. Sam Raimi was better and we want him back.","4/10"

Finally, when he does Spidey, it's only at night except for a fight in his high school or in an intelligent mirror effect for his 1st appearance. As peter, he shouts to his uncle, his aunt and the father of his girlfriend! His casting reminds me of Christensen in star wars prequels because this Garfield has the same darkside about him.The rest is also pathetic: The Mays are horrible as well in characters or in casting. Lizard might be okay but his ties with Peter is unbelievable. The Stacys are OK but killing Captain is useless: what's the point to develop a character and a tension if it's not meant to last. And if Emma Stone is a good surprise here, it's just because Dunst was always boring and uninspired. To resume, the first hour dragged horribly, the second makes you angry and it's only the final moment that you will find a decent Spidey but it's not enough and too late. Frankly, the only amazing thing in this movie may be Spidey's web because it's true that the new effects is bluffing.In other words, with Raimi and Maguire movies, i was eager to buy the DVD while i won't even bother to download this one on the web!","1/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","shaikhirshad-41223","13 December 2021","What a cinematography. The vfx editor which edited the film has just nailed it. I thought this movie will be little bit similar to Sam Raimi's Spider-man. But after watching this movie I'm completely stunned. What a direction. The direction was so perfectly done and the cast was fantastic. Specially Andrew & the Lizard. Superbly act and the screenplay of the movie is so fast that it's just changed the whole spider-man movie format like Raimi used to direct. Hatts of to the director and all the cast & crew members. If you are a spidey fan then a must watch....","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","krissaddy","3 July 2012","I had the opportunity of watching this movie on the second day of its release on this Saturday. Nearly 4 days before the actual US release.Firstly lets leave the whole, ""Oh! its a reboot and not a sequel"" thing outside the door. Its something the industrial analysts must be bothered about. As an audience it does not matter to me. I just want a movie to be entertaining and this movie is really better than the first Spiderman movie. This movie is getting unfair treatment as its a reboot. This movie should be judged by its own merit and not by comparisons. I consider myself blessed and entertained.... This may not be one of the jump-the-gun fast paced superhero flicks, it takes it time to establish the characters. Even the character development is done is a beautiful and entertaining way. I though this was much needed as people were already used to Spider man story and the mentality needed to change and realize that ""Its not the same deal anymore"". That was necessary and it was done perfectly. If you have seen 500 Days of Summer, you know that Marc Webb is good at directing romantic scenes, he has used this skill to his advantage and he has done a great job of showing the romance between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker... When it comes to performances, Andrew Garfield gets full points for being the best spider man in town... Not only does he look like spider man from the comics, his character was bratty and more vibrant than the ""Toby Maguire spidy"" which I really liked. Andrew is a good actor. I have always liked him since I first saw Boy A, thankfully he didn't fade into the void, Emma Watson playing Gwen Stacy the love interest of Spiderman really hit the bulls-eye. She looks gorgeous and lovable and she fits the role like a glove. The chemistry between the two is one of the high points of the movie... They look amazing together. Its a pity that Uncle Ben had to die in this movie, Martin Sheen fit the bill. The others did their job well. Its a better acted movie than all the first three Spidy movies. The second half of the movie is action packed with some tangible human spirit imbibed into it. There is one particular scene towards the end when Spidy is gravely hurt and the whole city comes to his rescue. It reminded me of brilliant ""train scene"" in Spider man 2, which is also my top spidy moment ever. Lizard as the villain was not as menacing as the previous bad guys in the Spider man Series, but a lot of the story is open for continuity and more villains are sure to follow. Also Lizard was not actually supposed to be menacing as he is still a good man gone bad due to a lab experiment gone wrong. Finally I would have to point out that this movie is made in 3D and they took advantage of our Superhero's maneuverability to a great extent. Some of the first person shots are breathtaking and feels like you are there with Spidy all the way. I would say this is my second favorite Spider man Movie after Spider Man 2. Its a slow movie no doubt but establishes the characters properly once it gets going it gets more entertaining. I am more than sure that the sequel will ""Go for it!"" from the start. A must watch movie for all Spider man fans. Truly ""Amazing""! Marc Webb Good job!","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","sanddragon939","29 June 2012","A decade ago, Tobey Maguire brought everyone's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man to the big screen in Sam Raimi's blockbuster film, that spawned two sequels and won a legion of loyal fans across the globe...including me! For it was Raimi's 'Spider-Man' that first introduced me to Peter Parker and his world, and for that I will always be grateful to the film...but, there's simply no denying the fact that Marc Webb's 'The Amazing Spider-Man' has FAR surpassed the webhead's original cinematic incarnation!I think the best comparison one can offer for this film is Christopher Nolan's now-legendary Batman reboot, 'Batman Begins'. Much like how 'Begins' reinvented the Dark Knight for a new generation by focusing on a more grounded, character-driven arc for Bruce Wayne...'Amazing Spider- Man' does the same for Peter Parker. This is a Spider-Man one almost feels CAN exist in the real world...a Peter Parker who, while technically still a 'nerd', is no milksop and far from a goody-two- shoes.Andrew Garfield unquestionably deserves the bulk of the credit for the success of this film. He highlights the duality of Peter Parker and Spider-Man as Maguire never did-'Spider-Man' is not just Peter in a mask...Spider-Man is Peter freed from all the restraints of his identity, all the consequences of his actions. The mask of Spider-Man, to Peter, represents the anonymity similarly offered by Internet chat- rooms and forums; a point Garfield has raised in interviews, and which is is reflected throughout the film. His Peter doesn't become a superhero overnight...rather, his is a journey that encompasses the whole narrative of the film until, by the end, we finally see him become the heroic legend we all know and love. Perhaps the most striking difference, at least on a superficial level, between Garfield's Spider- Man and his predecessor, is the fact that this is a Spidey who's liberal with the wise-cracks. He is a hormonal, sometimes annoying, 17 year old and he sure acts like one!Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans deliver solid performances as Gwen Stacy and Dr. Curt Connors respectively. Stone's Gwen Stacy is certainly superior to Kirsten Dundt's Mary Jane Watson from the previous series-she's not just a love interest, but an integral part of the plot, along with her father, Captain George Stacy (Dennis Leary). Ifans plays Connors as a well-intentioned visionary gone astray, literally, as the reptilian monster known as the 'Lizard'...a powerful performance that easily rivals those of William Dafoe as Green Goblin or Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus from the old series.Beyond the excellent portrayals though, the movie's true strength is derived from an excellent script and some brilliant direction on the part of Marc Webb. While quiet a few liberties have been taken with the source material, Webb manages to stay pretty close to the spirit of Stan Lee's original story. The 'Ultimate Spider-Man' series has also clearly been a major influence, both stylistically and conceptually. While the film is a complete story in itself, there are a few plot threads left hanging...mysteries waiting to be resolved in the inevitable future installments. For now though, Spidey fans all over the world can enjoy this wonderful love-letter to Stan Lee and Steve Dikto's 50 year old creation!","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","escalad89","1 November 2012","This movie in my personal opinion was the best Spiderman film of the 4! This movie came the closest to the comic that any of the other three!!! This movie developed the relationship between Gwen and Peter and sadly left Mary Jane out of it!This movie was funnier better written and better actors than the first 3! Why they choose The Lizard for the villain is beyond me! That was the worst park of the movie!The nest logical choice for the villain is: The Jackel, obsessed with Gwen, for the 2nd film. The Green Goblin, throws Gwen off a bridge, for the 3rd film. That way the can develop the romance between Mary Jane and Peter Parker in the 4th film, if this film franchise reaches that far.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","samuellop10","27 July 2012","First, the thing that most impressed me about The Amazing Spider-man was its storytelling. If you think about it, it is actually pretty simple, but I thought that it was very effective nonetheless. The characters and sequence of events including the action sequences as well as emotional ones were what made up most of it. Second, the characters had more than enough depth and most of them were not your typical stereotypes. Andrew Garfield made for one interesting Peter Parker/Spider-man. He was great at bringing him out. He made for one weird Spider-man which was something refreshing. Awkward all around, yet decisive, agile, and funny. Unknowingly helping the villain, then obtaining his powers, and a little time later trying to stop him; all the while experiencing and dealing with human emotions. From the comments I have read, this is the Spider-man from the comic books. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was refreshing to see as well. I liked that this time around the love interest got more involved in helping the hero stop the villain. It made the story more layered and interesting. She was appealing and charming. The chemistry between them, by the way, was great. Probably the best chemistry I have seen between a hero and his love interest. Dr. Connors made for a great villain. Evil, but at the same time being able to show and keep his human side. The rest of the actors, Denis Leary as Captain Stacy, Sally Field as aunt May, and Martin Sheen as uncle Ben did awesome jobs as well. Even though they did not get as much screen time, they were great supporting actors who made the film more interesting and entertaining. Third, if you were expecting for the film to surpass the previous one, you will most-likely, at least, be satisfied. Like 99.9% most-likely. The Spider-man character was different, but without a doubt better. The love interest, Gwen Stacy this time, was definitely better also. In one phrase, she totally kicks MJ's butt, at least in the movies. I would not know about it in the comic books. The villain, Dr. Connors a.k.a. The Lizard, did not surpass the Green Goblin in his evilness, but it made for a more complicated and exciting plot and challenge for Spider-man. Other things like the visuals, directing, and special effects, especially thanks to the 3D, were better as well this time around. Story-wise, this time it was more complicated and layered, but executed with simplicity, which only helped the film in making it more engaging and entertaining. So years ago when Peter Parker was only a child, his parents went away and left him in the care of his aunt May and uncle Ben. A briefcase which Peter's dad left behind is discovered. It includes sensitive information about a biological project involving splicing reptile DNA and its properties with human one, which works to regenerate the human body; Dr. Connors is mentioned within it. Later Peter discovers that Gwen is working with Dr. Connors in his lab, and he also finds out that Dr. Connors is still trying to solve part of the project to finalize it. Then Peter sees that the solution is among the papers in the briefcase, and he shares the solution with Dr. Connors. Unfortunately Dr. Connors uses it on himself without enough research and trails, bringing side effects to himself such as super-strength, physical deformation, and a distorted state of mind. It is a temporal thing, working only as long as the regenerative effects last, but, after experiencing the strength and its power, he can not let it go, and convinces himself that this this is the perfect state for humans. So he starts this by trying to make all of the city like him. After Peter sees him and what he is capable of, he takes responsibility of it, thinking that he should because he helped to solve the project, and thus helped turn Dr. Connors into The Lizard. During the same time Gwen and Peter become closer, more than just friends. And she also becomes closely involved in trying to stop The Lizard from transforming all of the city. While this is happening Peter has also to deal trying to hide his secret from his aunt and uncle, and escaping from the police who have branded him a criminal, especially Gwen's dad, Captain Stacy. The film seemed a little slow at times, and when it was done it felt like a short movie, which is totally inaccurate as the film runs a little over two hours. For me this just means that the film was so good it kept me engaged all throughout it, so I did not think about the time. If you analyze it, It might not be the most packed and intense action superhero movie out there, however, not having the most intense in those things does not necessarily make it boring or bad. When there is no action to make it intense, the film is still very entertaining and interesting. Plus, for me characters and story lines are more important. The reason is that when there is no intense action on screen is when the story and characters develop. So when the action does happen it is made more intense not because it is actually intense, but because you are more engrossed in the story and because you care more about the characters due to those times in the film when there is no action. And this is exactly what The Amazing Spider- man does.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","pvdimitriy","20 January 2022","The famous reboot of the franchise left few people satisfied at first. A new actor, a new costume - everything is new, and after Toby Maugaier, beloved by many
However, as time went on, the film was viewed and the impression became better. Much better, which left fans in two camps: those who embraced the change, the freshness of the franchise, and those who never strayed from Sam Raimi's cinematic Spider-Man canon.But only one thing can be said with certainty: the magical chemistry of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, Spiderman, which really corresponds to the canons - this gives the films a well-deserved positive assessment.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Xandercell","13 June 2013","Here are my quick thoughts, I had my reservations and kept my expectations in check going into this film and didn't know what to expect but thankfully Marc Webb managed to do a fantastic job despite the fact that he did hit a lot of the same elements from Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-man, nonetheless this is a promising start to a new trilogy.Andrew Garfield hits it out of the park with his performance as Peter Parker and Emma Stone is Wonderful as Gwen Stacey their chemistry is obvious from the start. The inclusion of Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard was long overdue and was played adequately by Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen and Sally Field were great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May as was Dennis Leary's Captain Stacy.In short, a solid cast, great story and wonderful effects inject new blood into an already great blockbuster franchise.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","anna01010","3 June 2022","I hadn't seen this iteration of Spiderman before, but after watching this movie, I don't feel like I missed much. I just couldn't get past the casting. Andrew Garfield looks every bit of 30 in this role. I know we have to suspend logic to get into the fantasy, but come on, give us a little help, yeah? There really wasn't anything memorable or outstanding about this film. It's just something to do when you're really bored, I think.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","RatchetJak94","13 July 2012","Spider-Man is my favorite super-hero of all time. I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).I enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.I don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.Let's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a ""Jekyll and Hyde""-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.The visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.The musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.If I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel.","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","legioner8800","4 July 2012","Probably it's because I've seen the Tobey-Man and this is the reason I give this movie such a low score. I wanted to learn more about Peter's parents, but did not. ""They were scientists."" So what? That's not even 5% of what I needed to find out. Tobey-Man was on par with emotions, stunts and discovering the character. Here your uncle dies and what you see is 2 mins of drama about him. They really did not expand the characters and that led to my disappointment. This really isn't the spider-man I wanted to see (full of questioning, thoughts and hardship). This guy was crying one minute and kissing the girl in another. Did I even mention that the suit did not fully fit him? Did I mention that Peter became a super scientists in 5 mins after he start reading 2 books and a couple of documents that do not make sense? Since when kids study genetics in school so deeply? Tobey-Man's story deeper and more interesting. You could see the bright side of having super powers and the dark of constantly having the responsibility to hide your identity and take care of the closest. The new Spidey did little effort to hide his id. I could actually say that he was waving his mask the entire movie...If you were happy with Tobey-man, stick with him!","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","kxsinc","17 December 2021","So when I watched this movie for the first time (way after it had come out), I was under the impression that it was a pretty forgettable movie by the Marvel fandom and I just needed to watch it so I could understand what would happen in No Way Home. So I have it watch.Honestly, it was better than what I thought it was, but definitely one of the weaker Spider-Man movies. There are things that don't work in this movie - personally, Peter Parker as a skate kid didn't do it for me, a couple unsolved plots, and Uncle Ben (where was the famous line??) but there were good things tooThe action and design of this movie was phenomenal. The swinging action is still the only movie that fully captures the agility of Spider-Man (the newer MCU ones don't really have these action shots) and the fight scenes are so cleverly made. Andrew Garfield got the Spider-Man half right - he captured the clever and witty personality of Spider-Man better than Maguire did. The second thing, really what stood out about this movie is the chemistry between Gwen and Parker. Something about their relationship connected and really made me think they were destined to be together. It's better than any other marvel ship that comes to my mind and thus just made the ending so satisfying for me.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","AntonyZ-UC","16 January 2022","The Amazing Spider Man is an example of how to use CGI, its just beautiful, the lighting, the models, everything. For me the best thing of this movie is the love between Gwen and Peter, Marc Webb does that perfectly, I think the storyline is good too, the first act was a good origin, don't get me wrong, it just dont have the sparkle the first one had, I love the homemade suit of this movie. My favorite thing of the movie was the end, the death of Gwen's father broke me, he saying to Peter to not put Gwen into this, the funeral. I love the mensage of this movie, not everything can be the way we want, this movie is almost perfect, and it's not even close to be bad.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","corneliussenespen","19 October 2012","Having realized I'm a sucker for all these comic book adaptations, of course I had to see this one as well. I never did like the earlier Spiderman movies, being the main role or the supporting ones, I'm not sure; but they still stand among the movies I'm not eager to watch again. But this one, on the contrary, was actually quite entertaining. Not was it only packed with really great CGI, but it had a great flow built up on both action, drama, romance and humor.At least for me this is what makes a good movie. I never once thought ""Oh, my goodness that was lame"" (which I often actually do), instead I was rather surprised I was laughing out loud in more than one of the scenes.All the actors did a MARVELous job, meaning all the jokes, the depth of the drama, and the sincerity of both the romance and the action stood solid throughout the movie. Speaking of the actors: the casting was brilliant. All of the main actors (and I guess most of the supporting ones) was perfect for their roles, and must have made the script it self proud.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","camcrafton","15 December 2012","""Spoiler Warning Just to be Safe!!!"" I liked the original three Spiderman films as much as anybody, if not more, but I really feel like they did an amazing job with this reboot. I may be in the minority, but I feel like this film did a great job at handling Peter's change from nerd to hero. Every character in this film felt human, and every actor did a fantastic job with their respective characters. A lot people keep comparing this to the original three films, and even more are saying that they should of just made a fourth film instead of reboot...I disagree. This film didn't reinvent the story, nor did it switch it up much but what it did do was make the characters more relatable and made this A lot closer to the comics, although it still isn't exactly like the comics. One of my main gripes about the original Spiderman film was a petty one, I'll admit that, but it got addressed and was fixed in this one. That would be the fact the Parker actually has to make his web shooters in this one whereas in the original the spider bite gave him his power to shoot webs. Now for the villain...while The Lizard obviously has nothing on The Green Goblin, I feel like he was a great choice for the film. While, yes Goblin is iconic, I feel that he should be the main focus in the movie he appears and not given a side role for over half the movie which they would of had to do in an origin story such as this one. A lot of people were upset about the CGI limiting The Lizar's movement,and I can honestly say it didn't bother me one bit. In fact I would prefer the CGI over some guy running around in a lizard costume...that wouldn't be very menacing now would it? In conclusion, I feel like this reboot was justified and in my humble and honest opinion proved to be BETTER than any of the original three Spiderman films, except for possibly the second one... Cannot wait for TSM2 to come out!","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","supernatural136-112-438827","5 July 2012","I loved this movie. I know most of the reviews you're going to see will rebuke it just for being a reboot, no the original, but I have to say that I actually liked The Amazing Spiderman much better than the original. First with the cast. I love, love, loved Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker. As a regular high school nerd talking with his crush, he managed to make the audience awkward for him, and thats something never explored by the first Spiderman. Overall, this movie was a much more accurate portrayal of what would happen if a teenage boy suddenly became a superhero. Emma Stone also impressed everyone as Spidey's new love interest Gwen Stacy, and she's a very much welcome replacement of Mary Jane Watson. The entire trilogy of Spiderman, and I think all Mary Jane did was scream and put on her best ""ahhhh, I'm captured"" face. Gwen Stacy is half the reason Spiderman triumphs in this movie, and wasn't once used as bait. Secondly, the special effects. There's these two scenes, made even more amazing by the 3D, where the audience is actually seeing through Spiderman's eyes as he flies over the city. It's absolutely breathtaking. Most of the web-slinging scenes are beautifully made, but the other reviews are right when they say the action is not what it could have been. the Amazing Spiderman focused more on the characters than the original. It's more about why they do what they do and how they feel about it, not just about how they beat the bad guy. In summary, I loved the reboot of the Spiderman franchise and can't wait for the next one. I give it a nine out of ten.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","gmfx82","18 November 2012","I'm not a huge fan of the Spiderman films and I had heard little or nothing in regards to this one from friends and colleagues alike.However the movie was I think better made than the previous versions of the character. Purists will find holes in some of the explanations of the character and his abilities if they compare it to the other movies, but better to take this movie on it's own merits rather than comparisons.I found the acting was very good from all the players and the filming had a very classy feel to it, the effects were enjoyable and not over the top. Above all there was a good sprinkling of humour from the character punctuated with good timing throughout the movie.Andrew Garfield played the part very well and surprised me with his clear acting abilities,Denis Leary is as good as always.It felt like money well spent picking this one up!","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","craigfil","8 July 2012","I will keep this short but after seeing all the other reviews I am very surprised at the negativity and tbh I think it is the usual resistance to change in a lot of cases.As a spider-man film, and as a Marvel/DC fan of over 30 years, I loved it. My 9 year old also came out thinking this is the best spider-man film yet, trumping the Sam Raimi ones, which while excellent didn't have the same amount of 'soul' for me. My best friend and his wife didn't want to watch this due to the negativity surrounding it, which is a real shame as I think they have missed out on a real gem. A 9 from me, the average of mine and my son's rating. :)P.S. I watched this in 2D as I find the vast majority of 3D films get in the way of the movie experience, Hugo being the notable exception.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","jaredclontz","28 July 2013","I really enjoyed this movie. It brings new life to the franchise of THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. It goes in great depth of how Peter Parker turns into SPIDERMAN. I mean it wasn't fake looking, like the high school looked as if it were real because in some movies you say that is nothing like how high school is like but it was portrayed very well. Then when he was making his web shooters you just saw all these blue prints and you saw him make. You can tell that this SPIDERMAN is closer to the one in the comics. Although the suit wasn't the same you can role with it. But the plot was well written and for once the girl friend was never kept hostage. The acting was really good Andrew Garfield is (29 or 30) Emma Stone is (24 or 25) in real life in there acting made you believe they were actually 17. There's a lot of kissing scenes but you know what who cares that is what makes you believe there young. The LIZARD was well done and everything made you think that this really could happen (cross genetics.) Screw the critics this is an awesome movie and if your a Spidey fan you will love it. P.S. They have really good songs chose too.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","laurenlchilcott","9 July 2013","A 2012 reboot of the original Sam Raimi spider man movies that I think is miles better. Andrew Garfield makes a better peter parker/spider man in my opinion he looked the part, had the right personality and acted it out perfectly where as Tobey Maguire I thought was too geeky and shy with not much personality.unlike the original this movie stays completely true to the comic, his first love is Gwen Stacy played by the amazing Emma stone who is fantastic as always but in the original they had Mary Jane which is wrong because peter didn't meet Mary Jane until after, when peter starts turning into spider man he makes a web shooter out of cartridges but the original just had it coming out his wrists and the villain was the same in the comic being the lizard played by Rhys Ifans who did a fantastic job he played both personalities of good and bad superbly compared to the ridiculous green goblin who was just awful. all the CGI and effects in this movie are faultless and top notch, they took total advantage of all the technology we have in this day and age and the whole movie was so well made and looked stunning, the design of spider mans costume was great, the camera work on the swinging through the city shots were superb and the lizard was scarily life like the whole entire movie makes the original look lame and outdated completely.in conclusion only bother with the amazing spider man not the originals and look forward to the sequel in 2014.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","robzilla915","15 July 2013","Okay, I had high expectations for this movie, and let me say that it exceeded those expectations. The story is perfectly done, the cast played there parts very well (especially Garfield and Stone ), the action was very well done and the score is absolutely astonishing. Seeing this made me excited for the sequels coming in the future. I can tell that the ""Amazing Spiderman"" movies will continue to get better and better. I am loving the different take on Spiderman. Andrew Garfield is the perfect choice for Spiderman. Now don't get me wrong, Tobey Maguire was a good Spiderman, but there was several things wrong with him. 1. Was his size. He was just too buff to be Spiderman. I know this is a stupid reason, but it's a reason none the less. 2. His tone was too monotone at most points. Those are just a few. Garfield embodied all that was needed to be Spiderman. Now, as everyone should have been able to tell, the cast had incredible chemistry with each other. Not saying the cast of Raimi's trilogy didn't have chemistry with each other, but the cast in this movie just worked and flowed with each other. That is one of the key things in making a movie.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Empifilmes","1 January 2022","What a movie!The best Spiderman of all time
From the incredible performance of Andrew Garfield to the film's deep and mature story, the film manages to address the same themes as the original (2002) but in a more adult and realistic way. In this movie, unlike the original, we can understand the pain of Peter Parker, and why he is Spider-Man, because he gives hope to others, and who gives hope to him is Gwen. Perfect writing.Apart from this the Movie has very few ""Plotholes"" and pays attention to various details.The villain isn't amazing, but his motivation is valid and what he says makes sense

"The Amazing Spider-Man","doctoreew","29 December 2021","Most of you will disagree with me on this one, but I believe Andrew's spiderman is the best spiderman the silver screen has seen. After the release of NWH, I decided to take an adventure to this universe. Come to find out, I don't agree with any hate for these movies. The writing, although scratchy in some places, is fixed by the skilled performance of Andrew Garfield. Tom Holland comes across as a team player, Toby, although spectacular, doesn't quite match the teenage notion of how spiderman is portrayed. Garfield has a much more childish view of life, and consequences of his decisions. His Peter Parker is moody, as a normal teen is. His spiderman is carefree, but he learns from his mistakes. This is why I believe he is the best spiderman that has ever existed. Although most don't, I'm routing for you Andrew. You are amazing.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","ford_guy20042000","3 July 2012","There is no comparison really.This movie when compared to the previous Spiderman movies far outshines the old Tobey Maquire movies.Where to begin.The acting...they used real actors. When Spidey gets the crap kicked out of him, you feel it. You see blood, you see wounds and bruises. Not the kind that Tobey got where 2 seconds later he was all better. It felt more real. Andrew Garfield is a Superior actor over Tobey. Sally Field, Martin Sheen, and Emma Stone completely surpassed their previous incarnations, however I felt that the Aunt May character and Gwen Stacy character were a bit underused.The truly wonderful thing about the movie is, the lame humor of the past is gone. There isn't a Russian landlord chasing Peter for rent. And Peter doesn't feel like a whiny, little girl like Tobey portrayed him. For instance in those movies, in all three he screamed like a girl when hit.The story was solid, but not strong. They had it in the right direction, but I think they needed to build on a few things. I didn't buy the main plot of the Lizard. OK..whatever but I was thinking...really? The story was still good enough to be called good and by far the best of the Spidey movies.Fight scenes, Spidey web slinging through the air, and the CGI all great. No complaints there.The chemistry between Peter and Gwen, they have what Tobey and Kirsten Dunst did not have. They need to seriously expand on that in the next movie. The man is what drives the hero. They need to get the balance right, and they need to develop his relationships a bit more.One of my main gripes of the old movies was that in every one of them the other characters insisted on calling Peter by both his first and last name, all the time. Peter Parker this and Peter Parker that. It was ridiculous and nobody talks like that. Sadly they did carry that into this movie as well. Although without quite the hokiness of the others.They need to keep a sense of realism. Don't get silly with it. Make dreams come true and not just transfer the dream to screen. I want to believe that its possible that a man with spider powers can fight a giant lizard man on a tall skyscraper. Which they did pretty well in this one.It is absolutely and completely worth your time to go see.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","DICK STEEL","29 June 2012","I would never have thought Garfield as the right person for the job. But I'm glad that he had proved me wrong, just as how Marc Webb had unequivocally stated that we haven't seen nothing yet with what Garfield can do with the role. He morphed into Peter Parker the shy lad, like hand in glove, and then transformed into the heroic Spider-Man sans mask, straddling and struggling with his dual identities just as how any scrawny teenager would if to be blessed (or cursed) with new found abilities, highlighting awkwardness and the building of confidence to perfection. Webb knew exactly what he was looking for in a leading man and allowed plenty of emotional engagement and attachment to Garfield's Peter, with Garfield proving him right, and now carries the superhero mantle with aplomb, nailing it as an unlikely hero.Then there's Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, equally important as the romantic fodder for Peter Parker, and this update had given us a leading lady character who has beauty and brains combined, together with a degree of spunk that Mary Jane Watson in the previous three films had lacked, with the latter falling prey in each and every installment that it was getting pretty tired. Stone has proved to carry an entire film on her own, and here shares incredible chemistry opposite Garfield to make them that cute couple in school who have to battle the pangs of first love, and not only having to deal with that strong emotion, but loss as well. While that Maguire-Dunst upside down tongue gymnastics is something hard to beat, Garfield-Stone do have their little romantic stunt that adds a degree of fun that each of Raimi's version lacked. Which is a good thing especially when trying to sway over the nay- sayers.I suppose almost everyone out there will know what to expect already from an origin movie, and James Vanderbilt's story kicks off into high gear from the get go, weaving and setting a new stage and universe in which this version of Spider-Man will thrive under, with Oscorp being that scientific conglomerate headed by an unseen, but constantly mentioned Norman Osborn, and having the mythos deeply involving the corporation, opening doors to possibilities that any subsequent film can cover, especially with that end credits scene. It also picked up from the Batman Begins template in a number of areas, but I'm not complaining because it's all good to successfully reboot the franchise, adapting elements from its comic book source which serve as canon, but giving it a different angle that maintains the spirit of things and events, even key ones like Uncle Ben's demise that truly shaped the destiny of the wall-crawler.As always with the Spider-Man mythos, Peter Parker deals more with loss, and loses more than he's won, and having that retained in the film made it venture down a darker road, and being more vulnerable. And going back to basics never hurt, with one single villain in Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) as the Lizard, even if an army of Lizards were hinted at from merchandise, and keeping/hinting at others who may appear in subsequent movies. The villain-hero set up was reminiscent of the second Raimi film with Peter Parker and Dr Octopus sharing a connection before the latter went bonkers, and provided yet again another battle on the emotional front. The Lizard may be lesser known, but is a powerful foe that audiences may have already been primed for from Raimi's films if they were to do a little research on the recurring Connors character then.Action wise, Webb had gotten excellent material from the comics and clearly dipped into them for inspiration, with Spidey's iconic poses and movement all making it into the film, coming off as poetry in motion. This was something that the earlier Spider-Man films had paled in comparison, with action sequences all being more kinetic in treatment, utilizing a whole slew of Spider-abilities. And the mechanical web shooters weren't all that bad, since again it went back to basics to showcase Parker's intellect, if only for a short while during a montage as does showing off his sewing skills. Webbing plays a big role in being the arsenal of choice, and the variation shown in this film is staggering, with the previous films never even coming close to how this Spider-Man excelled in fighting with them. And with those webshooters, you'll be itching for moments when the web fluid would run out, or to have something happen to them like how the Stan Lee (probably the best cameo appearances of all Marvel films here) devised in his stories, just to provide additional challenge.Marc Webb had shown not only Sam Raimi can make a good Spider-Man summer blockbuster, and I'm pretty sure Webb's version can stand up to and probably excel from the predecessors.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","davidisgoliath38","30 March 2014","Toby Magure was never believable as Spiderman, I mean Stan Lee's Spiderman. He wasn't enough of a smart ass. He was hard to take seriously, he lacked the ability to make his character believable, because maybe he thought the whole superhero/spiderman thing was corny. Andrew Garfield grew up reading the comics, and that comes through. This is not just a rehashing, it's treating Stan Lee's characters and story with the respect they deserve. People really thought Spiderman 3 did Gwen Stacy justice? In Stan Lee's Spiderman Gwen Stacy is his first love, and she's a sweet girl (pretty much what the first three films did with Mary Jane). In the comics Mary Jane is a fiery redhead who's not anything like the Mary Jane in the first 3 spiderman movies. In fact it would make sense for MaryJane not to appear at all in the first 2 or 3 movies. This movie really does a great job of playing out these characters the way they should be played out. I wasn't a fan of the darker look from the trailers but I got over it. Spiderman isn't the avengers, and if you think about all of the arcs in the Spiderman comics you realize that his life is just filled with tragic irony and bittersweet moments. For that reason the dark direction actually makes sense. People saying this isn't as good as the first 3, maybe you haven't watched them in a while. I remember being blown away by Spiderman and Spiderman 2 as a kid. But comic movies have gotten a lot better since then. You've had incredible ones like the Dark Knight and Iron Man and the Avengers. The first three Spiderman movies are over the top with the cheesiness to a degree that should make real Spiderman fans cringe. They made green goblin just the first villain instead of the mastermind behind the rising if other villains. You shouldn't fight the big boss in the first level. Gwen Stacy was an afterthought in the third movie, when Stan Lee has said that Gwen Stacy was supposed to be Spider-man's true love. To sum it up, Amazing Spiderman is a LOT better than those terrible first 3 films, and people who aren't able to see that are blinded by nostalgia.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","notstone","8 August 2012","I'll keep it simple. I loved this movie. Spiderman has been my favorite super hero since around 1983 when I got my first Spiderman action figure. This is the Spiderman movie I have been waiting for. Fine, it's a reboot, and everybody wants to compare it to the first series, but I don't care. I felt that the movie had just enough humor, cheese, drama and teenage angst and awkwardness. I liked that Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy actually had some chemistry. P.P. felt more believable as a teenager than in the first serious...and I dig that he made his own webbing rather than it just spitting out of his wrist. The spidey suit was way cooler in this flick than the first series. It didn't look CGI throughout the whole movie like the originals. It's actually a dude in a suit. When he takes out his cell phone to talk to whoever, that's pretty hilarious. It's got action, fun, adventure, a coming of age aspect, drama and cheese. It makes for a good film.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","alindsayal","23 December 2021","Next on my Spider-Man review series is the reboot The Amazing Spider-Man and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Peter Parker become Spider-Man and have to stop a new mentor from changing New York forever.Main Character
Andrew Garfield plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he is very good in his role. His Peter Parker is really different to Tobey Maguire's and it does seem like this interpretation of the character has been more modernised and it works pretty well. He is really great as Spider-Man, he nails the quips well and I think overall this is a different but effective showing by Garfield.Supporting Characters
Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy and she is really good, she is a fun love interest that doesn't ever annoy me. The chemistry is amazing on screen which is probably helped by some off screen chemistry, it really raises the quality of the film and it makes the whole romance angle of the film an actual joy to watch. Rhys Ifans plays Curt Connors/The Lizard and he is also decent, I have some complaints about the character but his performance is pretty strong and if given more attention this could have been a top villain instead of just a decent one. The late Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, Dennis Law and Sally Field are also all good in their roles and fit the world very well around the other three more prominent characters.Story
The story is good in terms of introducing us to a new Spider-Man and it does certain elements that are new and fresh in this world. I just wish it had leaned into these more focused instead of things that are quite generic or that we have seen before. This is a clear origin film and it just feels really rehashed, maybe something else could have been done to change it up or just have him be Spider-Man at the start of the film. Also Lizard's plan is just absurd and makes no sense, it feels underdeveloped and rushed just because the film needs a villain.Script
The script has some good one liners from Spider-Man, he feels funny and like you would imagine a young man as a new super hero would. But the drama is a bit of a mixed bag, the romance is good and I cared about it, but some of the other drama doesn't work. It feels like it isn't fleshed out enough and doesn't do enough to really make me care.Style
The film looks really good, Spider-Man's costume and swinging look fantastic and I really liked how it did the POV shots of him swinging as it felt like we were swinging with him in the rooftops of New York. But some of the action scenes didn't really hit with me and I wasn't a huge fan of Lizard's look in the film. The pacing isn't great either with the first act in particular dragging for me.Overall
Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man is a good film. If you are a fan of the character you will enjoy it but it could have maybe done a bit more to stand out.Rating - 7/10.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","lethelweapon","12 April 2013","I know people spidey fans will disagree with what I am about to say but i think that the original spider man trilogy is like avatar in the sense that they are good movies but are completely over rated. they don't have anything on other superhero films such as say The Dark Knight trilogy, The reason why I preferred the new one was because it was less corny and more satisfying than the originals. The only part I was disappointed with was the fact that peter parkers school bully became his friend at the end, because I was glad to see how they made peters bully was sorry for beating him up when it came to a life and death matter but when he became his friend it was taken to far and felt to corny. other than that it was defiantly worth seeing.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","MBunge","10 July 2012","To preface this review, I thought Sam Raimi's Spider-Man was a really entertaining film that managed to overcome some pretty big mistakes. Spider-Man II is one of the best super-hero movies ever. Spider-Man III was a mess that still had a few redeeming features. The Amazing Spider-Man? Well, it was fun with some really strong elements and there was nothing as garishly wrong with it as the Green Goblin's costume and Macy Gray's appearance in Spider-Man or Topher Grace's botched Venom in Spider-Man III. As someone who grew up reading the comics, I'll credit director Mark Webb with getting right a lot of the little things Raimi did not. But while I think this is ultimately a good flick and worth seeing, it's also one of the most fundamentally problematic movies I've ever watched.To start with, this is a retelling of Spider-Man's origin, something we saw only a decade previously with Raimi. As much as they change the details (and we'll get into that in a second) and give this story a very different tone, however, it's telling us stuff with which we're already quite familiar. A good chunk of this film, as nicely done as it is, has an unavoidably superfluous quality. At the more sluggish points of the plot, you can't help but feel like you'd rather be watching Spider-Man IV instead of a reboot of the first movie.Secondly, this thing largely butchers the classic Spider-Man origin. Paradoxically, I suspect most viewers won't mind that much because the more traditional (at least in that respect) Raimi take is fresh in their memories. But if this had been the first Spider-movie ever made, comic book fanboys would be lighting themselves on fire in protest. It's not even about them not saying ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". It's that Peter Parker's lesson in responsibility isn't something he learns from the death of his beloved Uncle Ben. It's something he learns during a dinner table conversation with some guy he's never met before. If that's how it had worked in Amazing Fantasy #15, I'm not sure things would have worked out quite so well for Marvel Comics.Thirdly, while the romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy clicks thanks to the chemistry of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, the relationship itself is kind of a poorly told joke. While Garfield and Stone are frequently great together on screen, the story underneath them is forced and manufactured. Whereas Raimi provided reasons for Peter and Mary Jane Watson to fall in love, this movie throws Peter and Gwen together because that's what the script says. It also helped that the character of Mary Jane had a life independent of Peter Parker in the first two films. Here, Gwen is Peter's inevitable girlfriend/plot device and not much else. And by the end, The Amazing Spider-Man has truly bollixed up the classic Peter/Gwen dynamic from the comics.Boy, it reads like I'm not much of a fan of this motion picture, doesn't it? The truth is, there's many things about it I like immensely. This is the best ever representation of the change in Peter's personality when he puts on the mask and is liberated of his self-imposed awkwardness and insecurity. Spider-Man is finally the wise-cracking motormouth from the comics. And while Tobey McGuire gave Peter Parker a nerdy, dweebish quality, Garfield actually makes him look and sound like a socially inept teenager. Emma Stone is just great and proves a talented comic actress can fill up a shallowly written role. The fight scenes may not be quite on par with the Doc Ock throwdowns from Spider-Man II, but they're damn sweet in their own right. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are also quite good as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, though they have to share the supporting spotlight with Denis Leary as Gwen's police captain father. Rhys Ifans does a fine job a Curt Connors and the mystery subplot of what happened to Peter's parents is well woven throughout the movie. And, of course¬Öweb-shooters, baby!!Let me repeat, The Amazing Spider-Man is a good film and worth watching. It'll certainly get the bad taste out of your mouth from Spider-Man III. It also looks and sounds far more like Nolan's Batman movies than a piece of Marvel cinema, though it does continue the tradition of Spidey's mask coming off at every opportunity. But is it more than just another summer super-hero blockbuster? Not really.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","kaden_lewis","26 December 2021","Before watching Spider-Man No Way Home (2021), I decided to re watch all the previous Spider-Man movies. However, I wanted to review all the Spider-Man movies until after I saw No Way Home so I could get a true rating. Every single Spider-Man movie was amazing, but this one was actually me least favorite. Don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie, it was entertaining, the actors were great and the villain was cool, but it just didn't stick out for me. That is why I feel the others are better.The main thing I really liked about this movie was how it showed the larger backstory or Peter Parker. In the Tobey Maguire films, we were told Peter's parents died, and he had to live with his aunt and uncle. In this movie, we were shown a little bit of what happened to his parents. It also showed them dropping Peter off at uncle Ben and aunt May's house and leaving. I really liked this because it was very unique, interesting, and added a very important aspect of Peter's story that was skipped over in the Sam Raimi movies.Another thing I liked about this moved was the acting and the story. I thought Emma Stone played Gwen Stacy perfectly, and her chemistry with Andrew is unbelievable. Also, the story of this movie was also pretty cool. I liked how Gwen found out Peter was Spider-Man very quickly. I also liked the family aspect added with the Stacy family.As you can see from my review. I really liked this movie. But in my opinion, the other Spider-Man's are just better. Still, I definitely recommend watching this. It is very well done, and important (just like the other movies) if you are going to see No Way Home.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","torchwood949-166-552404","19 June 2012","In 2002 Sam Raimi created the first of his soon to be ""Spider-Man"" trilogy with ""Spider-Man"". Apart from ""X-Men' there hadn't really been a large superhero film since the classic ""Superman"" films from the late 70's, early 80's. 2004 came and Raimi built upon the solid foundations of his initial creation with a near perfect, smart film made for all audiences, even those who had no love for superhero films known as ""Spider-Man 2"". Years later he would go on to make ""Spider-Man 3"", a heavily flawed but still somewhat enjoyable experience. Now 5 years on from the last incarnation of the web slinger we are presented with director Marc Webb's (Who also directed the fantastic ""500 Days of Summer"") perception of the masked crusader in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"".Starting from the ground up we are re-introduced to Spider-Man with a central performance from Andrew Garfield playing Peter Parker, the high school student who receives extraordinary gifts reminiscent of a spider through a bite of a genetically engineered arachnid. Alongside having to understand his newfound powers he gains a love interest with fellow student Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) and discovering the mysterious disappearance of his parents as a child with the help of one-armed scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who worked alongside his dad. However Connors is trying to work on a cure for his arm through the DNA of lizards and ends up becoming a monstrosity known as The Lizard in the process. Now it's up to Spider-Man to prevent The Lizard from tearing apart the city.Marc Webb has taken up this huge task of re-booting the series and has managed to craft a solid piece of summer entertainment, but not without it's flaws. However on the positive side he creates a brilliantly paced blockbuster with the first hour building on the characters and the second hour bringing high-octane action in a constant rhythm without becoming stale. He also manages to capture the character of Spider-Man fantastically bringing the humorous one-liners that he quips from the comic books and adds it to his film without ever over doing it. Along side his great action, pacing and realization of Spider-Man it's backed with a thumping score which breaks into moments of greatness as it reaches different tones, a heavy standout being the horror track that backs a lot of The Lizard scenes. Along with some great direction from Webb showing one or two scenes of true horror making him an interesting choice from a film in that genre.Its not just Webb's directing that stands out, Garfield creates his own version of Spider-Man and not only captures it but embodies it. It's a role he was born to play and it's evident that he's enjoying every scene he's in playing this character, alongside playing Parker. Being a surprising addition to the cast is Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben who brings a more heartfelt and lovable interpretation to the role that the other films were never able to capture. Ifans is a great choice for Connors as well and dominates the scenes he's in with his strong presence being felt. It's just a shame this is lost when he becomes The Lizard and the CGI creation becomes a cheesy mess with no real threat or character as the computer generate scenes play out. The most disappointing of all however is the character of Gwen Stacey. As strong as Stones performance is the character is not. She feels more like a plot device at times than a genuine love interest for Spider-Man and since their relationship grows so fast it's hard to really grab anything from what you're being given.The biggest problem with the film however is the script, which Webb manages to keep on top, but not without it's flaws. At times it comes an inconsistent mess, for example in one scene Parker would touch an object which would suddenly stick to his hand and then the next scene he would be able to grab objects with ease, but then after this would go back to the prior problem. There's also some forced narrative choices as well, especially the scene in which Parker comes up with the idea for his suit which felt completely un-natural and a jolt out of the story. Alongside some forced plot ideas were certain plot strands that were left un- resolved, a main one involving Uncle Ben that reaches a crescendo and then never ties it's self up. The whole script feels unfinished and flips between a positive storytelling experience to a completely unpolished one.However despite these flaws Webb manages to keep the film afloat with some great characters, exciting action and an enjoyable time overall. Audiences should not soon forget though how great Sam Raimi captured Spider-Man in his direction though and the chemistry of the cast, each having their own story arcs. It'll be interesting to see where Webb takes his creation, as there's a lot here to like, just a weak script and some un-polished characters stop it from being the greatness it could have been. With films such as ""The Avengers"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" being the heavy weight superhero films to storm multiplexes it's hard to see ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" finding a heavy footing. But it's still worth checking out and will provide an entertaining two hours for audiences. There's still some web left in this spider after all.","1/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","christhebodishot","4 July 2012","After the last film, I was hard pressed to think that this one could be worse. Well, sure enough it is.Warning, spoilers ahead.The reasons that this film isn't good are simple: Most of the action scenes, take place at night- and are visually uninteresting as the CGI and night sky don't make good bedfellows. There is one action scene at day in which you can actually see what's going on, and its in a high school that clearly isn't anywhere within a three mile radius of New York.We all understand how they shoot interiors in Culver City.. But the last spiderman films seamlessly blended shoots from Chicago, New York, Los Angeles without the audience ever noticing. This film does not, in fact the only attempt to make the high school look like New York is a lame sign.This film's story has been done before, you've seen it before and with the exception of the Osbournes and the color of the love interests hair, there is not much new to this story.Dennis Leary is great, as is Martin Sheen but they're both killed off. Martin Sheen is killed off in the beginning of this boring movie, making it more painful as he was one of the only reliefs.Aunt May is written so poorly, that she has nothing to do in this movie. She sits at home and watches TV and screams at Peter when she sees him. Not exactly a challenging role for the great Sally Field.There was little care that went into the quality of this film, and the attempts at making it dark are just flat out Corny such as the cannibal rat, which is pure comedy and comes out of nowhere to 'shock' the audience.There seems to be no conflict between Peter and his girlfriend at the end of the story, which one would logically want to assume that she holds out some contempt for spiderman as Harry did in the original spiderman after Spiderman played a hand in his death. Spiderman did play a hand in the Captain's death, yet the daughter doesn't seem to mind that Peter was there when he was murdered.This film had great visual effects, obscured by the night time setting and slow down camera techniques. Other than that, it's a music video and it pulls NO surprises. You have already seen this film if you've seen the extended trailer, or the 2002 Green Goblin movie.The chemistry between the two leads is lame, with Andrew Garfield who is wonderful in other films and stage productions giving a few moments of over-acting that take away Peter's humanity and spell the word HAM with it. Also, they appear to be improvising in some of their scenes, the result is two young, MEGA-RICH people trying to imagine what blue- collared kids from Queen's social customs would be like, and let me tell you they FAIL in a telling and Inauthentic way.This movie does not have you believe in the setting or characters at all. It is just ridiculous.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Wuchakk","7 July 2017","Released in 2012 and directed by Marc Webb, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" stars Andrew Garfield as geeky teen Peter Parker, who is bit by a radioactive spider and acquires spider-like powers. Emma Stone plays his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, while Denis Leary plays her father, the captain of the NYPD. Rhys Ifans plays the one-armed Dr. Curt Connors, who develops a dubious serum which morphs him into a human Lizard. Sally Field and Martin Sheen appear as Aunt May & Uncle Ben whereas Irrfan Khan is on hand as Connor's suspicious superior.While this is a solid Spider-Man film with an effective cast it can't hold a candle to the film it reboots, 2002's ""Spider-Man,"" which was still fresh in the mind in 2012 (and still is). Compare the Spider-Man costumes, for instance, particularly the masks; there's no contest. The story is basically the same except that (1.) Gwen Stacy is the girlfriend instead of Mary Jane, (2.) the Lizard is the villain instead of the Green Goblin, (3.) Spider-Man uses artificial web-shooters rather than intrinsic ones, and (4.) Captain Stacy basically replaces J. Jonah Jameson.The movie run 142 minutes and was shot in New York City and Los Angeles (or points nearby).GRADE: B","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","dilipbts","10 June 2020","Being a Spider-man comic book fan I can say that a lot of the stuff that happens in this story is true to the comic book Spider-man. Spider-man has web shooters, Spider-man likes to joke a lot, Gwen Stacy was Spider-man's first love, etc. So Anyone who is a fan of the comics will respect this movie on that merit, the merit that it was faithful to the source material while bringing in new stuff without losing what made Spider-man who he is.People who've only seen the Spider-man films and never bothered to read any of the comics. Won't like this film as much. They'll say the same old stuff. ""Why was this made? We've seen this already?"" Blah blah blah.Let me go off saying that behind Spider-man 2, this is probably the best of the Spider-man trilogy for one reason.....it avoids all clich√©s that the original trilogy didn't. In fact the film pretty much avoids all clich√©s at all. I'll try and explain a few without spoiling the film.Well first of all the woman in this film aren't morons. One of the main problems I had with Sam Raimi's films was the fact that all woman were pretty much portrayed as objects that Spider-man can save. None of them do anything helpful. Sure Mary Jane tried to hit Doctor Octopus with a plank in the second film, but she couldn't even do that right. That's not the case here. Gwen actually has a confrontation with with villain and she doesn't screw around, I won't say what she does but when I saw it happen I couldn't help but cheer. Finally a Spider-man film where the woman have a brain-stem.The second clich√© it avoids is being predictable. The original films basically have Spider-man going through the motions. Girl gets kidnapped, Spidey saves girl, Spidey defeats villain or jumps out of the way so the villain can do harm to himself. That is not the case with this film, a lot of the time you think one thing is going to happen but then it doesn't and the opposite happens.The third clich√© it avoids is having silly moments. The first trilogy had a lot of them, yes even Spider-man 2 (The raindrops keep falling on my head scene). Going back an having re-watched the Sam Raimi trilogy before seeing this one, the films are more like popcorn films. Sam Raimi is the master at making B movies and that's what the original trilogy was, an epic scale B Movie. With this film, they get a little more serious. There's not really any goofy moments that I can think of and if there are then it's usually played for laughs.Also THANK GOD They got Flash Thompson right. Sam Raimi used Flash so he could be the stereotypical bully, and at the beginning you think that's what Marc Webb plans to do, but then he shows that Flash isn't as big a  as he makes himself out to be. Flash is one of my favourite Spider-man characters in the comics, and I'd like to say ""thank you Marc Webb for avoiding the clich√© of him just being a bully and actually making him a human being with depth."" The film also does other things right besides avoiding clich√©s. The actors all do fantastic jobs and I will go on record saying that Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-man and a great role model for young boys even though he has his flaws. Martin Sheen was great as an Uncle Ben who is kind, understanding, but at the same time doesn't take any crap. Emma Stone was great as the kind of jokey but intelligent Gwen Stacy who is a strong positive role model for young woman. The Guy who played the villain was great, The girl who played Aunt May was good in the few scenes she was in. Not a weak link in the bunch.So I've done nothing but praise this film so far, so why is it still behind Spider-man 2 in my books? Well the film does have flaw, mainly two. One it's rushed, the only one who really pays for it being rushed is the villain who only gets one line of dialogue to explain his motives and even then we're not sure why he's doing that. The second flaw is that it doesn't have this big epic feel that Spider-man 2 had, it doesn't feel like it was ma","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","rudicantfail","27 December 2021","Well, I was hoping for more, but was not nearly as entertained as I hoped I would be. The storyline was OK-ish, but I felt is was a touch too simplistic. I am not aware of the comic book history of Spiderman, it never appealed tome as a child, but surely, Spiderman would keep his identity hidden from everyone. In this movie, the Spiderman character seemed to spend most of the movie with his real identity exposed for all to see.. The acting was a bit wooden for me, but it is not the worst movie I have seen this festive season. 8 out 0f 10 is my festive spirit generosity score.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","muntaqaakhan","3 October 2021","When I heard about The Amazing Spider-Man, i thought another spider-man movie by Sam Raimi. Then, I saw the film and I was shocked that it was rebooted. I thought it would be bad or worse. I found it most entertaining and great. They shouldn't repeat the story of Peter Parker but I really enjoyed the film.What I didn't like was about his father. It would better why his parents ran away in the first film. The cast of the film especially, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans, were great.The film was so great and enjoyable. It regarded as an improvement of Previous Spider-Man films.","7/10"

The Peter Parker with the skateboard kind of didn't make sense as he isn't cool and stuff.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","smallasianman","19 June 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man begins with Peter Parker in high school. Though an amateur photographer, Peter's main interest is science - and he bluffs his way into an audience with his deceased father's ex-partner Dr Curt Connors. After impressing Connors with his knowledge of cross- species genetics, Peter enters a classified area and is bitten by a mutated spider. As his powers and secret identity develop, so too does his relationship with Connors prot√©g√©, and Parker's classmate, Gwen Stacey. But when the desperate Connors attempts to fight his personal weaknesses using the same untested method, he undergoes a more disastrous transformation into ""The Lizard"", a creature with a twisted view of how best to 'cure' humanity.The Amazing Spider-Man's origin story is undoubtedly an improvement on Raimi's Spider-Man, a decade prior. The characterisation is a lot more realistic, which makes it easier for the audience to feel Parker's teenage pain, awkwardness and ultimate escapism when he dons the guise of Spider-Man. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacey is also a welcome replacement for Mary-Jane, who's sole purpose in Raimi's films was either to moan or scream. Stacey by contrast, is an intelligent character in her own right, who doesn't shy away from getting her hands dirty when Spider- Man's in trouble. Rhys Ifans portrayal of Curt Connors has the same Jekyllian vulnerability seen in Mark Ruffallo's Bruce Banner earlier this year, although his motives are distorted somewhat as the film progresses.However, such interesting character development unfortunately does not hold together perfectly with the action. Of course, Spider-Man is foremost a movie that has to entertain; yet the cocky web-slinging CGI hero seems too unlike Garfield's brooding Peter Parker. The quality of the special effects is largely inconsistent, with POV scenes of Spider- Man diving around the city impressing greatly, whilst his actual battles with The Lizard are considerably less ambitious. The weighty retelling of Parker's familiar back-story also means that during the d√©nouement several large plot points, which could have expanded the action, are left undeveloped ‚Äì and so the ending is a little too simple and unsatisfactory.Webb has successfully addressed the new demand for superhero movies to be deeper and more human; yet he is not a director adept at providing big-budget action to an audience in the same way as Joss Whedon or Christopher Nolan. The Amazing Spider-Man is therefore the sum of two films, a satisfactory coming-of-age movie and an unchallenging action film. Unfortunately, Webb is not strong enough to convincingly hold the two together.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Dominic_25_","5 July 2022","This is Sony's first attempt at creating a superhero universe. Of course it didn't turn out spectacular. They were aiming for a setup film, not a solid film.Why did they cast a 30 year old Andrew Garfield and a 24 year old Emma Stone to play high schoolers?It has been a while since I've watched any movie so why not watch a superhero movie that was trying to capitalize on the growing trend. This film feels like it was trying it's hardest to be a hip cool start to a new universe. It starts with a setup for Peter's parents being secretive scientist types before just transitioning into teenage Peter being awkward and struggling with high school stuff. Peter finds his dad's stuff then investigates his work and gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider then works with his dad's old colleague on his work. If that sounds like a lot that is because it is. Not even half way through and it's pretty much a mystery of this science stuff his dad was involved in but wait then it kills Uncle Ben and turns into a vengeance story and finally we get to see Spider-Man, and he's literally just hunting down people that sort of look like this killer. He is obviously acting like a bad guy but the film makes it seem cool with Spidey tricks and banter. From here the plot devolves into nothing more than a tool to get to cool scenes and shots. Nothing interesting or logical happens, the second half is pretty much get to the big fight scenes and make it look cool.There are cool shots and I appreciate the film making NYPD look incompetent and unnecessarily violent.It takes a dark turn on superheroes by accident by toying with the authoritarian nature of the concept. I'm not a very big fan of this Peter, maybe it's because everything about his personal life is consulted for no reason, maybe it's Andrew Garfield's acting, maybe it's just that they don't do a very good job of making the character and letting him be a person. Instead we get the opening sequence then a montage before the movie throws random stuff at him and he makes the wrong decisions for most of the movie.Overall it's an uninspiring movie that gets to where it wants to go and tries to be interesting visually, which it largely succeeds at (especially compared to the MCU and their stale colors). Really just kind of forgettable.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","redcanofevil","15 December 2021","Doesn't quite reach the highs of the Sam Raimi films but not bad in anyway. Gets the vibe of a Spider-Man just right which other films fails to do so. The duality of Peter the highschooler and Spider-Man the superhero was very much front and centre even tho not all it does worksFor starters an infinitely better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire. When I picture Spider-Man from the comics its the closest to Andrew Garfield. Also a very solid Peter Parker but the script lets him down most of the time. The shy, nerdy, quippy and tormented highschool Peter was well handled altho a little less stuttering would've been nice. My only complaint would be Andrew looks older than the age he is supposed to be at times.One of the best chemistry in a Spider-Man movie with Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone who was perfect in the role. Tobey-Dunst felt very artificial whereas Andrew-Emma is so free flowing and organic. Gwen was always my favorite Spidey girl and this movie proves itAction scenes have been vastly improved and altho its still CGI looking it gets the Spider-Man fighting style perfectly. Not the best of casting choices for the villain and the lizard design looked weird trying to make it as realistic as possible.As for the duality aspect it is surprisingly emotional and very well acted for the most part. But the script really doesn't help the actors and the direction also lets it down at timesThere is not much wrong with it its just that its not as good as the 1st 2 Raimi films. Don't get me wrong this is a better Spider-Man movie than all the Sam Raimi films but the Sam Raimi films were better movies. Its just not as tight and cohesive even tho it gets Spider-Man closer than all the other attempts. For all its effort it does lack in iconic moments and doesn't have many nostalgic moments as the Sam Raimi run.RATING: 8/10.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Platypuschow","5 February 2018","I was deeply unhappy when I heard about the filming of The Amazing Spider-Man, I believe in original ideas and with something as broad as Spiderman at least giving it a decent length of time before ""Rebooting"".It was too soon, the quality of the McGuire trilogy is irrelevant it was simply too soon to be starting again. Yet another origin story, another introduction to Gwen, another uncle Ben death scene and another villian.Andrew Garfield is dull, he simply didn't cut it as Spiderman and I consider Emma Stone to be one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood so the newly reborn franchise wasn't off to a great start in my eyes.So at over two hours at least they gave the movie a chance to shine, alas it doesn't though it's not the complete train wreck I expected.In this outing (And origin) Parker takes on The Lizard played by the always excellent Rhys Ifans who is simply too good for this movie.It has its moments but for $230 million it damn well should have had considerably more.The Good:Crane scene was greatLizard looked decentDennis Leary & Rhys IfansThe Bad:I really don't like Andrew GarfieldWeak soundtrackWas simply too soon after the last ""Reboot""Things I Learnt From This Movie:Some Lizards can grow limbs back at will...........at will!?Along with super powers spider bites also provide personalities","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","IonicBreezeMachine","2 January 2022","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is an intelligent high school outsider. As a boy Peter was left by his parents Richard and Mary (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) to be raised by aunt May and uncle Ben (Sally Field and Martin Sheen) only for Richard and Mary to mysteriously die in a plane crash shortly thereafter. Peter evidentially stumbles upon his father's personal effects which leads him to investigate bio-science company Oscorp and one of Richard's colleagues, Dr. Curtis Conners (Rhys Ifans), who worked with Richard on cross-species genetics. Peter investigates Oscorp where classmate and crush, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) works as an intern and Peter is bitten by a spider from one of the labs. Eventually Peter starts to exhibit enhanced strength as well as the ability to stick to walls and following the death of his Uncle Ben begins to form a reputation as masked vigilante Spider-Man and at odds with the police department headed by Gwen's father George Stacy (Dennis Leary). Meanwhile, Dr. Connors is under increasing pressure from Oscorp's dying CEO Norman Osborn and using a compound made from lizard DNA based on Richard Parker's formula ends up becoming a reptilian human hybrid, known as The Lizard, intent on spreading the compound throughout the city.Following the commercial success of Spider-Man 3, Sony and Sam Raimi had every intention of moving forward with Spider-Man 4 as well as preliminary discussions regarding Spider-Man 5 and 6, however the mixed critical and fan feedback lead to tensions between Raimi and the studio as the overcluttered narrative of Spider-Man 3 was the result of Sony's insistence on Venom's inclusion to plant seeds for a spin-off and with Raimi suffering from burnout from the tumultuous development cycle of Spider-Man 3 and already butting heads with Sony over whether The Lizard or The Vulture would be the primary antagonist, Raimi departed from Spider-Man 4 and the rest of the cast soon followed suit. Sony had already planned for such a contingency with writer James Vanderbilt producing a treatment that would eventually be directed by 500 Days of Summer director Marc Webb and feature Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. The results despite covering familiar ground were surprisingly good and gave a different experience from the Raimi movies.Andrew Garfield gives a more contemporary take on the character with his interpretation of Peter Parker being less in line with the broad silver age inspired take of Magurie's Peter Parker and mining the more contemporaneous attitude of ""Nerd culture"" that's much more mainstream than it was in the 1960s. While Peter is still very much an outsider in High School, the portrayal of it feels like an attempt to ground it more in our reality than the previous Sam Raimi movies that were trying to replicate the environment and delivery of the 60s comics and characters but placed in modern day. The Peter Parker of The Amazing Spider-Man is also a much more active protagonist where Peter's story in the opening almost plays him like a teen sleuth with the lingering mystery of his parents connection with Oscorp as well as their death in a plane crash used for some tense scenes that also work in justifying Peter going to Oscorp where he receives his Spider powers from the bite. Emma Stone is also quite good as Gwen Stacy who not only has strong chemistry with Peter and works as a love interest, but her relationship with Peter where she becomes the only Confidant of Peter's who knows he's Spider-Man as well as a intellectual equal to Peter gives her more agency as a character than Mary Jane Watson had from the Raimi movies with some solid scenes of Stacy assisting Spider-Man. Rhys Ifans is good playing damaged scientist Curtis Conners and the scenes Ifans shares with Garfield are really solid as Peter learns about his father from Conners while Curtis also sees a bit of Richard in Peter and there's a strong undercurrent to these scenes that make them very rich in character. Ifans also does well portraying Conners' transformation into The Lizard in a way that's more than a little reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum's take from the David Cronenberg helmed The Fly remake.The action are really solid as they build upon techniques from the Raimi movies but also adjust them to the new world created by the movie. Unlike the Raimi version of Peter, this incarnation of Peter doesn't shoot webs from his wrists and is positioned as a technically accomplished genius with his web shooters gadgets that he builds using Oscorp tech. There's also a lot more weight to the action and some solid scenes showing Peter's rough Spider-Man costume to the eventual final costume.The major points of criticism I think will be in regards to the retelling of Spider-Man's origin story and in the Oscorp conspiracy plotline involving Peter's parents that while inspired from revelations in the comic-book does feel at odds with Spider-Man's everyman core. While the movie does give us different takes on Aunt May and Uncle Ben that have more dimensionality than they had in the Raimi films, it doesn't disguise the fact that we already know Uncle Ben's story significance and what happens to him. I also didn't feel like Sally Field's take on Aunt May ever achieved the level of chemistry with Garfield's Peter that Rosemary Harris had with Tobey Maguire in the Raimi films. The movie also doesn't give us much satisfaction in its conspiracy plotline that's pretty obviously set-up to be a driver for sequelization.The Amazing Spider-Man works well as an origin story for a new take on Peter Parker. With a strong supporting cast and some exhilarating fight scenes, the movie manages to overcome its origin story baggage with a mostly successful take on the character and lore. While the background plot involving the mysteries behind Peter Parker's parents is inspired from developments in the comic book, whether you like it or not will vary from person to person.","10/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","spiderdan101","15 June 2013","First off, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Dennis are all Perfect in their roles. This movie is very different from the original, except for the origins which can obviously not be changed. The action is what spidey fans have always dreamed off. The chemistry between peter and Gwen is priceless. New and interesting story lines are created to be explored through out the trilogy/saga. The new suit is great in my opinion, but it has been changed for the sequel, yet either way I like them both. Andrew Garfield's emotional scenes are unbelievable. Finally, I absolutely loved the humor. And the ending left me satisfied and happy, yet excited for what is yet to come. Overall, this is an origin that succeeds on many levels and out does the previous origin (which is still great) and only Spider-man 2 is equal in its acting, style, humor, action, and theme.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","samsenna","16 December 2021","We can't deny that Andrew's performance as Peter Parker is absolutely phenomenal. He's an extremely talented actor, and it's safe to say that the reason why this movie didn't get such a high rating might be because people weren't pleased knowing that someone else would be taking up this role after Tobey. Some might have been disappointed, but the truth is that this movie is incredible. For me, I've never seen anyone bring such a role to life as well as Andrew. Props to him for delivering the way he did! He will always be the amazing Spider-Man.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","dp-17275","26 February 2019","It's a good movie, I recommend it. It really does nothing new with the Spider-man character but its a fun watch. Andrew Garfield fits into the role of Spider-man perfectly, but struggles to become Peter Parker; since Andrew Garfield does not have that same boyish charm Tobey Maguire had, he is not a nerd and you never believe it. The villain is pretty good, very over the top, but in the first 40 minutes he's interesting and unique, until he isn't. The villain is the lizard and seeing him fighting Spider-man is fun. The music is acceptable, it gives Spider-man a nice theme you can hum and the movie is quite inspiring. The end fight is very fun to watch and if you invest in the characters enough, you can feel some emotion in the end. Gwen Stacy is an excellent character and has great chemistry with Peter Parker. The origin story is kinda fascinating until you realize it's a more dumb downed version of the Raimi origin story. Uncle Ben literally says 'with great power comes great responsibility' but he couldn't say that exactly because then people would accuse it of being too similar, instead he says ""Your father had a philosophy, that if you could do good things for other people, you would've had a moral obligation to do those things. that's whats at stake, not choice....Responsibility' such a dumb downed speech. Excellent special effects and sometimes does feel like an attempt to 'Dark knight' Spider-man but regardless of that it's a very fun movie and I highly recommend watching it but don't try to compare it with the original because then it won't be fun.","7/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","StoryTaker1","3 May 2019","I guess whether or not we like a super-hero movie depends on what we are looking for in it. I want them to inspire me to always strive to be the best version of myself. I want them to unapologetically show heroes being heroes, without caring if that makes them 'cheesy', protecting and defending more than they attack, constantly learning from life and from others, overcoming personal struggles and losses, using their brain more than their brawn etc. I especially love any story where the protagonist is smart and a fellow nerd. This movie does it all for me.Garfield might be too good looking to pass off as a bullied teenager, but he made up for that with his acting. He portrayed perfectly the awkwardness that bullies would hone in as a weakness, the need for validation that comes from this and from losing his parents that led him to give the formula away so callously to please Dr Connors, the rebelliousness and teenage angst etc. I also liked the tragic arc of Dr Connors and how his path to the dark side was paved with good intentions. I also liked all the side characters and Gwen. The humour was also on point, as was the music.More importantly, I like and admire the Peter Parker in this movie. He is a true hero through and through who is also incredibly smart and can build his own suit and solve his own problems unlike in certain other adaptations.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","2 June 2018","I loved the SPIDER-MAN trilogy starring Tobey Maguire a lot. At first, I didn't understand why he was no longer in this movie, but after catching it just a few weeks ago on DVD, I can say that this a very cool SPIDER-MAN movie. The title is apt. The film is replete with cool action, vibrant VFX, a great execution, and of course, loads of entertainment.Andrew Garfield plays a very cool Peter Parker, much different from the one played by Tobey. But I never compared them both because it's clearly visible that both actors have portrayed different ages of SPIDER-MAN and shine in their respective parts. Andrew however also shows the hilarious side of his web -shooting alter ego very well. Emma Stone has a great chemistry with him, and acts well for the most part. Rhys Ifans is impressive as both Connors as well as the Lizard. It was a very pleasant surprise to see Irrfan Khan in the film, and he played his brief yet significant part with utmost sincerity. Martin Sheen did a good job as Uncle Ben, while Sally Field too portrayed Aunt May with an emotional flair. Denis Leary is impressive, while Stan Lee too has a funny cameo in the film.Coming to the technical department, it's hands down a very impressive film. The entire visual effects which make Lizard are marvellous. The best visual effects in the film, however, are in the climax. The action is simply outstanding. Every action sequence is impressive, and the final action block which also has added emotional and inspirational depth, is highly impressive and entertaining. The film has a lot of funny as well as emotional moments. Undoubtedly, there are some similar points as in SPIDER-MAN, but Marc Webb's direction makes this reboot, an all new and all different experience as a whole.","1/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Movie-ManDan","19 October 2014","Spiderman 1 and 2 were masterpieces. Spiderman 3 in 2007 caught a bad rap because it was much inferior to the previous ones. So they rebooted the series. Thing is, they did it way too soon: 5 years after the finishing if the original. Everything would have been so much better is they waited longer. But noooo! I watched this with an unbiased conscience and did not expect it to be as good as the original. Many times whenever I have low expectations, I am proved wrong. Not with this.Let me start off with the story. Peter Parker is left in the care of his aunt and uncle some time before his parents die. Years later, as an emotionally scarred teen, Peter finds some answers about his parents that change him forever. The only thing good about this is giving a backstory to Peter and his parents. Nothing on Peter's childhood involving his parents were mentioned in 2002's. Props there. Plus there is lots of science involved, so any science nerds would love that aspect. I hate science, but thought it made great filming. In general the story has a good pace, but it is so unoriginal. A teen trying to find his place in the world has been done so many times with this not being any different. Then there is the love story between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey. Sure the chemistry between them was better than original movies, but this is so unoriginal and boring. Peter gets the girl after the first try and it turns into cheesy Channing Tatum/Patrick Swayze love fest that makes you reach for a barf bag.Now let's talk about characters. Martin Sheen wasn't a bad Uncle Ben, but his death scene was hilarious and forgettable. Sally Field sucked and Aunt May. The ones that played them in the original were much better and the relationship between them and Peter were much, much stronger. Flash was not a good bully. Curt Connors (acting wise ) was good, but was a crappy villain. James Franco, whom I thought was the worst villain in the previous was better than Connors. Gwen Stacey was likable, but unoriginal. Her father was likable, but unoriginal. Peter was likable, but inferior to Tobey's. Andrew Garfield does not do a good job of playing a meek, timid, geeky teenager. Tobey owns that portion. Garfield just looks like a One Direction dude with glasses and a skateboard. People say Garfield was wittier and did more wisecracks like in the comic. Tobey did wisecracks too, but Garfields are too long and unfunny. Busting the car thief was extremely dumb. Tobey would have done one line and kicked his ass. After becoming Spiderman, Garfield doesn't really change, staying a confused, sad teen with no goal in life, except finding his parents' history. That makes him one-dimensional. Tobey goes from being a total geek to a sophisticated gentleman. Tobey outacts and outdoes Garfield in every was. Tobey also gained lots of muscle and easily could have whooped Garfield's skinny ass.Lastly the movie itself. Spidey's suit looked sick. Better than Tobey's? Maybe. Science thing superior to the oldies? Yes. Uncle Ben's death? Hilarious, and all because Peter couldn't get a bootle of milk he could not afford. Peter's ambition? gives up pretty easily finding his uncle's killer and is dead-set on finding his parents' history. Peter's family background? Better than the others by explaining his parents, which barely do! I know that they wanted to make the viewer want to see the sequel but going through a full movie just saying where they worked sucks. Peter exploring his new powers? Pathetic! Spidey saving a kid? Both almost died because of Peter's sheer stupidity of negotiating with a 6-year- old! The lizard villain? Looks exactly like that Jim Henson kiddie show from the 90s called ""Dinosaurs."" Action good? Yes. But there's many parts where the camera shakes at such a wide range with no focus for so long while Spidey's flying around, you may need your barf bag again.Final thoughts. This movie was not bad, nor good. The action saved what was a major stinker. The story isn't boring, there's just unoriginality and stupidity surrounding it. And it is very forgettable. I noted specific things in this review because I watched this just yesterday. Yet I still forget half of it!1.5/4","8/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","ForTwentyYears","8 July 2012","Perhaps it is because I'm not an needlessly cynical old man lacking a sense of humour, but many reviews I've read are unfair. I just got back from the cinema, and I was so so so surprised by the awesomeness of this movie. I remember enjoying the first Spider-Man but this just completely blew that out of the water. Firstly, I think I laughed more at this film than most comedy movies. I was literally in hysterics at some of it - as was everyone else in the cinema. Namely, the part where a robber gets out a knife and Spider-Man cowers on the floor saying sarcastically something like ""oh no you found my weakness - it's small knives"" before whipping up and shooting his badass webs at the dude. Oh god I laughed so much. And this part where he first gets bitten, comes home, proclaims he is hungry and proceeds to taking an armful of /frozen/ food upstairs while his aunt an uncle just stand there looking utterly confused. Honestly it was just hilarious. When he wakes up in the morning and practically demolishes his bathroom and all the doors. After kissing his girlfriend ""I'm going to throw you out of the window now."" ""Wha-?"" SMASH! Hahaha. Sarcastic protagonists make every film better. I want to see it all again! The story was also good, I liked the way the webs didn't just blast out of his fingers without reason but instead he created them from wires. And the whole sci-fi aspect was really interesting. It was a great curveball that Connors didn't actually start out evil but in fact it was almost Peter's fault he turned all lizard-y. There were also some really emotional parts, and I won't say I didn't cry because the development and everything just made them tenfold more heart-wrenching! I also thought it was good that they kept the human aspect of the superhero - he get's injured and he feels pain which, to me, isn't a weakness it's just inevitability. ACTORS. Oh my god. They were all epic as hell. Garfield was just amazing, it was a completely different role from The Social Network and yet he slotted into it so naturally. He got the emotion, connection, humour and just everything down to a T. Emma Stone was also beautifully flirty and awesome. I was glad she wasn't the usual whiny, helpless female sidekick. Every single actor was FLAWLESS.The visuals were also very aesthetically pleasing. Camera angles and scenes which made the 3D aspect perfect. I'm also very happy that they didn't go down the whole ""OMG CRAM IT FULL OF CGI AND DAZZLING MONSTERS SO THEY DON'T NOTICE THE CRAPPY PLOT L0L"" route.My only downside is the backstory which didn't fit together or wasn't fully explained in some parts, but it didn't really matter because the rest was so satisfying. I've seen people say Parker and Spider-Man were too different in personality, but honestly did they not catch the ""your boyfriend is a man of many masks"" part? Or the part with the kid where he wears the mask and it makes him brave? It's obviously like bravado. At least, in my opinion.Oh I absolutely loved the ending, when he breaks up with Gwen because of the promise. Then when he comes into class late and promises never to be late again, to which the teacher replies ""Peter, don't make promises you can't keep"" and as he sits down behind Gwen he whispers ""but those are the best kind.""To conclude, it was a wonderful entertaining movie which I thoroughly enjoyed. Ignore the whiny negative reviews!","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","sherring8290","15 July 2012","This is a new origin tale of Spider-Man and how he came to be. Rather than action driven sequences, The Amazing Spider-Man consistently uses the strengths of its actors to create a compelling story and characters the audience cares about. Columbia pictures not only told me we are indeed ready to re-visit Spider-Man's Universe, but ready to finally do it right in the process.The Amazing Spider-Man takes us on the journey of Peter Parker, a bullied, self-classified science nerd. On an uninvited trip to Oscorp in attempt to discover more about his perished father, Peter gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider. After this event everything changes. It's a familiar story to those who have seen the original Spider-Man trilogy, but how this story is told is what makes it different. Almost two thirds of the entire film is dedicated to character development and it sure paid off.Andrew Garfield plays Peter Parker in this reinterpretation to the world of Spider-Man, and he couldn't be a better fit. Not only does he simply fit the suit better, he adds a level of emotion and comedy that Tobey Maguire severely lacked. The Spider-Man of the comic books was sassy during fights, spouting off insults and egging his opponents on; The Amazing Spider-Man nailed the character perfectly.Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, a science wiz intern at Oscorp, and Peter's love interest. She does an excellent job of stealing the spotlight while on screen and remaining an afterthought while off of it. One scene in particular I enjoyed was the first time Gwen and Peter try to set up a date. Their innocence and insecurity is highlighted as they fumble for words which provided not only humor but a chance for the audience to connect with both leading characters.Rhys Ifans plays Dr. Curt Connors, a top scientist at Oscorp studying cross genetic mutation, and ironically ""The Lizard"" as well. This was one character that I felt lacked in some areas. As a scientist Ifans nails it; he shows absolute interest in the studies and even possesses the personal goal of re-growing his right arm. Where the character falls apart is when the Lizard is introduced. After a certain point his goal completely changed: he was no longer about the science but purely selfish.Other actors that gave excellent performances are Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy, Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben, and Sally Field as Aunt May. Their performances were over shadowed by the main three but I felt they deserved a mention.Villains are a huge part to any super hero movie or comic and unfortunately this is the one area I feel this film falters. The lizard just didn't do it for me; he isn't the evil villain many including myself were hoping for. A scientist trying to cure his own ailment turned evil, which was not well explained causing a small hole in the plot.The writers of The Amazing Spider-Man are clearly avid fans of the comic books and the accuracy of details really paid off. Attention to details like the fact Spider-Man made his web slingers (he did not possess the ability internally as shown in the original Spider-Man films) really increased the likability of the characters and script.The Amazing Spider-Man is just short of amazing, which is no small feat for the folks at Columbia Pictures. Should this film be the success it is expected to be, sequels will no doubt come, and frankly I can't wait. This film not only left me wanting more but revitalized my faith in the genre. Oh, don't forget to stay for the credits! There is a short clip giving hints of what's to come.see more reviews at http://www.thosetwoguysonline.com","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","The_Celluloid_Sage","6 April 2020","With a director called Webb, how could this not be amazing? Exactly, this is streets ahead of Raimi's offerings (despite personally being a huge Sam Raimi fan) but they really were too mushy and casual for my liking. Sony's new reboot of Marvel's Spider-Man hits all the right notes in my opinion, especially in the casting department. Maguire was just too...well, too wet for my liking. I have nothing against the guy so whether it was direction or script I'm not sure (or he just isn't an actor suited for that role). Garfield on the other hand nails the portrayal of Peter Parker as far as I am concerned with his geeky, cocky and youthful portrayal of everyone's favourite web-slinger.The film opens to Peter (Garfield) shouting for his father in his fathers study. Drawers are open, papers thrown around and the room is in a state of general disarray. Peter's parents are hurriedly running around before leaving the house with him. They take Peter to his Uncle Ben's (Sheen) and Aunt May's (Field) house where he tries to eavesdrop on the conversation they have. Peter's parents then leave him there as they leave. We then quickly fast forward to the present day and to a teenage Peter along with all of his teenage problems and issues. During a clean out of the basement with his uncle Ben, Peter comes across a leather briefcase that belonged to his father leading to Peter to start investigating their disappearance all those years ago.Ok so let us start with the major talking points regarding this film. Was it completely unnecessary and unneeded? Very likely so yes. Does that make it a pointless film? One could argue that yes it does (and I hate remakes, reboots, re-imaginings and re-whatever else) and this would fall into that category. Do I hold the same view with this film as say something like Tarantino ripping off every great foreign film he has ever seen? No I don't. Why? Well maybe I am a hypocrite and also maybe I don't really see superhero films or franchises like this being the same as a classic one-off film. Hell, this franchise has been done to death over the years, and yes I include the awesomely, terribly bad short-lived TV series too. Was five years long enough to wait to reboot the character again? I guess your mileage will vary depending on your personal opinion of the previous three films.My personal opinion of the three preceding films wasn't great if I'm being honest. I'm sure many will hold them in high regard as the first decent Spider-Man films to have come along. I didn't for various reasons, including those I stated above. Was it also right or wrong for Sony to re-use many scenes or make them similar? Another debatable point indeed but they did and so it is what it is. The only thing there, is did they manage to improve on those instances. I for one think they did. Was the former trying to be a more mature Spider-Man rather than this version? I think they were aiming for that, but Maguire and Dunstan (in my opinion) ruined any chances of that along with the script they had to work with. Is this iteration perhaps aimed at a more younger audience? I would say so yes and I think it works, while this one also has its darker moments.So what does this new reboot version have going for it? Well for one, and this is a big one, Garfield is head and shoulders better than Maguire in pretty much every aspect for me. His looks, his physique (and let's all remember folks and remove the rose-tinted from the Raimi films, Spidey was never big, never overly muscular or imposing in any way). Garfield was perfectly cast, acts the character wonderfully and is brilliant with his cockiness and the old Spidey sarcasm. My biggest issues with the Raimi films though is, Spidey wasn't really Spidey at all. Maybe I am biased with this one but I also feel the interaction between Peter and Gwen (Stone) is infinitely better, but then maybe I just prefer Emma to Kirsten.The rest of the cast are equally as good, Ifans, Sheen and Leary all shine, though it is a shame (personally) that sheen did not have more screen time, but the time he does fill he fills big. Sally Field really doesn't have a lot to do in this one and is somewhat wasted for someone with her credentials, but like the others she does add a star quality and a 'name' to the cast. Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors is excellent and hams it up wonderfully as The Lizard. Likewise, Leary is near faultless as Gwen's father and Captain of the force. Other supporting characters are well cast and all play their parts well enough.Another plus I have for this film is that it takes much longer for Peter to become Spider-Man. We get a lot more back-story regarding Peter and what happened with his parents than we ever did in the previous trilogy. I feel this is to the betterment of this new reboot and works well with our new antsy Parker. We learn more about Peter and thus connect with him better. The second huge plus for me is the web shooters. what was Raimi thinking in all seriousness? Back to how it should be, Peter showing his genius and intellect by designing his wrist worn web shooters. How they always have been, how they always should be. Spider-Man is just physically enhanced due to the spider toxins. He is not Brundle spider.It really is a shame that Marvel did not keep Garfield on in the role of Parker/Spider-Man as I feel he really brought something to the suit. Overall though this is a funnier, less nerdy, more intricate telling of Spider-Man and his origins with a much more human and believable Peter Parker. if you have seen the Raimi trilogy and not caught this yet, just keep an open mind and enjoy a visually good looking film which is based in more physical reality. If you have not seen any of them, I personally really would just stick with this. Sorry Sam.The Sage's Rating: 7/10","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","StonedMagician","27 July 2019","Reboots/remakes are very controversial (let alone common) in Hollywood these days. Some of them have been welcomed (Star Trek, Casino Royale), and others not (Let Me In). The Amazing Spider Man, a reboot of the franchise begun by Sam Raimi's 2002 film, is one of the latter. Many critics seem predisposed to disregard this film, given the extremely positive response the original received. A similar thing happened when Let Me In first premiered: do we really need this movie, when the original was both great and relatively recent? The answer, of course, is no. But the fact remains that it exists, so critics should leave their grudges behind and concentrate on the film itself. Sam Raimi's version made light work of Peter Parker's transformation. Sure, the general concepts were in place; he gets bitten by a mutant spider, develops superhuman powers (though he cannot generate the webs himself in this version), and sees Uncle Ben get gunned down. And really, that was about it. Marc Webb, known for his well-handled rom-com 500 Days of Summer, imbues Spidey's origins with considerable depth and humanity. When Parker discovers his uncle's killer sports a tattoo, he pins any crook he can find to the wall to check if they're the right one. The chief of police points out that Spider Man doesn't seem to have any agenda, and is nothing more than a vigilante. After this, Peter seemingly decides that he can do far more than simply take vengeance, and decides to take on the real menace, The Lizard. Of Sam Raimi's trilogy, the best villain was Doc Ock, from Spider Man 2. As a character, he was fascinating, and brilliantly acted by Alfred Molina. The Lizard, whose human form is portrayed by Rhys Ifans, is little more than a miniaturized Godzilla with a plan. While Ifans plays his part quite well, The Lizard is simply not as charismatic or terrifying as Ock was. Like DOc Ock, however, The Lizard (AKA Curt Connors) is a sympathetic villain, with (initially) benign intentions that are completely understandable, and enough to pity him by the end of the film. Peter's love interest is Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), a smart, pretty, resourceful young woman who also happens to be the daughter of the police chief. She and Parker (Andrew Garfield) share excellent chemistry in their interactions, which director Webb exploits to its fullest potential. Their romance seems many times more genuine than that between Parker and Mary Jane from Raimi's trilogy. Parker himself is just as likeable, and far more unsure of himself. In this version, he stutters sometimes, and seems like the type of socially awkward nerd stereotype that everyone seems know someone like. It makes him easier to relate to, and thus easier to accept as a character, adding immeasurably to the film's human side. The other side of the film, of course, is the CGI-driven action. Sam Raimi, employed his signature style to his action, meaning that everything was complete chaos. Entertaining to be sure, but not always easy to follow. Webb anchors everything firmly in the realm of possibility (or at least as close as it can get), and there are no crazy gadgets flying through the air this time. Now, it's only Spider Man, the cops, and The Lizard. It all feels much more efficient and streamlined as a result, and becomes all the more thrilling because of it. Overall, I would recommend the reboot over the original, but only just. Sam Raimi may not have handled the dialogue and story as well, but is much more confident and fluid in the action space. When the inevitable sequel comes around, Webb might be able to take more risks with the web-sliging and baddy-wrangling, but until then, this is a very good film that no Spidey fan, casual or otherwise, should pass up.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","mrooney98","3 July 2012","I enjoyed this movie because it was a superhero film with many funny bits. I like to be able to laugh while watching a movie, not just watch loads of CGI action. I also liked the fact that the villain wasn't killed just defeated and put in prison, giving him a second chance. However, I do believe that was partially do to the fact that the producers/writers wanted something to write a future film on. I think that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did exceptionally in their roles. Garfield really seemed to actually be Peter Parker and I love to see that in a film. Although this movie is a superhero movie I do believe it was geared toward a younger audience, unlike the Dark Knight. The fact that Spider-man is a teenager in this one and that it is not nearly as dark as some other films certainly convinced me of this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys action and superheroes. Side note: Denis Leary was great!","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","philipjkite","3 July 2012","I don't like to be the downer on this movie, but I've just got back from watching it at my local cinema and I've already forgotten about it! I was expecting good things, 215 million spent on the movie, Emma Stone (big fan), Andrew Garfield (up and coming, great in Social Network) and Martin Sheen as a co-star, come on it should have been better.I got lost in the lack of a plot, it felt like it all happened over a day or two, the acting was limited, even Emma Stone only seemed to convince in a few scenes. At times it was as if I'd gone back in time and was stuck watching the Hulk again! please, please, not again! It just seemed so mixed up,there were a few, and when I say a few, I mean more than two! decent scenes! a couple of jokes thrown in, but then it was back to mediocre, what the heck happened to Denis Leary, after Rescue Me, you'd think that this guy could act now.For me, and this is only my humble opinion, it was a bid disappointment that made me wonder why I went in the first place. Once again Hollywood got me, with their big budget advertising machine. But maybe it's me, IMDb's never wrong is it? and maybe, just maybe, as I didn't watch it in 3D and could see the movie this time, I'm wrong!","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Hayden-86055","13 February 2021","It's not going to win any awards but it has some amazing special effects and Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone both play their roles really well I thought, it starts the Spiderman story again and whilst it's not as good as Sam Raimi's trilogy it's still a good film and works as a standalone.7/10: I wouldn't watch it over Tobey Maguire but it's fine for general Spidey fans","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","george.schmidt","8 July 2012","THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (2012) ***1/2 Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Irrfan Khan, Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz, C. Thomas Howell. Unnecessary but entertaining none-the-less blockbuster reboot to the epic Marvel franchise in its re-imagining of the Peter Parker mythos of his web-slinging alter ego super hero whose origin story should now be known to every man, woman and child. Garfield - exuding James Dean cool/geekiness as the awkward teen - is indelible as he tries to find out who he is, why he is and how to use his powers for greater things (that's right crime fighting). Ifans is reptilian to the hilt as anger management in denial Dr. Curt Connors, a one-armed colleague of Parker's late scientist genius dad attempting to use hybrid species DNA for re- growth of lost appendages and instead becomes the menacing Lizard. Added to the mix is Stone as Pete's gal pal Gwen Stacy and a nice laconic by-the-book Leary police chief dad out to stop the masked vigilante in the jungles of Manhattan. Director Marc Webb (no puns please) does a remarkable, skillful and unlikely heir-apparent helmsman job with the Herculean task of making something old fresh and he's ably capable with a decent script by James Vanderbilt, Steve Kloves an Alvin Sargent (who scripted the last two SPIDER-MAN flicks under Sam Raimi's realm) and some truly vivid 3-D imagery CGI and fantastic lens work by John Schwartzman. Bonus: Stan 'The Man' Lee's fun cameo as a high school music librarian missing out on the action behind him! Get your web on!","9/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","preppy-3","19 July 2012","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a radioactive spider and has the powers of a spider and fights crime as Spider-Man. He also falls in love with beautiful Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) whose father (Denis Leary) just happens to be the chief of police and hates Spider-Man. Then there's doctor Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) develops a serum that he hopes will cure people of any ailment. He tries it on himself and becomes the Lizard who wants to wipe out the human race.OK--I never liked the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies. I thought he didn't look (or act) like Peter Parker and was WAY too low-key as an actor. Garfield looks like Parker--but his acting is terrible. He's all over the place and never seems to get a grip on his character's pain and anxiety. Also the film is slow-paced and--frankly--just boring. I kept looking at my watch! On the up side the acting (Grafield aside) was excellent. Martin Sheen and Sally Fields were great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Stone was sweet, innocent AND sexy as Gwen Stacy. Leary was good as Captain Stacy. It was also great to see Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz briefly as Peter's parents. The CGI and special effects were flawless--but we've seen this all before. There's no sense of wonder and amazement at what Spider-Man can do. We KNOW it's done by computers and that robs it of any sense of magic it might have. Boring and badly done. I give it a 2.","2/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","interquam","29 June 2012","Emma stone and Andrew Garfield spend a lot of time in each others breath.An ensemble cast that is superior to other films with a pathetic story and average cinematography. A very good script with good actors and failing plot.Mr Sam Raimi should have made this movie keeping the actors same including the screen-play.Fairly good direction but i don't want to pay for seeing school-kids lick and salivate in each others mouths.Maybe if they would have taken Sharlto Copley instead of Rhys Ifans i would have added another 3 stars.Its a romantic movie gyrating around the emotions of school kids peter parker and Gwen Stacy .......everything else takes a backseat. I was bugged and so i went to take a leak during their kiss.Technically the movie is flawed. The spiderweb is not produced by his own body i reckon, but a device he built that produces the web. Another thing CGI is crap. You don't expect it to get overlooked with cheap multi-core chips and GPU's. Sub-standard quality-less animations.Oh! the bad guy-- a giant lizard that can easily be squashed by a freight train or truck........Duh.Much better than Prometheus because actors are very good.I would applaud Andrew, martin,Chris Zylka, the whole cast and the screenplay guys for making this film OK.....the story and romance just makes me crap in my pants.Too much melodrama and emotion.Spiderman 3 can be renamed: The Amazing spider-man.","10/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","tareqzaghal","2 September 2023","Watching these after the Raimi films really exposes how the Webb films lacked a lot of heart and mistakenly chose to focus on the 'edgy' post-TDK/Chronicle comic-book approach. The first half of the film is really melodramatic, and it feels like the film does not organically reach any of the key Spider-Man story tropes but feels obligated to check them off for the sake of the origin story, and in a very familiar and effortless way.I love Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man, but I do not enjoy his performance as Peter Parker in this first film. He comes off more of a dick than an innocent and helpless guy, which Tobey was able to perfectly capture. The whole film is very 2010-ish in every aspect, which sometimes provides a nice feeling of nostalgia but other times does not help the film at all.I would have preferred if the entire reboot skipped the origin story, but not in the way the MCU Spider-Man films did, but in the way the Spectacular Spider-Man animated show did. It could have provided a fresh take on the character for the big screen, as well as even avoiding repeating similar story beats to the Raimi films after only five years.On a technical aspect, there is some great cinematography especially during the fight scenes, with the high-school library sequence with the Lizard being one if my favourite Spider-Man fight scenes on film. Other than that, everything else is a bit uninspired honestly, nothing memorable.My favourite thing about this film (and the sequel) is the relationship between Garfield's Peter and Stone's Gwen, and their unbelievable chemistry. I love how she has an actual role to play in the film that is organic to the overall story, and it tied up well with her father's arc and the ending.This film's a bit over-hated imo but I do recognise it's many flaws. An overall enjoyable film that gad the impossible task of following up Raimi's trilogy.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","XweAponX","27 November 2012","Sam Raimi's 2002-2007 Trilogy was fantastic - He totally captured the essence of Spider-Man. But Marvel Comics themselves constantly re-tell the stories, and sometimes re-invent their superheroes, so also do Filmmakers who are telling, and in this care, re-telling these stories.Sam Raimi was not called on to do the re-telling, this time it went to newbie Marc Webb. How did he do? Not as well as Raimi did with his first two installments. But swell enough, to keep us interested. Is this an unnecessary re-telling? That's a big ""Nope.""Andrew Garfield is the new Peter Parker. He is less of a wimp than Tobey Maguire's version: Less of a wimp. But more of a geek. He's better at science than Maguire was. He Skateboards. He even stands up to Flash Thompson, stupidly, but he shows a measure of bravery, which Tobey lacked. He is also taller than Tobey Maguire.This new kid has it built in. he is intelligent, Maguire not so much. He's sharp, Maguire often did not know what was transpiring under his steamy glasses. He is not shy like Maguire was, where Maguire stood with thumb up it, Andrew Garfield acts. This is not to say I am not endeared to Tobey Maguire's version. But this new kid has his own way of doing it.We also delve into a subject that was not looked into very much in the Spidey Comics I had read-What happened to Parker's Parents, who they were, what did they do, and how Parker ended up with Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae? Campbell Scott is Richard Parker, a scientist working for Oscorp, and Embeth Davidtz is Mary Parker, Peter's doting mom. As a kid, Peter Parker was played by Max Charles. Sally Field is Aunt Mae and Uncle Ben is Martin Sheen: THIS I liked very much.Richard and Mary Parker are frightened by something. Their house has been burglarized. Richard has some secret papers in a hidden drawer: Peter sees this, he remembers. He remembers his father's leather attach√©, and the papers inside. But the Parkers are frightened, They drop Peter off at Uncle Ben's and are never seen again.Next Scene, Peter Parker is in High School, photographer for the school paper, geek, but respected. Has the gall to call Flash Thompson by his real first name, which he is rewarded with by a butt kicking. Enter Gwen Stacy aka Emma Stone. Perfect. She knows how to deal with Flash.A leak in the basement draws Peter's attention to his dad's Attache Case. There is a photo of Richard Parker with ""some guy"" (Rhys Ifans) - Uncle Ben tells Peter later that this is Dr. Curt Conners, who was a friend of the Parkers.These family ties are tightly woven threads of the story. Peter Parker is very much Richard Parker's son. But he does enjoy a close relationship with his Aunt and Uncle.Peter finds the compartment in the attach√© case that holds papers with the symbol ""√∏√∏"" and some scientific formula. Looking up Conners on the computer, he sees that an internship program has just started, so he goes to Oscorp and sneaks in. On an escalator, he sees a representation of the shadowy image of Norm Osborn.As it happens, Gwen Stacy is the head intern, but she lets Parker stay. He gets Conner's attention by knowing the answer to a question he asks the interns. But then he bumps in to a man named Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan) and sees that ""√∏√∏"" symbol on a paper he drops. He follows Ratha and finds a room with the same symbols, spiders fall on him from a machine.Gwen Stacy finally kicks him out and this is when he is bitten.From this point in the film, it matches some of the events from Raimi's version - He plays around with his new abilities and in standing up to Flash Thompson, gets into trouble, causing Uncle Ben to be called to Mid-Town Science (The school where Parker went), and phase one of the Uncle Ben ""responsibility"" lecture.After school he goes to see Dr Conners and tells Conners who he is, giving him the formula which he did not know that his father was keeping from Conners and the rest of Oscorp.Missing is the whole ""Wrestling Match for Money"" angle but the story with Uncle Ben is pretty much the same, he is killed by a petty thug, causing Parker to go out vigilante-style. Unlike Maguire, he cannot shoot webs from his fingers, he uses webbing he gets from Oscorp to make the Web- Shooters. Eventually he makes the costume and then goes out hunting some more - THIS is where Andrew Garfield is very good as Spider-Man, he is VERY good with the Spidey-Cracks. ""Hey! I'm Swingin'' Here!""Denis Leary is Captain Stacy, Gwen's dad, who Parker has several confrontations with as both Parker and Spidey: This is an excellent character, especially when Parker starts showing interest in Gwen.Most of this film shows the results of Peter giving the formula to Conners, who uses it to mutate into ""The Lizard"" and how parker as Spider-Man corrects that mistake with Gwen's help, and the ultimate cost. The problem with this film is mostly the Digital Lizard, which although done well, is just too difficult to believe. But Spidey's fights with the creature are a good blend of practical filming and CGI. The Raimi films have too much Digital Spider-Man, most of the Spidey in this one, are really Garfield or whoever is in the costume doing stunts.I liked this more than I expected to, and I was very pleased with the chemistry between ""Parker"" and ""Gwen"" and the way Parker/Spidey admits to Gwen that ""The Lizard"" was his responsibility. The ""Power/Responsibility"" connection was not preached out at us, is was worked into the story on a gut level.","7/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","bypeterfenton","3 August 2022","Did I hate this movie? No, I really didn't. Andrew Garfield is incredibly likable and makes an excellent Spider-Man. But... it just really didn't grab me. The plot was fairly dull on a macro-level and the dialogue within the script was pretty bland. I would've loved to see Andrew Garfield's take as Spider Man with a better script. The visuals were fine (it's a superhero movie) and Sally Field is always fun to see, but not much else really is sticking with me about this film beyond Andrew Garfield's infectiously likable performance. Didn't hate it, but I won't remember it.Also, I have to say-I really couldn't get on board with the school scenes. The single least believable thing in this film (a film including a giant lizard monster and someone getting superpowers from a radioactive spider, mind you) is the fact that someone who looks like Andrew Garfield was a loser in high school. Nope. Kid would've called all the shots in my high school and many others. The man is a demigod and radiates that energy in any role he's in... which makes him hard to buy as a social outcast.","9/10"

I enjoyed Andrew Garfield allot more than Tobey Maguire's performance as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Andrew had the wise crack of Spider-Man because if you read the comics or watch any of the cartoons, you'll see Spider-Man as a wise cracker and as Peter Parker, he has nerdy, but he is more than just a nerd. He was also a teenager who had friends. Emma Stone was a much better romantic lead than Kristen Dunst. And I thought the action was much better than the first Spider-Man.

Even in 2D, I was astounded by the level of detail of the Spiderman swinging through skyscrapers in New York. There are comedic scenes that got the whole house laughing, and there are also spine chilling scenes involving heights. I like the emotional subplot very much too. The emotional connections between Peter and Gwen, and also between Gwen's father and Peter are well portrayed, that the film is moving me to the point of tears.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","milsir-31457","19 January 2022","Of course, it's a banality, but sometimes, in order to move forward, you need to take a step back.After the Avengers, together with alien hordes, defeated the central districts of New York, took part in the disappearance of the ""fabulous"" Sokovia and for sure, not once again, will be seen in many epic battles, the local confrontation between the Vulture gang and Spider-Man could seem faded and of little interest.But the authors of Spider-Man: Homecoming did such a filigree and verified work, having got a recipe for universal content somewhere, filled the picture with events and characters, whose jokes are laughed at and empathized with, not only children and teenagers, but also viewers with experience.Everything worked in the film, or almost everything. Starting with Peter's video blog, with the fact that the viewer is not forced to once again stare at spiders and bite, Uncle Ben and Peter's emotional lamentations and moral dilemmas, they omit a lot that is already well known to everyone, and go straight to the main and much more delicious.Everything looks interesting, as if on the screen there is not a movie about Spider-Man, but a very fresh and original story. The characters are not played, the return home is like a report from that, well, that universe, they are all alive and real. An excellent effect that the authors of the Marvel universe managed to achieve.The idea of a new costume for Spider-Man looks advantageous. In the era of gadgets and smartphones, Peter just needed this kind of costume, as well as a school party, their nerdy circle, which only adds to the picture of advantages.Spider-Man: Homecoming is a bold, modern, not devoid of youthful enthusiasm and creative imagination film. A very strong solo album, for a very green Tom Holland. Excellent work, keep it up.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","alexdelliott","10 July 2012","STORY Well the story is fairly obvious, guy gets bitten by spider....guy becomes Spider-Man. It has been seen. However, its the other subplots and character developments which make this film actually (in my opinion) better than the 2002 film. I felt more attached to the characters like Uncle Ben for example. I won't go into details as I don't give spoilers but it was more emotional, and characters were much more relatable. The only real flaws I thought were the villain who's scenes felt a little rushed and the film didn't dwell on his character enough, and also the fact that Peter just wasn't nerdy enough, although that may be down to casting. 3/5EXECUTION Firstly, I really enjoyed the directing, and with the 3D it did actually look pretty impressive. The camera work was smooth and really made each scene stand out especially the ones that actually showed Spider-Man. The acting was good all round, I think Martin Sheen stole some of the scenes he was in and Rhys Ifans played the part of Dr Connors really well, although he probably was't seen enough as I would have liked. Andrew Garfield is a good actor but I'm just not sure he's right for this role, Spider-Man is meant to be the repressed but sarcastic science geek and that just wasn't carried out well. This is just nit picking though, the film was executed very well in my opinion. 4/5CONCLUSION After being dragged to this film by some mates, it was a nice surprise when it actually turned out to be good. It was slightly more gritty and emotional than the 2002 film whilst staying true to its roots. I'd recommend a watch as its probably worth seeing. At the very least I think people will be glad they saw it. 3/5 + 4/5 = 7/10","7/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","ferguson-6","7 July 2012","Greetings again from the darkness. The big debate seems to be whether it is too soon for the Spider-Man franchise to be re-booted. It was just 10 years ago when Tobey Maguire first appeared as Spidey and a mere 5 years ago when director Sam Raimi delivered the last leg in his trilogy. Obviously the reason to re-boot starts with ""doll"" and ends with ""ars"". It is more interesting to decide if this is an improvement over the previous series.We must first look at Spider-man himself. Played here by Andrew Garfield, we get a more thoughtful Peter Parker and a more athletic Spidey version than we had with Maguire. As usual, my pet peeve is that Garfield is a 28 year old man cast as an 18 year old high school science nerd. Looking past that, Garfield manages to pull off the stunts without looking too much like a real super hero. So that's a plus. Luckily for him, his scenes with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) work because Ms. Stone is such a super talent. She makes everything she is in, just a little bit better.Next we look at the villain. Rhys Ifans plays scientist Dr Curt Connors, who transforms into Lizard in the quest to regenerate growth of his lost right arm. He was once partners with Peter's dad in their research into reptilian genetics. While Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) from Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite villain in the series, it's clear that Lizard is certainly capable of frightening the younger viewers, so parents beware. It should also be noted that Dr Curt Connors was played by Dylan Baker in the Sam Raimi trilogy.Lastly, we look at the story. This take is much more personal and provides detail to the backstory of Peter Parker. We learn how (but not exactly why) he lost his parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) and see how he came to be raised by Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). We see how he and Gwen Stacy come together and learn that she is every bit his equal intellectually, if not a notch above. Casting Dennis Leary as Gwen's Police Chief dad works as Leary and Garfield exchange barbs at the table. Peter is still a photographer, but this time for the school instead of The Daily Bugle ... whose logo makes an appearance on TV.Director Marc Webb was somehow selected for this despite his only feature film being (500) Days of Summer ... not exactly a film known for its CGI. Admittedly, the CGI used here is less rush and cluttered than in previous Spidey films and many of the stunts look to be real stunts instead of the fake stuff. The closing credit cookie clearly sets up the sequel, though I can only guess that the shadowy figure is Norman Osborn. That's still up for debate.","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","SnoopyStyle","17 August 2013","It's a new reboot of Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). This time, the love interest is Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). There is a bit about his parents tying them to Peter's powers.Marc Webb takes over the franchise. It's a surprising move but he does a good job. It's slightly less comical than Sam Raimi. Andrew Garfield is the same age as Tobey Maguire when he started, but Andrew looks much older. It's hard to imagine him as a high school nerd. Andrew looks his age which is 27-28 whereas Tobey always looks like a kid. Andrew really looks like one of the cool art kids with a guitar. Emma Stone is great as the love interest. Rhys Ifans is the villain but the problem is his CG avatar. He's a lizard and doesn't have much personality. Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock are far superior villains than Rhys Ifans. So the franchise continues, but not a total revolution. Just new people. The constant rebooting may wear people out someday.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","GaawiinMashiNinibaasiin","3 July 2012","This movie truly delivers. Great cast, great acting, great story, great action, and most importantly great story telling. It's one of those movies that put you at its mercy. Slowly its invisible web tangles you around and before you know it, you're bound and powerless. You get immersed to the story, to the emotions of the scene. You can't help but to feel what Peter Parker is feeling. His pain, his anger, his joy, his anguish. And you want him to win over the villain. You're relieved when he overcomes obstacles. Then at the end of the movie you enthusiastically clap your hands together to applaud the great performance that you just saw. That's how I felt. I was reluctant to see it at first. The trailers didn't impress me. I've seen previous movies with Tobey Maguire and thought that they're pretty well made. Though I'm not a fan, the fact that they cast a different person to play the role of spider-man this time around was both confusing and appalling to me. Had the ticket not been free, I wouldn't have gone to see it. I came to the theater with no expectation other than that I'd be disappointed. But this movie turned me into a believer. This is the best spider-man movie. Andrew Garfield is Peter Parker. He even sounds like Peter Parker from the cartoon show. His performance was so great it's infectious. He deserves an Oscar notch for this role. Why not? Why can't a movie be entertaining and Oscar worthy at the same time? I'm sure this movie has flaws when you dissect it. And I'm sure it disappoints a lot of spider-man fans in some ways. But sometimes you just have to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. What a great ride it was for me. 10 out of 10.PS. I saw this on 2D.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","connormahone","29 December 2021","I love the passion he has for this character, I love the chemistry with Emma Stone, I love his emotions in this movie, I love his expressions, I love how he manages to act his ass off without having to see his face, and I love the visuals in this film.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","gunn-wrights","5 June 2022","I didn't love it, I didn't hate it. Pretty slow for a Spiderman movie. I wish they'd get it straight: does the web come from his body, or is it an add on he has to wear to create the web? I'm so confused!!Also, IMHO, I don't think the guy the casted was 'right' for Spiderman. Sure, they teased him at school, but he didn't really give off the 'I'm a nerd' vibe. The hottest girl in school already thinks he's cute - and he didn't have to really try. Finally, the worst villain they could come up with is some lizard boy? WHAT?RECOMMENDATION: If it's between mowing the grass in 90 degree weather, and watching this.... it would be a hard decision, but I guess it would be to watch this?","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Califorever1","21 December 2012","I first was going to see another movie, but my cousin wanted to see this. I walk into the movie theater thinking: 'Yeah this'll probably suck and be boring' and came out with chills. I saw this movie in 3D and it felt like I was there with the actors, in all the scenes! Of course the fight scenes were a little bland and they could have added a little more action. But the part when Peter is Spider-man and he was doing flips up in the air, also swinging across buildings, literally gave me an adrenaline rush. It was an amazing feeling.But the best part of this movie wasn't the action, but the chemistry between Peter (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen (Emma Stone). Every time they had a scene together, I could absolutely tell that they were in love. Their love story was one of the best parts of this movie because it blossomed from them being cute and flirty, to being completely head over heels in love with each other. They were both charming but also pulled it off as their character very well; Emma as the intelligent, graceful Gwen, and Andrew as the cute, but awkward and nerdy Peter. They were definitely the highlights of this film.Like every movie, it had it's flaws. I think that they could have chosen a better villain than 'The Lizard'. Don't get me wrong, Rhys Ifans was a good actor in this film but his character just felt rushed to me. One moment I see him as a brilliant, kind-hearted scientist to him then becoming psychotic and turning himself into a giant green monster way too quickly. Also, I didn't think he looked like a lizard at all. Honestly, I think once he turned into 'The Lizard' he looked a lot like 'Lord Voldemort' from 'Harry Potter'. He was the only character I had an issue with though everyone else was great and was perfect for their part.Another issue, that a lot of people complained about was the lack of thrilling fight scenes. The fight scenes in this movie were a little clich√© like you have seen it in another action movie. Also the fight scenes just kind of came and went. They were so quick and just very boring, like you knew every move Spider-Man (AKA Peter) was going to make. I thought they should have put a little more effort into these scenes and they should've put a lot more action into them.Honestly, overall this is a terrific movie! Despite some flaws, I think it is definitely worth seeing. Andrew and Emma are very charming in their parts and look adorable together on-screen. It has some cute lines were I had to laugh out loud because they were just really funny! If you like a super-hero movie with a comedic and romantic twist into it, I think you will enjoy this movie!","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Aman_Goyal","2 April 2019","Andrew Garfield is certainly the best Spider-Man. It looks like he made a fictional character so real. So underrated film. Undoubtedly better than other Spider-Man films. If you don't like it, then you don't deserve it.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","JeffTheBadger","26 June 2012","To start off I want to say I enjoyed this movie¬Ö but even as I type that I do question exactly how much.People have talked about the CGI not being up to scratch and parts of the 3D being blurry but I don't think that was the problem. The action was great, the characters were good but it seemed to be one ""amazing"" set piece scene after another with very little connecting them. I often found myself wondering what happened to get from point A to C, B seems to happen off screen for a large portion of the film.I know the words ""gritty"" and ""dark"" seem to crop up every time someone talks about a good superhero film but I don't think that needs to be the case, I like superhero films to be larger than life ‚Äì that's kind of the point! For the inevitable comparison with the Sam Raimi spiderman film, I would say it is more gritty, a little darker, slightly less fun and a lot less coherent.An overall enjoyable watch but not sure ""amazing"" should have been in the title.","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","kellynmac18","17 July 2012","This was the first ""super hero"" movie I have ever seen in theaters, and let me tell you - Spider Man is my new favorite super hero!

The acting was phenomenal - my friends and I significantly underestimated Andrew Garfield's performance before seeing the movie. I want to see it again and again and again - he is amazing as Peter Parker!!! Emma Stone is amazing as Gwen, and the other actors and actresses will blow you away!! (Martin Sheen was the one that surprised me the most!!!). Love this movie...if I could, I'd give it an 11...a must see!","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","blandiefam","5 July 2012","I paid good money to see this and I was truly disappointed. The acting was superb and the cinematography was better than the Raimi version, but the buck stops there! Sam was a better story teller and you felt you didn't need to know much about the character before watching the movie. This new version lacks the plausibility of the whole story. It seems the director, Webb, wanted to make the unreal more realistic and bring him into our world not realizing that movie goers want to be transported into the world of the fantasy and get a break from ours. Garfield played a brooding web-slinger who was more concerned about finding himself than the killer of his Uncle. I know this movie stayed true to many parts of the comic book, but the character development was lacking and was only compensated by the brilliant actors playing the key roles. Spidey Sense was nowhere in this, his ability to heal quickly, and his reporter angles were also omitted. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that all of New York knew he was Spiderman. All except for Aunt May. I must say that no matter how old Sally Field gets she is still too sexy to play Aunt May. The wrestling angle and the slaying of Uncle Ben were too rushed in my opinion. Lizard seemed too powerful to be foiled by the weaker watered down version of Spiderman. Maybe Mr. Webb believed he was more qualified than anyone else because of his name. Even the explanation of how he got bitten was never properly explored. Garfield has a James Dean like quality in his acting and you felt as if you were more comfortable watching PP outside of the costume because Spiderman's identity was never truly developed. I would recommend watching the first two Raimi Spiderman movies than this watered down hapless version. The ending left you dissatisfied as if you were given a Whopper without any meat.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","aaronjbong","3 July 2012","Who doesn't know Spider-Man, especially when a trilogy of films based on the superhero started a little over ten years ago? All three films have been tremendous successes and have become movie phenomenons. Sadly, the third film was a mess, filled with too many villains and disastrous subplots. So to make things easier, they went for the 'reboot' route with Marc Webb replacing Sam Raimi, Andrew Garfield taking over Tobey Maguire, and Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy replacing Kirsten Dunst's MJ. Luckily, they did a great job of it.The story of Peter Parker's origins in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not necessarily the ""Untold Story"" as the advertisements say but rather a revamped version. It goes back to basics, taking the key plot points of the original ""Spider-Man"" film and putting it all together with a few more details and finishing touches. Peter Parker, an orphan living with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, is in high school. He's nerdy and sort of unsociable. He has a hobby in photography although his true passion lies in Science. In an attempt to discover his father's secret life, and of course due to curiosity and stubbornness, he gets bitten by a modified spider and gains his superpowers. His superpowers however don't include being able to shoot webs out of his hands as now he uses mechanical devices to shoot out the webs.Those who watched the 2002 original blockbuster may feel over-familiar with the first hour of the film as it stays very similar with it. Even Uncle Ben's death is present here, albeit killed by a different person. However, I must say that the origin story is done perfectly and more enjoyable than the one provided in the first film. It's more detailed and his parents, especially his father, is more involved here. It's also surprisingly more touching, and more emotional.Here, the villain is someone who hasn't appeared in any of the previous films. It's no other than the Lizard. Apparently the Lizard is the result of an experiment done by Dr. Curt Connors, who is the working partner of Peter's dad, Richard Parker. Both of them have been working on cross-species genetics planning to cure others. Unfortunately, Richard died in a plane crash along with his wife resulting in Peter becoming an orphan. Connors has also lost his right arm in an incident and has been observing the regenerative abilities of reptiles (particularly the lizard) in an attempt to grow his right arm back. With the help of Peter Parker, he successfully creates the serum and it worked. However, it does just more than that, the serum completely changes him and turns him into a monster named The Lizard, now equipped with superhuman strength and abilities.Gwen Stacy's is Spider-Man's main love interest here. Unlike MJ, she is also interested in Science, not someone into singing or anything like that. In fact, she is like the assistant of Dr. Connors and works in Oscorp. Even though she loves Peter Parker and knows of his secret identity, her father is apparently Captain George Stacy and Captain in the Police Department and has issued an arrest warrant for Spider-Man. So much trouble. This creates a stronger romance for the film and is definitely another triumph over the original Spider-Man.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" offers very powerful performances by the actors. Andrew Garfield gave a great performance as the newly revamped Spider-Man. However, I thought that he would be unsuitable as he would look like someone you don't want to mess with and hardly a nerd. But that all changed when I saw this film. He successfully gave Peter the teenage personality needed and was stunning. Emma Stone also gave a great performance as Gwen Stacy and the chemistry between the two leads were convincing. Rhys Ifans gave a cruel and menacing portrayal of Dr. Curt Connors and also did a great job.The reboot also had impressive 3D effects and one of the few films that uses the 3D wisely. The sets more realistic and envelops you into the action. Talking about action, the battles here are also very exciting and creates high levels of suspense. However, I thought that some of the action sequences are less creative than others and therefore not consistent. The battle in the bridge was satisfying whereas the battle in the school was less creative although it incorporated a very humorous scene. Just when you thought Spider-Man was becoming ""Batman Begins"" and descending into darkness, it instead became an action film filled with lots of humor too. There are many comedic scenes that make the film fun and not too depressing. The most humorous scene was actually the one with the signature Stan Lee cameo, the creator himself. This is by far the best Stan cameo I've ever seen and was very hilarious.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is amazing indeed. It has great acting, impressive 3D effects, and a detailed familiar plot. The two things that downed this film was probably that familiar feeling of the plot which makes it less intriguing (especially when the original film just came out a little over ten years ago), and the less creative battles in the movie. However, the former can be repaired by the more detailed additional plot points and polishes to the origin story. Otherwise, I enjoyed the film immensely. It had a great villain, fun comedic moments, exciting action sequences, and a strong love subplot. I would say that this reboot is probably better than the original, far better than the third, and on par with the second. And watch for that one scene after the credits start rolling. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" offers viewers an excellent reboot to one of the greatest Marvel franchises ever, thanks to Andrew Garfield's excellent performance, and director Marc Webb who has polished the origin story and crafted an action-packed, emotional, and funny superhero film.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","psionchronicles","30 July 2012","Rating this movie comes down to a value judgment. If you are an aficionado of the silver age comic books, it may leave you wanting. Significant liberties were taken with the characters and their story lines to create a Spider-Man that today's kids may relate to more, as well as to improve the believability overall. Is Andrew Garfield the Peter Parker we grew up with? Hardly. But he's a Peter Parker that makes sense in 2012. The original Peter Parker was better played by Toby Maguire--straight-edge to the point of sickening, always worrying about his Aunt May getting upset. This Peter Parker, like a typical teen, wants as little to do with ""'rent"" figures as possible. Gwen Stacy has been updated as well; her demeanor is more like that of a 30-year-old than a teen in the beginning, then she deteriorates into a love object straight out of any teen exploitation television series. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are good choices for their roles, but again, you need to be ready for major storyline alterations. It is as if the writer and director went out of their ways to change things for the sake of changing them.My chief complaint about the movie is the CGI. CGI is like makeup on a woman: it should only be used by someone who knows what they are doing, and usually less is more. As many years as Hollywood has been using it, very little progress has been made in making organic things look realistic; the technology so far lends itself much better to machinery and starships than to living things. The Lizard looks like a setback to the original Shrek animation--clumsy and cartoonish. Even the Geico gecko is more convincing. Hopefully in my lifetime, they will perfect the movement techniques to the point where most CGI looks real and not like a FPS game.To be fair, if they were going to reboot a franchise, they couldn't just repackage old ideas. The movie is watchable, regardless of your background. But a sequel to it probably wouldn't be. I shudder to think what this crew would do to the Green Goblin.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","MattyGibbs","31 March 2013","I am not a fan of super hero movies and watched this only because my kids wanted to watch it. The cast was top rate. I thought Andrew Garfield was pretty impressive as Peter Parker and made a better Spider-man than Tobey Maguire. Emma Stone is a fantastic actress and always worth watching and adds charm as Gwen Stacy. Martin Sheen was as good as ever and Rhys Ifans makes for a pretty good villain. The film was beautifully shot and the set pieces where Peter Parker discovers his powers were amusing and well filmed. The action sequences throughout the film were exciting and well executed.This is an old fashioned and uncomplicated telling of the tale and much the better for it. This to my mind is the finest Superhero film made and certainly much better than the recent Dark Knight films.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","mukherjee38","20 March 2013","This movie was utterly fantastic ! I seriously loved it, ignore all the haters, these people just can't get over the fact that This film was superior to Spider-Man 2002. It is a 'realistic', contemporary and a grounded approach onto the Character by the Director Marc Webb, yet staying faithful to its source materials( combo of The Amazing and The Ultimate Story lines). Of course, there are a couple of plot holes, but I am sure they'll be explained in the upcoming Sequel. I Must say that Andrew Garfield brought justice to the role of Spider-Man. An absolutely amazing and a highly gripping movie. I highly refer it to any True Spider-Man Fan, as the people who have never read the comics might call it a 'rehash' of the First Spiderman movie, but actually, this movie stayed fairly true to the comics from the beginning to the end. 9/10 stars from Me !

The villain comes, he threatens spider-mans girlfriend, they fight for a bit, and the villain kills himself. the movies rush any accuracy it was going for like making him spider-man after he graduates and giving him Mary Jane before Gwen, and don't get me started with the green goblin. making him the goblin before you show the power hungry business man what where they thinking? But when i saw this film i cloud have never been this happy since the dark knight, its not better than the dark knight or its equal, but just as the dark knight finally made a batman film I've been waiting for, the amazing spider-man did the same with spider-man, it made some changes necessary for it to be a movie while keeping true to its source material its the Peter Parker I've been waiting for, its the girlfriend I've been waiting for and hes funny hes smart his body looks like a spider rather than a sumo wrestler and the bad guy is serious, and the ending fight is different like when Parker warns his girlfriend that the lizard is coming instead of being kidnapped she helps people and uses a blow torch to fight him off, and the side characters are developed not so many throw away characters, so yeah i love this movie i want to see where they take it next.","10/10"

This movie serves justice to the MCU comics and the roll of clumsy yet smart Peter Parker, which is something i think lacks in the new movies with Tom Holland. Also the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is insane , more mature and raw than in the new marvel adaptation, without mentioning this movie has just the right amount of comedic aspect which adds points in things I didn't like about the new MCU adaptation with Tom Holland, like I felt I was watching a Comedy for the whole ass movie and I'm not saying is bad to have comedy but the whole movie just felt like satire.Don't get me wrong it's not like I don't like the new MCU adaptation and I love Tom Holland but this one is just more related to the comic and overall better.","5/10"

Emma Stone was also a wonderful, important part of the movie. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors was absolutely brilliant and his transformations as the lizards could not be any more creepy! Marc Webb owned Spider-Man with the fight sequences and web slinging. The best Stan Lee cameo of all time. Webbs version was overall way better than Raimi's depiction!

I almost walked out about midway but I wanted to give it a chance. The lizard man looked really lame also. One thing I hate when I am watching a movie is the characters motivation, why is he/she doing this or that? I should not be asking myself ""why is this character doing that"". I am also really sick and tired of nearly 30 year old actors playing 16 year olds! Spoiler alert!! I though Spiderman was in college, he is playing a high school kid? I loved some of the actors in this movie but I did not like them in this. The action was bad, I kept thinking to myself, isn't this the same thing we saw in the other spiderman movies?

Like everyone I'm appalled by the lack of respect for Sam Raimi and for the original comics. I'll admit Spider-man 3 was a mess, but this was the fault of the studio- execs and not of master Raimi...

"The Amazing Spider-Man","TheLittleSongbird","28 July 2014","That said though, from personal opinion The Amazing Spider-Man was not a bad film, or at least nowhere near as bad as has been said(again personal opinion), but it doesn't live up to its name. For me, the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man films are better, and while Spider-Man did plod and had too many villains all but one of which were underused personally it wasn't that bad. The Amazing Spider-Man did have things to like, it is very stylishly made and has some very impressive special effects, even if the Lizard takes some getting used to. The action sequences- of which there are a lot in the second half- mostly are exciting with some cool stunts(the one exception is the climax which seemed like it was played and written too safe) and very creative use of Spider-Man's powers, and there are some parts in the story that work, the dynamic between Peter and Uncle Ben is really quite emotionally powerful, the romance between Peter and Gwen is somewhat sweet and the part where Spider-Man saves the little boy is tense and heart-felt. It was also very intriguing with the mystery of Peter's parents which was done quite well. The performances on the whole are also good, Sally Field and especially Martin Sheen are great as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and Emma Stone is a charming and amusing Gwen. Rhys Ifans does bring some creepiness to Curt Connors/The Lizard if not the tragedy(the writing didn't help him though) and Denis Leary is delightful in how churlish he is. On the whole too there is some good chemistry between the actors. I never really warmed to Andrew Garfield though, he did seem too quirky for Peter complete with some forced humour and wasn't enough of a nerd, he wasn't a whole lot better as Spider-Man either, he had charisma but did come across as rather smug and not brooding enough for such a serious tone to the story here. Irrfan Kahn's performance and his character is little more than an extended cameo, not very much to work with and Kahn does little with it. The story does have its fair share of well-done moments but does suffer from an over-familiarity that feels like a more seriously toned rehash and uneven pacing, sluggish in the first half and while much better rushed in some of the second half. The script is never terrible nor is it ever exceptional, there are sweet and emotional moments as well as tense ones but too much of the humour is forced and it interferes with the serious tone. James Horner's score is nowhere near among his best, some of it pedestrian, some of it over-the-top, neither of which Danny Elfman's scoring had. And the film really rushed Connors'/Lizard's character arc, there was real potential for him to be a multi-layered character but here he came across as a one-dimensional villain with no real motivation. Overall, watchable but not close to being amazing. 5.5/10 Bethany Cox","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","ladymoonpictures","5 July 2012","Nothing But a Remake - NBAR! Maybe it was just me, but since the First Spider Man was still modern; still relevant, on the heels of Toby Macguire and Cliff Robertson, WHY did we have to make the same ol thing over again? What: To see if there was an upside down kiss? C'mon! I expected more. The spoilers are...wait! Only everything you saw in the last one! That's all. The kid gets bit on the back by a spider, albeit digital one; Kid meets girl - falls for girl; Uncle gets shot dead; etc., etc. Couldn't they come up with some creative ideas, enough to write a new flippin' story? Like after several Batman movies, we were treated and rewarded with ""Batman Begins""! as a great example. This spider movie version, because of the disappointment of watching the same old plot lines, makes this nothing but a quick spin, with a few new faces and a few changes with story and villain -- this ends up being nothing but a 'cash cow' for the production executives and all y'all have fallen right into their trap. Yes, true. Me too...except I got in free.","4/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","christopher-thomas933","6 July 2012","Right i'd like to get into this by first saying that I've never wrote a movie review in my life, but as a lifetime comic book fan and collector i was the first person to say ""ah no can't believe they are doing a reboot!"" ""What was wrong with the last trilogy?"" blah blah.Don't get me wrong when i was a nipper i watched Nicholas Hammond with one web shooter, winch cables, (all be it on a side of a skyscraper!) camp bad guys ( no Batman! How that ever recovered!!!) and terrible fx and i loved it i think i burned out the VHS tape because it was that good. (i was 6!) Then i saw the Rami/Toby movie and loved it but it lacked something. Like Spiderman wasn't Spiderman. The running down the street pulling the shirt open was a little Superman but it worked. Mary Jane? Well if your on the track of Ultimate Spiderman yeah cool. But we're notRami had a vision if he threw the Spiderman humour in there then this movie couldn't touch it but he didn't. No fault of his own. Spiderman 2 had that bank scene it had comedy it was how Spiderman works. Irritating, annoying getting the bad guy frustrated, brilliant! But i think i got my expectations a little high because Spiderman 3 came out and Spiderman/Toby became irritating, annoying, crying baby! I mean come on man up your Spiderman!! I'm not gonna talk about the rest because it was poppycock really. Youtube ""how it should have ended and you'll agree"".Now The Amazing Spiderman. Where shall i start. Cast Awesome! Emma Stone Gwen Stacey? Have you seen the comic book back in the 60's? she looks the same almost spit image, and she was Peter Parkers first love interest way before Mary Jane came along. Rhys Ifans was powerful and this is a guy who does a lot of B movies (Twin Town, Mr Nice) We haven't got to talk about Aunt May and Uncle Ben because they are obviously well established. It makes me laugh the people who say the cast was week! Come on! Get a grip! Its dark its got web shooters, backstory( which was probably open because it can be continued in the sequel. Some numpty said in an earlier review ""the high school doesn't look like it was set in New York!"" my question to his is There is a reason its called ""Middletown"" high school, and if you read Ultimate Spiderman you'll know its set in a suburb of Queens ya dick!","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Chris_Pandolfi","3 July 2012","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" will inevitably be compared to and perhaps even attacked by die-hard adherents of Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, most prominently the original 2002 film. True enough, this reboot directed by Marc Webb is pretty much telling the exact same story: A high school science geek with no parents is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, is slightly mutated in the process, and ultimately becomes a masked vigilante that shoots webs from his wrists and swings over and around the skyscrapers of New York City. My fear is that audiences will be so wrapped up in noticing the similarities that they will fail to see all the ways in which this version is different. Yes, there are the technical details ‚Äì plot, character, setting, casting, etc. ‚Äì but it has more to do with atmosphere and style than anything else.Raimi's approach was much more escapist, loading the story with action, special effects, and a great deal of humor. There was nothing particularly heavy about it; it was made with the sole intention of being entertaining, and so it was. By contrast, Webb's approach is more introspective and symbolic. The plot is a bit less straightforward, the tone is a little darker, the characters are easier to invest in emotionally, the humor is subtler, and there's less action choreography to gawk at helplessly. Having said all that, never once does Webb lose sight of the fact that his movie is based on a comic book. The slick special effects, the over-the-top fight sequences, the preposterous plot, the now-mandatory cameo appearance by Stan Lee, and even its presentation in 3D ensure that a fun time will be had by all.What really surprised me is that this film is a triumph of casting. Andrew Garfield takes the reins from Tobey Maguire in the role of Peter Parker, who's once again a high school kid and whose genesis into Spider-Man is reexamined. I initially didn't think I would be convinced, given the fact that Garfield is in his late twenties. How wrong I was. Apart from the fact that he still believably looks seventeen years old, he accurately evokes youthful thoughts and behaviors, like riding a skateboard, occasionally being defiant of authority, and making rash decisions without completely thinking them through. Flashback sequences reveal that Parker's parents were forced to go into hiding after his father's office was unsuccessfully ransacked for an elusive research folder; raised by his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), part of the plot involves Parker accessing his father's research files in the hopes of understanding the reason for his disappearance.Parker's classmate and love interest has changed from Mary Jane Watson to Gwen Stacy. She's played by Emma Stone, who somehow has gotten more magnetic with each new role she accepts. Gwen learns fairly early on that Parker is the masked vigilante Spider-Man, who has taken to the streets on a dangerous quest to find the man who murdered Uncle Ben in cold blood; she finds herself torn between Parker and her father, George Stacy (Denis Leary), a perpetually suspicious NYPD Captain who's out to arrest Spider-Man, believing him to be more of a menace than a hero. Like Parker, Gwen has a passion for science and currently serves as an intern for a one-armed scientist named Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who's being pressured by his superior (Irrfan Khan) to devise a cure for the unseen but apparently dying head of his corporation.As it so happens, Connors once worked with Parker's father, their research involving genetic splicing and the regeneration of limbs. It was all, according to Connors, in the name of putting an end to weakness, of allowing humanity a chance to improve. But then he uses himself as a guinea pig for a serum containing reptile DNA; although he does successfully grow a new right arm, he also mutates into a gigantic lizard creature and develops a superiority complex. Humanity, he eventually reasons, cannot be improved and should therefore be eliminated ‚Äì or, in true comic book fashion, genetically transformed. It's up to Parker to convince Captain Stacy that his target should be Dr. Connors and not Spider-Man. In the meantime, Parker and Gwen must stop Connors before it's too late.As well-crafted as all the scenes were, three in particular stand out as the film's best. One is an action sequence in which Parker, dressed as Spider-Man, has to save a child from a car dangling perilously off a bridge. Another is a quieter moment in which we see the redemption of the school bully, Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka). The last is an incredibly sweet moment between Parker, Aunt May, one that involves a carton of eggs. Are these scenes consistent with the original comic book? How about with Sam Raimi's 2002 film? To be perfectly honest, I believe a debate over which version is ""better"" is utterly pointless. I think of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" as I would a fairy tale; it's not about the originality of the story so much as the differences in technique and interpretation.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","mjplysaght","10 July 2017","So after the mixed reviews of Spider-Man 3 and the aborted plans for Spider-Man 4, Sony decided to reboot the franchise with a new cast, new director and a 'new' story thread.Peter Parker is now played by Andrew Garfield, who is a decent actor but his portrayal as Spider-Man is kinda questionable. Once again, he is too old to pull off the illusion that he's still in high school. Also, the classic archetype of Peter Parker pre-spider bite is that he's a reclusive nerdy brainbox. This iteration of Parker takes a different turn, as Garfield plays the part as a hipster wannabe who is already handsome and charismatic.His love interest is Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone. Their chemistry is perfect together but Gwen's input to the plot is fairly minimal, other than her father being the Chief of Police, played by Denis Leary. Gwen finds out that Parker is Spider-Man and tries to keep the fact hidden from her father, who is out to foil him for vigilantism.So the promotional marketing tried to pass off this movie as the 'untold story' of Spider-Man, which turns out to be a complete lie as the origin story of Spider-Man is rehashed with the only different being a loose thread as to how Parker's parents passed away.Uncle Ben is now played by Martin Sheen who *spoiler alert* dies. Big shock. Parker tries to track down and confront his uncle's killer. Or at least 10-20 minutes of the film focus on his efforts to find the killer, but then that subplot is completely aborted and never referenced again. Instead, we get thrown into a hastily thrown together villain story about Curt Connors/The Lizard, a work partner of Parker's dad, played by Rhys Ifans.The motivation of the Lizard is an unfocused mess. An Oscorp professor with only one arm, specializing in cross species genetics, he gets his hands on an incomplete algorithm from Parker, based off his father's research, in which he tries to use lizard DNA to regenerate his lost limb. Things go horribly wrong when he mutates into the Lizard and then all of a sudden, he goes on a mad rampage attempting to infect the city of New York with the airborne lizard gas and turn everyone into lizard creatures.I gave this film a pass when I first saw it, thinking nothing of it, but in retrospect, it's kind of a mess. Parker's rarely likable, we've seen the 'story' before and there's hardly anything memorable. The only thing I bought into was the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Other than that, this film is a solid 'meh' for the entirety.","2/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","trans_mauro","20 October 2012","It seems that we live in the era of useless remakes...And these remakes are a clear demonstration of the total lack of creativity and originality that has been plagued major (more expensive) cinematographic endeavors. They cannot come up with any interesting characters and stories, and to play safe they insist on remaking (poorly by the way)film after film.Why another Spiderman? Aren't there tons of superheroes that are as or more interesting than Spiderman? Why the same old story where uncles, friend, etc. die? These guys are clearly betting (and winning) on the dumbing-down of the average movie-goer. All they need is to come up with some decent CGI, 3D effects and a watered-down story to satisfy the masses.In an era when Prometheus is considered a masterpiece (sic) by some, Spiderman (1, 2, 3,...3578) will certainly find an eager audience.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Chalice_Of_Evil","1 July 2012","I was never fussed on the Raimi films, as I felt they were way too cheesy and dated. Gone are the irritating narration, cheesy moments/dialogue, costumes that look like they've been purchased at a toy shop and villains foolishly killing themselves. In their place we have a real human story with moments/dialogue that feel natural, a Spider-Man costume that actually looks like Peter could've made it (instead of some professional designer) and a more nuanced villain.While Tobey Maguire played a stereotypical 'teenager' who was obsessed with MJ and got over-emotional all the time, Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker feels much more 'real'. People over-exaggerate his being 'angstiness' (why they got so hung up on him carrying/using a skateboard I'll never know), but he's actually far more believable as a person. His arguments with Martin Sheen's Uncle Ben (who isn't just there to deliver platitudes/utter his 'famous' responsibility line) feel true to life and there's much more depth there.Also given far more depth in this film is the female lead, Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone (who just in this one film feels like a more fully-developed/well-rounded character than Kirsten Dunst's MJ ever was over the course of three films). She's much more than just a 'love interest', displaying intelligence, kindness, wit, strength and understanding. It's so refreshing to see Gwen be someone who catches onto how Peter's feeling and is smart enough to realise at the end that him attempting to stay away from her was not by choice. She *doesn't* hold it against him and is far more mature a person than MJ.Garfield and Stone's chemistry is off-the-charts and that's why their characters' relationship in this movie not only works, but is integral to the story. Some may dismiss it as 'love story rubbish', but it actually adds more 'humanity' to the film (whereas the Peter/MJ relationship was more just about him being into her while she was into every guy BUT him and treating him badly). These two are far more 'equal' in their relationship. Another interesting relationship is that of Gwen's father, Captain Stacy, and how he interacts with Peter/Spider-Man. They don't see eye-to-eye on a lot, but when it really counts, he proves an ally to Peter (while the father/daughter relationship ensures that he actually feels like a character who *matters* in the story).Rhys Ifans' one-armed Dr. Curt Connors proves villains can be more than just people who've lost their minds or have robotic arms controlling them. He's someone who starts out genuinely wanting to help people, but due to forces beyond his control, his pursuit of this leads him down a dark path. Still, his mentor/student relationship with Peter adds some much-needed complexity. I feel people were overly harsh with the criticism of the Lizard effects. Was it really any worse than Green Goblin's Power Rangers costume? At least Ifans' performance can be see through the CGI.Other characters such as Aunt May and Flash Thompson aren't given that much screentime, but in the case of the former, Sally Field makes the most of her screentime (and isn't just there to tell Peter boring stories), while the latter is fleshed out beyond simply being the 'school bully'. Peter's parents are given focus at the start of the film, playing an important role (his father especially). I appreciated the 'realness' of Peter's interaction with his uncle and aunt, as there was less cheesiness/corniness and more believability between them. About the only superfluous character was Irrfan Khan's Rajit Ratha, whose sole purpose seemed to be as the catalyst for Connors' self-experimentation.What I found particularly effective was Uncle Ben's fate. As one expects, his last exchange with Peter is heated, but here there are no final words between them before his passing. It's much more tragic and Garfield does an exceptional job with conveying not only Peter's emotion in the scene, but his guilt afterwards/how it affects him for the remainder of the film. I also liked the movie making a point of showing Peter being an inventor (no organic web-shooters this time!), as he displays his brilliance on multiple occasions, but naturally with brilliance comes cockiness and although some people found his Spider-Man 'annoying', I was thoroughly entertained by his quips and felt he never verged into 'unlikeable' territory.I could never enjoy the majority of the swinging/action scenes in the Raimi films as I always thought they looked terribly fake (especially the swinging). A CGI man flying/flipping everywhere didn't interest me, but here the effects used to bring Spider-Man in his full glory to life are far more impressive/real-looking. There's weight to him and he doesn't just feel like a cartoon. I also loved the look of this film, as it's wasn't afraid to utilise shadows/darkness, giving it a real moody atmosphere (there were even some 'horror movie'-type moments). The film's theme and music in general might be a bit too subtle for others to appreciate, but I found it effective. It doesn't beat you over the head. Also showing considerable restraint was the use of civilian characters in the film, who don't come across as corny, but in fact act like real people who treat Spider-Man as he deserves to be treated/don't turn on him at the drop of a hat.Naturally, there'll be those who cling to the Raimi films, refusing to accept any other version. Stick with those if you prefer the cheese, but I'm someone who wanted a more 'grounded' feel to the character and his setting, which is what this film gave me and why I vastly prefer it to the first big screen iteration. This one takes its time/doesn't rush to getting Peter in the suit and leaves room for things to breathe/feels like a more mature film to what came before, which is why I enjoy it so much. It's a shame this film is so underappreciated/receives unwarranted hate, as I think it deserves much more appreciation. For me, it remains the 'definitive' Spider-Man film.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","gradyharp","27 November 2012","Why we needed another Spiderman series after the recent (2002/2007) Tobey McGuire run is probably the same reason we keep getting remakes of foreign films (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc): they make money. And it looks like the public will never tire of Marvel Comic Book stories, so might as well settle in and give them a try. It is an evening's entertainment approaching 3 hours of visual shenanigans that are pretty entertaining.There are some differences between this Spiderman and the last - aside from cast: the stories are different although they both claim to show the origin of this magic transformation of a lonely confused young man trying to figure out who he is until he discovers some super secrets and the power to change into a humanoid spider-gifted hero. It all starts out well enough - Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is shy and unable to relate to about everyone except his aunt and uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen do a fine job here). He fails at a run-in with the high school bully Flash (a hunky and promising Chris Zylka), is noticed by the perky Gwen (Emma Stone) who is involved in Peter's introduction to scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who is an old friend of Peter's strangely disappeared father (Campbell Scott) and mother (Embeth Davidtz). Peter is smart, discovers a formula in his father's briefcase, and ultimately is able to transform himself into Spiderman - his nemesis being The Lizard who is actually Dr. Connors taking a potent experimental solution. After a lot of flying around on buildings and throwing spider web tendrils at everything including The Lizard, Peter is hunted as a threat until Gwen's policeman father (Denis Leary) eventually bonds with the insecure Peter in a life saving situation. Then we are given footage of what is up for the sequel...The human (read 'credible') parts work the best - Garfield and Stone make a fine pair and Sheen and Field give fine cameos. Once the transformation takes place the film becomes a lesson in special effects and that is fun enough to watch. It just goes on far too long...and there is more to come. Makes you wonder when the next cycle of Spiderman will come along. Grady Harp","6/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Balzer13","4 July 2012","When I saw the trailer I thought it looked like a C grade movie - ya know not too amazing but not terrible. Then I read the reviews which painted it more of a B grade due to the good acting etc. Just saw it last night and I'd say it's closer to D grade. Other than some real chemistry by the two leads and nice nuanced moments, the film was clearly developed and created by Sony executives rather than the writers or the previously very talented director. Marc Webb's 500 Days of Summer was the Amazing movie on his resume, not this horribly realized and surprisingly boring film. Nothing in it worked: not the set pieces where the action itself was very choppy and confusing and worst of all, not engaging or thrilling. My guess is that Sony needed a hit desperately, felt they had the secret to a successful movie learned from the other 3 Spiderman's, and felt they could push around the writers and the action-inexperienced director and what came out was this very poorly realized film on every level. On the one hand I want it to do well because I think the director is very talented and I want him to have enough success to show us how amazing he can really be on future movies, on the other hand, I'm hoping it under performs and forces all would be controlling movie executives to let good writers and directors do their best work and make good movie instead of subjecting us to a Frankenstein's monster of a film like The Amazing Spiderman.","2/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","kgprophet","7 July 2012","I don't have any childhood attachment to Spiderman like most other people do. I was more a Superman person. When the Sam Raimi version of ""Spiderman"" came out, it was a fresh take and felt it was ""what a Superhero movie should be"". It was not all bluster, and Tobey Maguire had an alluring charm. On the other hand, there was always the moment where everyone could tell we were no longer watching live action, and essentially switched over to watching a Spiderman cartoon. It didn't hurt the quality of the film, I knew from Sam Raimi and composer Danny Elfman's soundtrack work that it was in good hands. That was until Spiderman 3 (see my review). Spiderman 3 did for me what ""Batman & Robin"" did for that franchise. Wisely, the studio put Batman back on the shelf in 1997. The origin story for the Batman franchise was presented in the first film in 1989, SIXTEEN YEARS before the complete reboot and retelling of the origin story in 2005. Here, Sony (watch for Sony product placement in TASM), within just 5 years, is rebooting and is shoving the same familiar origin story last seen just 10 years ago. 16 years is almost a generation between reboots. 10 years for Spiderman is too soon. I have been watching 'modern' superhero movies for the last 12 years (starting with the first ""X-Men""), and there have been some truly great inspirational releases over that time. But there are so many superhero movies out there, and they all have the same clich√©s now. It is the same generic formula over and over: 1. Innocent Boy 'A' wants to date Innocent Daughter 'B' of Successful Father 'C'. 2. 'A' finds secret power. 3. 'A's father 'D' dies, causing 'A' mental anguish. 4. Scientist 'X' becomes Designated Super Villain 'Y'. 5. 'A' becomes superhero 'Z', both loved and hated. 6. 'Z' Threatens 'B', causes panic in Gothametropolis. 7. 'A' is in mental tug-of-war whether to fight crime or marry 'B'.And so on.. However in this unnecessary Spiderman reboot, the generic formula is worse¬Ö'D' is also 'X' while 'C' hates 'A' and 'B' knows about 'Z'. I am becoming burned out on the traditional super hero films. No, this reboot is not ""Batman Begins"" just because they put in the Hans Zimmer WWWHHHHOMMMPPP music stings and busy strings in the soundtrack. Maybe they thought this would feel more authentic by adding a lot of old furniture in the movie. They also tried to add authenticity by casting genuine Academy-caliber actors as the aunt (Sally Field) and uncle (Martin Sheen). But as the movie began telling the origin story again, wasting too much time setting up sequel bait, I began to groan almost right away. Andrew Garfield is the new Tobey Maguire, and yes he is a likable boy/man (he looks like a college student going to a high school). His character is not quite the same Peter Parker. Now he is jumpy and has better agility before his transformation. Garfield's charisma wins you over, thankfully, because having to sit through the same story plot points was starting to give me restless leg syndrome. I have been a veteran movie-goer for over 40 years, and I just can't get into clich√© teenage romance stories these days. At least the original Spiderman set Peter in college, and a far more interesting life. Scenes of skateboarding and high school socializing are meant to connect with the young crowd, but they feel clunky and clich√© nonetheless. I know this is a big 220 million dollar film, so I was impatient for the movie to get to the big action scenes. The movie finally gets you there, and the effects are clearly better than the original ""Spiderman"" for the most part, but that is to be expected over the course of 10 years. They are well done and are exciting, but are relatively straightforward. The villain for this film is a lizardman, who looks menacing enough, but is not a Super Villain by any stretch of the imagination. Any member of the audience who saw ""The Avengers"" earlier in the summer will get a sense of deja-vu, as the Stark tower appears, almost identical, in this film as the centerpiece of the big final action scene. There is a desperate attempt to incorporate a number of skycranes as part of the big finale that makes no sense whatsoever, and provides very little payoff anyway. I was waiting over two hours for this? Yet another fight on top of yet another skyscraper? Been there, done that, way too many times. I will still recommend the film for the action scenes and the ability of Garfield to carry the film. But it is not as good as Raimi's interpretation , especially ""Spiderman 2"".","10/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","invaderJim","13 July 2012","It has truly come to the point where movies are no longer movies, only tools for making money. The ""Amazing"" Spider-Man is a perfect example. Leaving aside the problems in adapting the characters and stories for a transition in medium from comics to film, the movie simply doesn't work as anything but a marketing campaign. The makers of the film are clearly depending upon the viewing population's willingness to go see the sequel (already in progress), if not multiple sequels, in order to see a real story unfold. Any story that the movie does present is developed through abrupt and sloppy plot transitions, and so much is packed into the available 135 minutes that even a lifelong comic fan will leave the theater wondering who the characters were. The swinging effects were amazing, but of course, if you add money somewhere you must subtract it from somewhere else, and the effects for the Lizard were mediocre at best. My advice is to save this movie for Bad Blockbuster night on the couch, once it hits the redbox.","9/10"

Why not, that was art is about.I liked Andy Garfield in the Social Network, I liked his acting in Never Let Me Go and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.Okay, so I'm ready to be entertained, in 3D no less.I really liked the beginning of the film, it was well-made, well-scripted, well-paced, well-acted.Although little Peter reminded me of little Bruce, the story was different enough because his parents left him without an explanation.What I found surprising was that it was incredibly parallel to Spider- Man 2002 in many regards - I didn't mind that, but it made it very predictable...I had thought they would go down a different road, but no...this is really a re-boot, Spider-Man Begins Again (while soon Batman Ends...;-))I liked the high tech lab (not how he got in there, lol!), I liked the subway scene, that was funny.Gwen is into nerds, okay, whatever...I think the film began to lose me when Spidey had 'fun' with the car thief. I did not find that funny at all, his anger, supposedly rooting in his uncle's death (and that's me surmising it, it does not get explained...) is unbelievable.Then comes the action part, character time over.Unconvincing villain, bad CGI lizard, all very uninteresting.At the end, when I was hungry and bored and just wanted it to end, they go back to a bit of character plot, but I didn't care, I was not involved anymore.It seems so many things were just there to get taken up in sequels...Didn't he want to know what happened to his parents? He got sidetracked so easily.I thought maybe they'd explain how he can control when his fingers are sticky and when they aren't (and how are they sticky through his suit??) Why does a wound in his leg affect his abilities? Are his powers affected by the antidote? Oh nevermind, I don't really care...Imo, the scriptwriter, director and the editor did not create an entertaining whole, the music was strange at times or just annoying at others.What I DID like was the acting in the first part (the believable awkward teenager) and all the classic Spidey poses - loved those! Apart from that, 3D did not add a lot, the flying sequences, while elaborate, did not create a feeling of elation nor were they integrated well enough into the story.So now what I feel like is watching Spider-Man again :-).I was ready for a ride, but just got a bit of good drama at the beginning and a lot of boring action after that. I think I'd rather watch Transformers again...;-)7 stars is actually a bit too high, as I was not entertained throughout, but what the heck, they don't do 6.5...Just my two cents.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","valdoherty84","25 June 2012","I know some of the reviews of this movie so far have been hit and miss, but I personally thought this was an excellent film.I saw one of the pre-release screenings and went in without great expectation as I loved the first Tobey Maguire movie and didn't know what another re-boot could really bring to the character.Firstly the casting is spot on. Andrew Garfield completely embodies the character. I thought Tobey Maguire did a job but Garfield puts him to shame in this movie. Emma Stone was absolutely fantastic as Gwen Stacey Other reviews have asked if this supposed to be Spiderman movie or Twilight, and yes I agree that the film concentrated a lot of energy on the character development and the relationships.I do not see that as a bad thing. Daredevil was not the best movie I have ever seen by any stretch of the imagination, but it made me feel an emotional connection to the characters in a way that many other superhero movies do not. The Amazing Spiderman takes that to the next level.If you are just looking for blockbusting action and fight scenes from start to finish then no, this movie will probably not deliver for you. However if, as a fan of comic books, you are just as interested in the lives and the motivation of both the heroes and the villains and seeing them have to deal with the same emotional issues that you do, no comic book movie has done it better.Go and see this movie! If you haven't seen a superhero film before because you think it isn't your thing, see this one! It brings something new! Not for everyone I guess, but I loved it.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","insidewonderland54","4 July 2012","*Not meaning to offend anyone just sharing my honest opinion* Really? are you kidding? I wasted my money on this! OK so they talked about Peter Parkers parents disappearing about 20 minutes of the movie and for that 20 minutes was a waste of time since it didn't even tell you what happened to them! And WOW i cant believe how ridiculous the death of Peters uncle was! the guy picked up the gun and the uncle just like runs into him or something honestly i really don't know what happened there.The only halfway amusing part about it was the old man listening to his music and seeing them fight behind him! Oh and Peter never found the killer of his uncle(unless i missed that part!) and thats lame he never did since that was the main reason he even made his suit and everything! ****I REALLY HOPE HES NOT IN THE NEW AVENGERS*****","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","bluesman-20","9 August 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man is very clearly a labour of love. The movie carries with it the same air that the early Stan lee Steve ditko stories did. Spider-Man is a tragic hero. His story has been told and retold. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man felt like a labour of love and it was. But James Webb's seems like it's attribute and a labour of love. He's not in awe of spider-man as Raimi is. Webb writes the movie like a updated version of the character as he was written in the 60's. Peter Parker is a sad sack. He's a nerd and yet he's a smart ass He knows what's right and what's wrong. He makes mistakes and yet he's not afraid to stand up for what's right.Webb's story is familiar and different and remarkably fresh.Peter Parker's parent's are scared of something and leave Peter with his aunt May and Uncle Ben. when the Parker's die in a plane crash Peter is raised by his aunt and uncle. but he has questions. when Peter becomes 16 he finds a briefcase belonging to his dad. inside he finds papers relating to his dad's research into genetic splicing. His father's old partner Curtis Connors is still alive and working for Oscorp. His uncle figures out something is wrong. Peter tries to keep this away from them. When he goes to Oscorp to meet Connors he meets his classmate Gwen Stacy. Gwen is a intern at Oscorp and she arranges a meeting with Connors. the meeting with Connors leaves more questions then answers. When Peter goes into a secured room with genetic spliced spiders he is bitten. Peter changes and develops spider like powers he decides to use the powers to show off. this has tragic consequences when Peter lets a criminal go. Peter's Uncle sees the man fleeing and tries to stop him only to be shot. When his uncle dies Peter realizes what his uncle had been trying to tell him all along. with great power comes great responsibility. He creates the uniform and the persona of spider-man and goes out looking for the man who shot his uncle.Peter protects the people of the city as best as he can. during all this he gives Connors his father's research and Connors completes his research. Connors uses it to regrow his lost arm only something goes wrong and he becomes the lizard. Peter's budding romance with Gwen takes a strange turn when her father police captain George Stacy decides to arrest the vigilante known as spider-man. meanwhile the lizard launches a attack against mankind which forces captain Stacy and spider-man into a partnership to stop him.The action is crisp and fast. the acting is spot on. the Dark Knight Rises was the better movie of the two. but this one has enough heart to hold it's own against Batman and the Avengers.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","tavm","30 July 2012","So 10 years after the first Spider-Man that was directed by Sam Raimi and starred Tobey Maguire and 5 years after the third and last by that team were released, we now get a reboot helmed by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield as the web-slinger. This time, we get some additional background concerning Peter Parker's parents when he was a pre-teen before being left in the care of Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). Though we once again have Ben killed by someone Peter neglected to stop earlier when he could've, the part where he initially becomes a wrestler after getting his powers doesn't happen to this version of his origin story this time. Instead of Mary Jane Watson, we get Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) who this time knows Peter's alter ego from the beginning. This is a refreshing change from having previous men behind the masks keep their secret ID from their so-called girlfriends like with Superman and Lois Lane (though it's good to know that's not the case now in the current comics) or Batman and various of his girlfriends. Compared to Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, The Lizard (Ray Ifans) doesn't seem so threatening though he still has a dangerous vibe, just the same. Oh, and for the record, I actually prefer Gwen who's very much of a brave heroine here compared to the often-damsel-in-distress-like fate of Mary Jane. I especially like some of the comic banter between her and Parker and also her father, a police captain played by Dennis Leary. Oh, and the scenes of Spidey swinging from building to building seem more realistic here compared to Raimi's more cartoony-like actions done by CGI. Not surprised to know that actual stunt men were involved. I don't really feel like comparing whether Maguire or Garfield make the better Frendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. I just appreciate the different takes both made in portraying such a legendary superhero. I only have some minor quibbles concerning logic: When Aunt May calls Peter on cell, Parker is still in costume with his mask on, so how can she understands what he says when his voice would be a bit muffled as a result? And how come we didn't see a funeral for Uncle Ben? Okay, otherwise, I did enjoy this reboot of The Amazing Spider-Man, even without seeing it in 3-D. So, yeah, that's a recommendation. P.S. I thought the Stan Lee cameo was another hilarious one...","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","christopher-tucker74","8 July 2012","I saw The Amazing Spiderman 3 days ago now, I did not want to write on something without really taking time to digest what I saw in the theatre. Is this movie perfect? No it is not. However it is very close.As people keep comparing the Rami series to this new one I will tell you why it is a great movie buy itself then go into why it is better overall than the other three.First, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone played their respective roles perfectly. It is like they somehow pulled the characters right out of the comics and brought them to life. And the chemistry between them right on (the subtle way that love creeps up and your not really sure how to act or what to say) Andrew Shows a true Peter Parker and a true Spiderman with all his banter at the bad-guys and himself. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are a true looking Aunt and uncle that have taken the role of parent (I have a friend living in the same circumstance ) and shown what it is really like. The scene in the house when they fight is very touching and makes uncle Ben's' death more hart breaking. Second, showing how peter figures out his powers was okay I didn't really like the football scene with the post bending (that was a little too much even for me) However the skateboarding to show how he has infinitely better balance and agility was a nice touch.Third, The villain was not great CGI and a bit rushed in making, however the fight scenes where very entertaining. Doc Connors was shown as a man divided my moral and personal choices and I would have liked to have seen more between him and Rajit Ratha. Oh and as my son is reading over my shoulder I have to put in he thought it was really funny through the whole movieOkay now for the comparison. People are complaining about No J.J, To bad J.J is not Spiderman nor was he in the Origin of Spiderman he comes in later on when he needs a job.Gwen Stacy is no Mary Jane. Of course not THEY ARE DIFFERENT Gwen is Peters first true love and Mary Jane comes later after her death. Gwen is Peters Intellectual equal and loves Peter for Peter. Mary-Jane Loves Peter cause he is Spiderman Toby vs Andrew - Andrew hands down, Toby is a brooding teen that nobody notices. This is not Peter Parker. Peter is a genus in is own right who tries to do the right thing based on the positive upbringing he had by his aunt and uncle and Andrew portrays this well.Okay and here is the Main reason why I liked this one better. It was not as campy (yes there is campy and then there is Rami campy) Rami's Spiderman was swimming in campy from the really bad Goblin suit to the overall tone of the film and let us not forget the landlord (that was a wast of time to sit through)This Spiderman brings us back to what Spiderman is about, trying to do the right thing but not always doing it right. And finding your way in a world that is very complicated. Are there plot holes and a few things that could be better sure, what movie is perfect (Except The Godfather) Now Spiderman 2 was a great movie but that was cause of the villains in it.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","karthik-mohan","30 June 2012","I had huge expectations from this movie. I had thought andrew would be,as they say, amazing. unfortunately, he was, well, himself!The story is pretty different from the previous spiderman movies. However, the first half is similar to the first half an hour of spiderman 1! yes, it is that boring! Andrew Garfield has done a pretty good job, but his dialogue delivery is kinda sad. I was really impressed by Emma Stone. she looks pretty and has a don't-mess-with-me attitude,which is crucial for her character. I found myself looking at my watch for almost most of the first half. The story, however, picks up in the second half with the advent of the lizard. The 3-D was mediocre, almost useless. So, basically, do not waste time and money at the theatre to watch this movie. you'd rather rent this movie out or download (oops, did i just say that?)!","7/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","liior","7 July 2012","I love superhero movies, they capture our intangible desires, and at times take us to a different world. However, with this horrible remake, I only begged for the movie to end faster. The first 45 minutes of the movie was by far the worst set up I have ever seen; I was falling asleep. The dialogue was BEYOND cheesy, and the performances were mediocre. It felt like the original plan was to make a romance flick and add spiderman as a bonus. The movie is a reboot of the franchise, but why oh why are the events almost identical to the original spiderman! My biggest disappointment, by far, was the lack of epic action scenes, they were all quick and boring. The parallels were weak and super corny: (not a spoiler) there was a scene where Peter forgets to bring eggs home, some time later he brings the eggs and it becomes a magical moment in cinema. Also, the lizard...was extremely unrealistic, almost to the point of laughter. Character development was poor and left me hanging. The plot points were childish, clich√© and meaningless. I'm sure some of you have seen the 4 minute trailer they released? That's as good as it gets. The trailer literally had every action scene and included all the interesting shots. It's like I was watching a 2 hour long version of the trailer, what a fail. There was nothing amazing about the amazing spiderman, I defiantly would not recommend wasting your money on it. Instead, just keep rewatching the 4 minute trailer! Much more entertaining!","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","RainDogJr","7 July 2012","There's a moment in THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN that is basically the quintessential romantic one involving a superhero: Spidey is about to take his girlfriend (Gwen Stacy) out for a little ride, to show her how New York City looks from the sky. I guess you know what I mean. And when the moment came I thought something like this: if director Marc Webb (who's only other film is the hit 500 DAYS OF SUMMER, which I have yet to watch) wants to take a few minutes for a sort of clich√©d romantic scene, well, that's just fine with me since until this point he has given me nothing but a great piece of entertainment. Eventually we don't even get to see pretty much nothing of that romantic kind of scene! So basically I was ready to criticize the film and at the same time forgive its flaws, but in the end that was just unnecessary. Yes, there's really nothing to complaint about this movie; (for instance) I did feel its last act could have been bigger and more exciting but then again, I'm here to forgive the minor flaws. It's actually a very similar case to what we had last year with RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES ‚Äì a very fine and fun reboot -visually great, with fresh ideas- that keeps you with a big smile (and that leaves you too with it since you just know really nice things will come in the future). During this past week I got to see a newspaper article of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN with the title ""The Unnecessary Spider-Man"". And yesterday when my girlfriend and I were about to watch the film, she asked me that if it was going to show the Spider-Man story from its very beginning again (and she ended loving it, by the way). Judging from yesterday's attendance at the cinema I went (it was a 6 p.m. showing in the opening day, to be exact), many people don't want to rush in order to see the ""same ol' story"" that a decade ago hit the big screen; yes, the attendance was quite low and boy did people missed a whole lot of fun and, of course, the great Lizard! To finish, I'll write some few more thoughts that do nothing other than recommend you checking ""Amazing Spider-Man"" as soon as possible¬Ö 1) You MUST go for the 3D version of it. And yes, I know that pretty much every film has offered a very disappointing use of this format so that's why I'm so glad to report that this looks simply amazing - I think the only other recent time I loved the 3D thing was in THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN. 2) Arguably a perfect example of a film with forgettable 3D material is THE AVENGERS. And ""Amazing Spider-Man"" is MUCH BETTER than that other big Marvel movie of the year! 3) The first time we get to see Spider-Man, with the actual mask and everything, doing some work has to be one of my favorite scenes in any superhero movie. His attitude is fantastically fun; Andrew Garfield fits the role perfectly, I must say. 4) Not my opinion but a fact: this has the best Stan Lee cameo ever; what a piece of scene actually, fun and imaginative (and a bit violent too!).*Watched it on 06 July, 2012","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","nekomathing","19 June 2013","not the best film but a great film for a action movie. it follows the comics a little. when I saw the film I saw it in 3D man it was good but this maybe is the best spider man film. a action film for people who likes action . but for some will say it is the worst spider man film . like the school scene that scene was a good scene really action the building the sewer this could also be a family film .this did not waste my time my buddies also liked it so did a lot of people .recommended film for people. good acting good movie . since marvel is better than DC in my opinion so I liked it a lot. but at this film it looks like peter parker or spider man seemed weaker than the past film. really action good for kids adults etc.If you are a fan of spider man you will like this.the villain the lizard was was really powerful maybe stronger than some villains in marvel. the spider man villains usually is stronger than a lot of other villainsGood film overall 8/10","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","phd_travel","13 January 2013","Going into this movie I was wondering what else they could do after all the recent Tobey and Kristen movies. I was pleasantly surprised it turned out to be different - more serious, with good acting and a compelling story that leads into a sequel.Andrew Garfield is a good actor if a bit mutant looking. He is quite good in the role. Emma Stone can play a wide range of ages and looks quite convincing as a high school student. She is more vulnerable and expressive than Kristen Dunst was in her role. Sally Field provides high quality supporting cast.The scenes of NYC and the swinging around are as good as can be expected.Liked it better than the Tobey versions. Looking forward to the sequel.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","brando647","28 January 2013","How many times must Uncle Ben die for our amusement? If ever there was a movie franchise that embodied modern Hollywood's obsession with rebooting and reimagining the past, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is it. It's only been ten years since Sam Raimi brought the web-slinger to the big screen and helped jump-start the comic book movie craze, and it's only been five years since the trilogy came to an embarrassing end with the dud that was SPIDER-MAN 3. Now, rather than pick up where the last films left off and continue on in exciting new directions with a new director, Sony Pictures decided we might as well just start fresh. And that means a reintroduction to Spider-Man's origins, despite the fact that everyone knows by now how Peter Parker came to be New York's web-slinging superhero. I have no problem with rebooting a character franchise and handing the direction over to a new talent, but I don't see why we need to retread old ground. The entire first hour of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN rehashes everything we've already seen in Raimi's SPIDER-MAN in 2002. Except this one is handled a bit differently, which I suppose is why it's supposed to be all right. Parker's parents are more of a central focus in his eventual decision to become Spider-Man and it's his investigation that leads him to his encounter with the radioactive spider in the first place. I'm not sure why it couldn't have been handled in a ten or fifteen minute flashback. When you think about it, Uncle Ben's death was retconned and altered the story with a few flashbacks in SPIDER-MAN 3 and it worked all right without spending an hour going over the whole scenario again.The aggravating part is, once the first hour is done and the groundwork for the Parker parents storyline is laid out, the movie shifts gears into a generic superhero storyline that loses interest. Spider-Man's first challenge in his new role is battling the Lizard. Dr. Connors was introduced in SPIDER-MAN 2 and maintained a presence through the last two Raimi movies, so we knew the Lizard was eventually going to make an appearance. I just wonder if Raimi would've handled him better as a villain. Raimi's villains were always interesting. Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus were near perfect, and even the villains in 3 weren't bad for the extent that Raimi was able to use them when crammed into a single movie. Connors has the appropriate motivation (regrowing his missing arm with cross-species genetics) and the Lizard's arrival on the scene is handled well, but his overall plan is just generic. It's a plan we've seen countless times before in other action films, both superhero and normal. As a result, the movie loses a lot of steam and only becomes interesting again when Spider-Man and the Lizard are battling it out on screen. I enjoyed the movie when I first saw it in theaters, even while recognizing that it had some problems. But each subsequent viewing has weakened it and now I'm mostly bored with the whole thing.My biggest complaint with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is that it doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie. I know the character has been involved in some darker stories but I've always seen the Spider-Man series as a more light-hearted, fun series. Marc Webb's reboot is almost depressing. There's a lot of low lighting and dark colors. Characters always act depressed and angry. Spider-Man fits in a handful of good quips when he's doing his crime-fighting bit but the majority of the movie feels like a downer. Cheer up, people. It's Spider-Man. Leave the gloom for Batman or the Punisher. On a more positive note, the casting was great. Andrew Garfield will make a fine replacement for Tobey Maguire if the filmmakers can lay off the drama and let him have some fun. Emma Stone is a beautiful Gwen Stacy and brings the most levity to the movie. Regardless of how depressing the movie gets, her character's bright eyes and optimistic demeanor comes through. Rhys Ifans was great as Connors, though it's a shame his CG Lizard reminds me of a Goomba from the miserable SUPER MARIO BROS movie. I suppose it's just the lack of a protruding snout. The filmmakers claim they did away with the snout because they couldn't really make him speak with it. That may be so, but at least he would look like a Goomba on steroids. Martin Sheen is wasted as Uncle Ben, and Denis Leary is one of the better characters with Captain Stacy. Really, for the most part, the casting was perfect and should've made for a better movie.THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is mediocre summer fun. If this had debuted in a year with weaker competition, it might've stood out more. But no, sorry, this movie has nothing on Whedon's AVENGERS or Nolan's DARK KNIGHT RISES. As a result, the introductory film in Sony's new Spider-Man series falls pretty flat and I doubt most people will find much more in it than throwaway entertainment before moving on to bigger and better comic book films. It doesn't live up to Raimi's first two Spider-Man films, but at least I can honestly say it was better than SPIDER-MAN 3.","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","disgruntledjigglypuff","22 July 2012","First off, this is only my opinion, but really my biggest issue with this film was that it was just kinda boring. About 30 minutes in, I already knew fundamentally everything significant that would transpire in the film. Now that in itself might be a given some might argue, however at that point in the movie, I assumed I would still enjoy it as I expected some spectacular action. Had I been impressed with the fight scenes and jumping around being Spiderman I don't think I would have cared as much about the boring story because it would be redeemed in another aspect. However, the action and special effects in the film were also...kinda...boring. In fact the most spectacular visual moment in the entire film where Spiderman jumps of the top of the tower antenna, and it falls with him as he saves himself was already shown to us in the trailer. I won't go into the fight sequences but for me there was just never really a moment that made my heart race. Lastly the soundtrack was terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible, feeling very out of place in many parts, most notably the fight between the Lizard and Spiderman in the High School. I would normally assume in a scene like that, which is Spiderman and the Lizard's first real physical confrontation, for the music to be more menacing, however it opts for a very happy and victorious theme music. Considering Spiderman doesn't exactly whoop the Lizard there, it's a little out of place. There is however a memorable humorous scene in that altercation.So...this is just kinda boring and not very exiting, as far as movies like this, I personally enjoyed more ""The A Team"",""Red"",""The Avengers"",""Thor"", the first two Spidermans, (Spiderman 3 was terrrrrrible).","9/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","projectxclan","4 July 2012","This reboot had a different feel then the other spiderman movies. The reason being is that this reboot felt more directed towards adults. This is not to say its not appropriate for younger viewers because its perfectly fine for most youngsters. This spiderman has very little scenes that grab at children rather more of a straight action film with no comedy. Spiderman was much closer to the original hero in this film and i can and did really appreciate that. I found that spiderman 4 would have probably done just as well as The Amazing Spiderman. The movie seemed to drag on much longer then needed with a very slow start. I think the only real thing that would appeal to people is that spiderman is not played by Tobey Maguire which in itself is worth at least a watch.","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","xavier-901-692784","4 July 2012","I didn't expect much and though I was surprised in some regards I was highly disappointed in others. I'll first say that I don't mind reboots if they add more to the story, but seriously, over half the film dedicated to how PP becomes Spidey, really? Overall I think the acting, directing, and cinematography were all well done. I blame the screen play on this one being bad, and for those that claim it sticks more to Comic than Sam Raimi's versions I can only ask ""what are you smoking?"" Yes, PP is bitten by a spider and No, there aren't glands that he makes webs with. But that is about as close to the Comic as it really gets. If one were to compare Webb's vision to Raimi's as to which one is closer to the comic, I think fans would pick Raimi's, though I have my misgivings about his vision as well. It was nice seeing Sally Fields in the film, and though I felt she may have appeared to young for the role, she came across as I expected the character to. Denis Leary and Emma Stone make a nice Father/Daughter combination, Andrew Garfield makes a believable replacement for Tobey Maguire, and Martin Sheen made a nice Uncle Ben.If I wasn't so bored with the rehash of Spidey's beginnings this film could have really been something to watch, as it is, save your money or go watch the Avengers. But if you really want to see it, wait about an hour after it starts before checking it out, trust me you won't miss anything we haven't already seen.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","griffolyon12","3 July 2012","We all know the story, teenager is bit by a scientifically altered spider, gets spider powers and becomes Spider-Man, what we didn't know was his past before he became the Spider-Man. To compare The Amazing Spider-Man to the original Sam Raimi Spider-Man, is like comparing apples to oranges. One is more character centric, where as the other is more light-hearted and melodramatic in the comic book style. The Amazing Spider-Man is a wonderful movie because it does not feel like a retread of the Sam Raimi original. Director Marc Webb and the rest of his crew have manufactured a Spider-Man movie that does not try to compete with what has been done before, but rather focuses on lesser known aspects of the character Peter Parker and makes the film a character piece rather than a large scale mosaic.It's evident when we are not treated to a shot of the New York City skyline till nearly ten minutes into the movie, that this Spider-Man isn't looking to impress with scope or scale. Rather the first thing we see is the tale of how Peter Parker's parents left him as a child with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, to never return for him. This is the greatest and most unique aspect of the film. The Amazing Spider-Man is up there with some of the great comic book story arcs, because it delves deeper into Peter's past than perhaps even some of the comics have done. Actor Andrew Garfield portrays Peter as a kid with a chip on his shoulder, having been abandoned by his own father he looks for fatherly connections with everyone from Uncle Ben to Dr. Curtis Connors, all the way to his girlfriend's dad, Captain Stacy. Garfield is the heart- and-soul of this movie, and he portrays Peter as an outcast rather than as a geek with no friends, and it works. He understands the character, perhaps even more so than Tobey Maguire did.While the story does retread some of the origin aspects from the Sam Raimi movie, the movie is constantly replaying them so differently, it never really crosses the mind that they are portraying some of the same events. The strength to this lies in the great screenplay from James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sergeant, and Harry Potter-alum Steve Kloves. The screenplay ties up Spidey's origin with Peter trying to uncover the mystery of his dad's old briefcase, which leads him to discover the source of his webbing, and his powers, but it also gives the movie a different through line than any other Spider-Man movie. We see Peter get bit by the spider, we see him discover his powers, we even see the unfortunate tragedy that leads him to donning tights, but what we see is a more realistic approach to how these things play out. The Raimi film is more operatic, focusing on the emotion of the moments, rather this film focuses more on how these moments work as transitioning points in the maturation of Peter Parker and coming to accept his parents' disappearance. Everything flows and transpires with an action-reaction style. Peter does something, which causes this to happen, or this happens affecting Peter, and this keeps the story always focused on him.As cheesy as it sound, The Amazing Spider-Man is amazing. The fight scenes between Spidey and his bad guy the Lizard are top notch, with some exceptional CG-camera work that creates the sense of being a fly on the wall zooming and flipping over the fight as Spidey zips around. Emma Stone is likable as love interest Gwen Stacy, and Martin Sheen is a terrific Uncle Ben, with that exceptionally lovable twinkle in his eye. Not to mention the film is well directed, joining the ranks of other Indie-Blockbusters over the past decade (Blockbusters with an Independent film aesthetic because they were made by an Indie director, this case Marc Webb). There are many directorial signatures in Webb's work that can be seen in both his first film, (500) Days of Summer, and this one. In particular the music video-like montage when Peter is messing around with his powers and skateboarding, it harks back to Webb's video roots and the multiple montage, music video-like sequences in (500) Days of Summer. To cap it off, the musical score from James Horner is heroic and beautiful at all of the right moments, being a worthy successor to the brilliant Danny Elfman music from the original movies.I loved this movie, it was fun, heroic, deep, and emotional. There are so many great scenes, one of my personal favorites being when Spider-Man saves a child from a burning car hanging off a bridge, or the finale when an injured Spidey gets aid from New Yorkers themselves. These scenes just symbolize what is so special about the character of Spider- Man. He has wit, but he's also got a huge heart and will almost always try to do the right thing, even if it nearly kills him in the process. The old Parker luck is with this one.I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 10 out of 10!","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","divncom","4 July 2012","Why did we need a Spiderman reboot when there are so many other ideas that could have been brought to life with the same budget, cast and direction?The singular answer is that the studio sees this and every other huge budget comic book extravaganza as an investment. A huge one. When you're monkeying around with an investment on this scale, you're conservative: You make just enough semi-relevant changes to justify the films existence. That just doesn't cut it though for such an iconic character. You must either accept or reject the notion that, in the end, all you will be receiving with this title is a slightly different take on the same old story. Don't walk into the theater expecting reinvention of the wheel.If you can completely embrace the notion that you will be force fed the same formulaic origins story from start to finish with pin point precision in playing identical emotional notes to its forbearer - you won't be severely disappointed. There just isn't a rational reason to have to lower your expectation, though. The primary reason I find this Spiderman unacceptable isn't that the character is boring. It isn't that the actors are bad - they aren't. Garfield is a particularly good Spiderman; better than Maguire. The main reason this film is unacceptable is that the bar has moved drastically. Hardcore comic book fans are packing the theaters with higher expectations than ever; the genre has evolved so to speak. With titles like X-Men first Class, The Avengers and The Dark Knight films in the same universe - this Spidey simply doesn't have the same impact as the ten years old predecessor. In this new, evolved universe fans are more savvy. We now expect the thrill rating to ratchet up higher; the contours to be more dynamic. We expect to see ensembles; teams and entire casts of superhero's working together in the same universe ... the Marvel movie universe. We expect a degree of suspense. This film has no suspense- of course not; not when we've seen it already before it begins. What we have here is something that might have been great 10 years ago. It's not great now; it's profoundly average in the context of the other comic book films surrounding it. If it's at all legally possible, I would sincerely hope that Spiderman exist (in a clearly defined and visible way) within the Marvel Universe that has so rapidly expanded ... leaving the web slinger in his own niche only makes him that much more insignificant. My hope is that somehow Spidey can be incorporated into the Marvel Universe in much the same way the Avengers worked; or in much the same way X-Men first class worked. Adding some comic book buddies will take some of the weight off of Garfield's shoulders ... he's a good Spiderman but I don't feel he can carry the load alone. Until then, it's the same old story - and your friendly neighborhood Spiderman is awfully lonely relying on the same old schtick.","10/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Pjtaylor-96-138044","14 February 2018","'The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)' promises the 'untold story' and yet gives us largely the same origin as before, oddly borrowing some specific elements that surely wouldn't be included if they hadn't been in the '2002' incarnation, while removing most of the connecting tissue between the events and thus severely reducing their impact. Peter Parker - here, a skate-boarding hipster whose idea of awkward is to talk too much but always manage to say the right thing - is bitten by a random spider, that isn't set up as being genetically modified, while visiting a lab. Within a couple of scenes, he is crawling about the walls with ease. It's almost like they couldn't be bothered to retell the origin story and so decided to rush through it, making the entire endeavour rather redundant as it's almost assumed you've seen the prior trilogy anyway. Even when the web-slinging action starts - which is well-done for the most part and compounded by some believable visual effects - you just don't care. Plus, it doesn't help that the film is painfully generic, too, both in terms of the story-telling and the directing. At with least Raimi's trilogy, even when it was at its worst it was still interesting. It's worth noting, though, that Garfield and Stone are notably good in their roles. Their genuine chemistry elevates the movie, which is at its best whenever they share a scene. 5/10.","6/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","donxavier","11 July 2012","First, let me just say that I liked the Raimi trilogy...yes, even Spiderman 3 was fairly good. Did it have some problems, oh yes, but mostly enjoyable.Anyway, when it was announced that Spidey was getting a reboot I, like many other people, thought why? Why is it necessary to throw out everything just because you're changing lead actors and director. Could've just stuck with the Peter and MJ relationship but with different actors and kept the current film continuity. Sure it would've raised some eyebrows but there would've been far less uproar than a complete retelling of the story.Where was I? Oh yes, this new Spiderman movie. While it's not terrible, it's FAR from great. It just has not heart to it, no drive. Everything in this story is so by-the-numbers that you can see every plot turn a mile away. That would be fine, even somewhat forgivable, if this movie was fun but that's not the case.Nearly every actor in this film seems miscast. From the generic guy playing Flash to Sally Field, right up to Andrew Garfield as the man in tights himself. No one seems to have a real handle on the character they're playing so they resort to archtypes. Emma Stone, as a prime example, slips into the same well worn shoes of the character she seems to play, with minor variations, in every movie: sardonic girl who wears her inner girl power on her sleeve. A little of that goes a long way.The effects in this movie were mildly disappointing for a big summer blockbuster especially Spiderman's web swinging and the Lizard. One of the ""improvements"" for this reboot has been the use of as much live action web swinging for Spiderman as possible, to make it look more life like. They must have realized early on that this was not the way to go because most of Spidey's web swinging is done at night, which I'm assuming is to hide the ridiculousness of a man swinging around in a harness.Then there is the Lizard. What a visual train wreck of a villain he is. With all the money that Sony sank into this ""reboot"" there wasn't enough to hire a better CGI effects team? The Lizard looks like he's straight from one of the Syfy Channel's ""Dinocrock vs Jurassic Lizard"" B grade films. OK, maybe not THAT bad but certainly not at the level one would expect from a film like this.This is getting long so I'm going to sum up my remaining criticisms of this film: 1) Everyone in New York knows that Peter Parker is Spiderman!!! I lost count of how many times he gave himself away, either by taking off his mask or displaying his superhuman abilities while in his street clothes.2) Guess when you're a parent of a future superhero, or the girl he likes, your life is pretty much over. Peter's parents vanish, Uncle Ben dies, Gwen's father dies...good lord! You're next May Parker.3) Sally Field and Martin Sheen were not believable as a couple. If it wasn't for the fact that they're named Uncle Ben and May Parker, I never would've believed they were married.Whew, there I've said my piece...now I'm going home. G'dnight!!","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","famu97","10 July 2012","Man that's an excellent movie. The acting is so much better than the original Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire. The new Peter Parker is 10 x's a better actor than Tobey Maguire. I enjoyed the Avengers movie but the Amazing Spiderman's plot works much better to me and the story-line just seems to pulls you along effortlessly and keeps you intrigued and interested at the same time. It's the great blend of story/plot, good acting, and action-adventure and fight scenes with the bad guy. As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the better ones. I think it's most definitely better than the last two Spiderman movies and probably better than the first one but not by too much.It is worth the price of admission to watch this movie and it would be a great movie to take your kids since their isn't anything crazy happening in this movie.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","alexisbessonmackain","11 March 2019","Just to make this clear for some, this was the second spider man live action film i saw other than spider man 3 which i both watched years ago and this fil has always struck meas really being underappreciated and i am not necessarily saying that this film is perfect but it doe a lot right. for starters, andrew garfield really gives a charismatic and funny performance as the title character and the rest of the cast, particularly emma stone and rhys ifans all do well in their roles, creating characters who are both relatable and sympathetic. i know some of you would say i have bad taste but hear me out. i do like the sam raimi films although they are not my favorite marvel series. i would agree with many that the film does take several plot points from the first spider man but that was inevitable given that this is a origin story. however, this film has a pretty good if slightly uneven storyline, particularly with some storylines left underdeveloped such as the catching of uncle ben's killer although i thought this was a smart move to leave things open to interpretation and dr connors also could have used more scenes and this is from watching the deleted scenes on dvd, some of which could have added more to the film. the storyline of peters parents disappearing is also one which i enjoyed as it helped differentiate this film from its predecessors but was not given enough focus and the sequel did not really sort this out in a good way either. when i mean i rank this superior to the sam raimi trilogy, it is because when i watch the films now, they seem oo humorous, campy and cringe-worthy for me and while i do enjoy humor in films, i have always enjoyed films that are more serious in tone which this film does quite well although it is certainly not a batman begins. finally, i would also like to mention james horner's musical score which is both emotionally stirring and adreline fuelling and is excellent in portraying the emotions surrounding each scene. visual effects are also pretty stunning too. overall, if i had to ta rak this film, i would call it my favorite spiderman film and the best superhero film of 2012 although chronicle is a close second alongside dark knight rises. it is a shame though that the sequel could not match up to this one","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","filipemanuelneto","8 November 2019","Following in the wake of the ream of comic heroe movies that DC and Marvel have been promoting, this film is just one more, and addresses, as it has been done before in the cinema, the iconic figure of Spider-Man, a one of the most remarkable and famous cartoon heroes ever. He has originated, at least, one trilogy (around 2000) and has now been recycled to make a few more movies, and a few million dollars in profits.This movie, like many others, tells how teenager Peter Parker became Spider-Man, with all the moral and psychological conflicts associated with such a radical transformation. However, we have seen this so many times that it was difficult to show anything substantially better without changing the character's story, which would be sacrilegious. So the movie just shows what we already know, selects a powerful villain from the long list of enemies the character has accumulated over decades of comics, and gives us the decisive confrontation between them.Andrew Garfield is a decent Peter Parker, but I confess he hasn't always convinced me. He has some annoying face movements, but he does what he needs to do. Emma Stone looked a lot better to me, but this wasn't the movie for her to shine. So she just made a good romantic match, having a good chemistry with Garfield. Rhys Ifans is equally good as a villain. Martin Sheen and Denis Leary also did well.The film is directed by Marc Webb, who seems to have done a decent job. The problem is that he didn't bet as much as he should on creating a good story and developing characters and the work of the actors. The concern was, from the beginning, CGI and visual and sound effects. And, in fact, on this issue, the movie is excellent. It's a visual show from start to finish, with sweeping New York views, great costumes and photography and immense camera movement, which gives a feeling of speed and agility to Spider-Man, who flies and jumps like never before. Soundtrack is also excellent, as epic as you'd expect in such a movie.I think the movie loses a little compared to other movies with other characters. It is not a movie that stays in memory, or can be said to be grand or excellent. Good dialogues are missing, a handful of more complex and developed characters, a more interesting and less trite story. It's a good and entertaining movie, has good production values, good actors and is visually spectacular, but that's basically it.","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Boba_Fett1138","11 July 2012","First of all, it was of course totally unnecessary to reboot the series again already. They might as well could had simply made this movie as a ""Spider-Man 4"", that way we wouldn't had to sit to another origin story, that besides isn't getting told as a very good or interesting one.And that is the foremost problem of the movie; I just couldn't really ever get into it. It didn't always had a very pleasant flow to it and things didn't always progressed and developed very natural. Things just happen and you have to take a lot of things simply for granted.There were plenty of things that bothered me about its story and storytelling. I for instance never bought into the whole romance between Peter Paker and Gwen Stacy. I have no idea what made them fall in love and what made their love so powerful or unique. Like I said before, it just happens but there is never really any notable chemistry or anything about it that makes you root for their love or make you feel and believe that these two persons belong together.The movie also does quite a poor job with all of the character's motivations. There is no good reason for Peter Parker to develop and put on a suit and swing through the city, trying to catch criminals. There also really wasn't a good enough reason for Dr. Curt Connors to turn into a super-villain and there was even less reason for him and Spider-Man to become enemies. With this I mean that their story lines aren't really interconnected good enough with each other and Spider-Man so easily could had decided not to get involved and not to get his life at risk, since it wasn't like he was being an established superhero in the city already, who everybody relied on. Another reason why this movie would had been simply better, had it been done as a ""Spider-Man 4"", instead of as a fresh start to the movie series again.It's a shame this movie failed to make any emotional impact on me since this obviously was the approach the film-makers were going for. A more personal and dramatic Spider-Man but the movie just really didn't had the right script for that. Even the whole uncle Ben storyline totally left me cold this time and so did the relationship between Peter Parker and aunt May, which always is an important aspect about the Spider-Man franchise, in my opinion.And for goodness sake, stop recycling your own music so much, James Horner!It of course remains a far from bad movie but there is nothing about it that stands out or make this a memorable or unique movie within its genre. It does absolutely nothing new but it of course does still provide some entertainment. I still did wish there was some more action in it at times though. But Peter Parker doesn't really become Spider-Man until halfway through and Dr. Curt Connors becomes the Lizard even much later on in the movie. It therefore takes a while for the action to truly kick in but when it does, it's all quite and fun to watch but overall the movie remains underwhelming, in about every way imaginable.Also can't say that I was very fond of the casting. Andrew Garfield never gave me either a Peter Parker or Spider-Man vibe. He feels miscast in my opinion and I definitely won't mind at all if he gets replaced with another actors for the next movie. As a matter of fact, I doubt I will even notice it, since he's so incredibly unremarkable in his role and I doubt I will recognize him on street, even now, when I have just finished watching this movie. He isn't being very likable or charismatic enough in his role.It really doesn't do or bring anything fresh, original or great to the series. Weak as a reboot and very mediocre as just another modern superhero movie.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","1/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Cineanalyst","29 September 2020","I wonder had the director's name not been Webb, would life had led him to directing a Spider-Man movie....Anyways, Funny that stealing is central to the story in ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" from Peter Parker assuming someone else's identity to burglarize a lab, to his complicity in a convenience store theft, or someone attempting to steal his father's work in the opening sequence only for Peter to later pass that work off as his own. It's funny because the movie is largely a lazy retread of the same notes hit upon in the last Spider-Man series, which had only wrapped up with its third installment half a decade ago when this was released. The major exception preventing me from ranking this lower is that there's improvement in the camerawork.As in ""Spider-Man"" (2002), the superhero saves some people while fighting a green villain on a bridge. Again, Parker has a personal connection with that man-turned-monster, both of whom have at least one or two scenes where they seem to be insanely talking to themselves in their mind. Despite a protagonist who is a photographer and swings between skyscrapers, the camerawork for both movies is largely disappointingly rudimentary. The reboot's ending is actually an exception, as the digital camera finally starts flying through the air along with Spidey. Parker's picture taking, however, hardly figures into this version at all--at least not in any interesting way. His newfound fascination with skateboarding and, evidently, hair products receive more attention. The movie itself is photographically darker, which may help to conceal some of the CGI, such as of the talking lizard, that already seems somewhat dated, or maybe it's just another pastiche of ""The Dark Knight"" (2008).Another scene here seems as though it were a direct quotation of the 2002 picture, where Spidey goes down an eerily familiar-looking alley (stylistically, that is) to save a woman from being harassed by men. In the 2002 version, this was actually a well-made scene, as far as tropes of a hero rescuing a damsel from a rape attempt go, culminating in that famous upside-down kiss. Not here. Another thing I don't like in this iteration is that Spidey's web slinging is a mechanical invention rather than a natural growth of the mutant spider. That made for a perverse puberty metaphor regarding the teenage superhero when you think about it. Andrew Garfield's character, on the other hand, besides stealing, also has sticky fingers for grabbing women--ripping the blouse off a subway passenger and, later, pulling and twirling Emma Stone in by the hip for a rooftop smooch.The Uncle Ben stuff is so familiar, I guess, that it seems as though the editors tried to rush through it, which kind of reminds me of a similar treatment of Bruce Wayne's parents in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Neither works well. They also cast Sally Field as Aunt May and, then, give her nothing to work with. And the construction crew plotline and music for the finale are hokey. Indeed, a lot of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" merely feels perfunctory. Not a movie made because anyone had a novel interpretation of the familiar comic-book series, but rather to satisfy Sony's demand to keep vomiting out Spidey movies every few years so as to keep their rights to the franchise so that they can keep vomiting. It's a vicious circle. The sequel turned out so bad they had to make a deal with Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe to keep their Spidey from being stolen. I don't get why this first one did fairly well with critics and audiences. Dennis Leary's police captain's hint of a Spider-Man v Godzilla flick sounds, well, if not better, than at least more ridiculously amusing to me than this popcorn fodder.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Bored_Dragon","9 August 2019","It wasn't very clear to me why would anyone make new Spider-man trilogy just five years after the previous one ended (quite poorly), but as I decided to see all Marvel flicks... I read IMDb reviews and cross myself. Tastes differ, that's a fact, but to rate this movie from one to three out of ten is nothing but spite. There is no way that anyone seriously thinks that this film is unwatchable crap, except of course if they look on the whole superhero genre that way, in which case it would be fairer not to evaluate it at all.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a reboot of the Spider-man franchise with a slightly different approach than Raimi's. The story is basically the same, but a bunch of details is changed. In some respects, this version is more faithful to the comic book, and in every respect I liked it better. The most obvious and critical difference is the characterization of Peter Parker, who, unlike the pathetic weenie from Raimi's version, is now a rebellious teenager with whom it is easier to identify. Also, Garfield is much more likable than Maguire, though he does not exactly fit the role of a nerd. The film has a great pace and balance of drama, action, and humor just to my liking. A little laughter, a little sitting on the edge of a chair, and two hours flew by. The only advantage of Raimi's version, very subjective though, is that, to me, Kirsten Dunst is much more attractive than Emma Stone, and the chemistry between her and Tobey is stronger than between Emma and Garfield.8,5/10","6/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","zkonedog","9 March 2017","After the incredible success of the ""original"" Spiderman series (now known as ""the Tobey Maguire one""), director Sam Raimi & Sony could not agree on a fourth addition to that franchise. As such, Sony decided to dump Raimi and reboot the series again despite the very short time frame. While this movie will almost certainly rack up huge profits at the box office over the summer months, its utter lack of heart and anything original/interesting will eventually become known and be its undoing.For a basic plot summary, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" reboots the Spiderman franchise with Andrew Garfield as the title character and Emma Stone as Peter Parker's teenage crush Gwen Stacy. Also along for the ride is Rhys Ifans as a scientist working to perfect inter-species DNA mixing, which of course sets the stage for the battle between Spidey & The Lizard.There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is actually just easier to go over them in list form:-The main problem is that the direction from Marc Webb and thus the overall tone of the film is just wrong. It tries to be a high school drama, action/adventure romp, ""Dark Knight""-style hero film, and even a part goofy comedy all at once. It fails at all of these aspects because it just doesn't establish an identity. Whereas ""Dark Knight"" works because it is so visceral and the original Spidey flicks work because they are more playful and light (like reading a comic book versus a graphic novel), this one falls squarely in the ""muddled middle"". -Andrew Garfield is a great actor, but his character is written so wildly inconsistent that it is literally laughable at times. There is no believe character progression or development whatsoever. One minute he is a goofy teenager, the next a brooding soul, and the next a punk, changing between the three for seemingly no reason at all. -This is too soon after ""Spiderman 3"", plain and simple. The first 45 minutes are so get tedious because, well, we already saw this stuff not so long ago. I can completely see what Sony was trying to do, but it just should not have been done. As previously mentioned, it will make a ton of money (at least at first) but inevitably suck the life out of the franchise. -Finally, there are also some scenes in this film that will almost make you laugh out loud as to their ridiculousness. Maguire's Spidey always teetered on the edge of dramatic/campy, but this time it descends into stupidity. You never know what you are going to get from scene to scene.The only bright point of the experience: Emma Stone's performance as Gwen. Despite the fact that she is terribly miscast as a high school student, Stone gives her character at least some charm. It is more than can be said for anything or anybody else in the movie.Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was one of the biggest letdowns I have ever experienced in the cinema. For me, it is closer to 1.5 stars on the ranking scale. In a Hollywood era where superhero movies rule right now, this one is a complete and utter dud.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","DarthVoorhees","22 July 2012","'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a mess of a movie. The classic hero formula gets old really fast. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' doesn't give a damn about any of it's characters or what motivates them. It wants money and that's all there is to it. Sony thinks America's movie going public is composed of a bunch of ignoramuses who will buy anything they shove Spider-Man's name onto. Sam Raimi made a trilogy of goofy films but at their best moments they defined Spider- Man and what he wanted to be. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is too dark and self important to work. Sony failed to understand the character and what drove him. I can imagine the writing of this script tried very hard to mimic 'The Dark Knight'. Spider-Man isn't meant to be this dark though. Here Spider-Man is more like Norman Bates than he is a superhero. 'The Amazing Spider- Man' has no idea what it is to be an adolescent trying to find their place in the world which I imagine was their intent in the rebooting of the franchise. What we get is a very flat hero who thinks he is well developed.""With great power comes great responsibility""Cheesy? Sure but it has a nice ring to it. Stan Lee in his own nerdy form of eloquence defined what drives every super hero. If you have the power to do good than you should. I am not a fan of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films but at least they had a character with a motivation. It's a simple and clich√© motivation but with proper weight put on it, it is brilliant. Spider-Man has gone into darker themes as a comic but never has he become a self-important cry baby as he is here. There is no origin or making of a hero here. The entire film is built around Peter's parents and some terrible secret they took with them to the graves. Fine but at least take us along on a journey with Peter. The film is forced to remind us about this with star Andrew Garfield going into little angsty crybaby fits. Uncle Ben which has served as the primary motivation for Spider- Man in the past is reduced to next to nothing here. Martin Sheen is good here but Garfield and this script give nothing back to the character. His death becomes mere exposition because we are meant to think something deeper and more sinister lies beneath. I sincerely doubt Sony has taken any sort of comic book into mind in the plotting of this would be franchise. I predict that sequels will drag along without the secret being answered and they will just having Peter be depressed about it. I doubt Sony even knows what the secret is. And so how does this effect the film? We have a miserable selfish hero that only cares about himself. This is the furthest opposite of all that Spider-Man was built upon. If Spider-Man ever got depressed it was because he was limited in the amount of people he could save. Spider- Man has great power here but it is self serving power. If I were Stan Lee I'd be ashamed that they did this to my character.There isn't really anything positive to say about any other area of the film. It's foundations are faulty and so nothing can really be built upon them. I imagine Denis Leary, Emma Stone, and Rhys Ifans could all be cast in the same roles in an excellent Spider-Man film.Rhys Ifans is actually kind of good as Curt Conners but the Lizard CGI is about as fake as anything you would see in a 'Transformers' film and so his performance is wasted.The problem is because the origin and mythology is so distorted and unlikeable that I don't care about anyone else. It's just an ordinary summer film really which needs a good story to become extraordinary. We see the same old action we always see. Raimi was better at web swinging action sequences because he embraced the cartoonish nature of them while keeping the integrity of the character. See Spider-Man 2. It's not a great film and it has it's share of goof ball moments but it has a defined hero.","5/10"

I would say so, but it still doesnt' feel that good, nor necessary.The director Marc Webb, who has an otherwise pretty solid track record, tries to emulate the darker, more serious tone of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy a bit, which is interesting, but feels somewhat stale here. Gone is the fun from the first two Sam Raimi films, and everything feels rather underdeveloped and uninteresting.The actors, many of them pretty big and iconic names, do a fine job, but don't work that well with a pretty subpar script. There is also lots of questionable and a little too obvious CGI throughout the film.Overall, it is pretty decent in its own way, but I would still call it a pretty bad film, even if it beats Spider-Man 3, of course.There was another sequel before this trilogy was cancelled, but I do not intend to watch it personally. This film didn't peak my interest a whole lot.Andrew Garfield got another shot in the role later on in the MCU, and rectified his story a bit, which is fun of course.Overall, I can't really say I recommend this. But it is okay, I guess.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Wscott3322","4 July 2012","The main actor for SM was much better than Toby. They girlfriend was a lot better looking than Kirston Durnst. But the fact of the matter was that the script was terrible. There were a few bit and pieces of action but the main story was a love story or no story. I would recommend you go see the Avengers again or wait for Batman. Or just rent it. I almost fell asleep. I have most likely seen 90% of every movie ever made and am a huge fan of superhero films. Saw the Avengers 3x in one week. This film is a total yawner. The main villain is just hard to believe and was poorly cast. Special effects were OK, sound was OK. I was forced due to times to see it in 3D which I hate. But the 3D was actually decent for this film.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","matthewssilverhammer","17 July 2017","There is no question that this movie is bad. The dramatic skateboarding. The laughable post-bite freak-outs. The obnoxious seriousness that pervades any fun that could be had. However, the worst part is just how unnecessary it all is. If any product ever screamed of money-grabbing, this is it. The times the movie works directly correlates to when Stone and Garfield are sharing the screen, or when he's fully suited.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Ryan_MYeah","23 October 2012","Most would probably look to Chris Nolan's intense and morally complex The Dark Knight as the pinnacle of the superhero genre (which it arguably is), but if you ask me, the Spiderman films from quirky director Sam Raimi were what validated the genre in the first place. With an expert mix of sincere emotion, stylistic action, and just the right amount of Raimi's trademark goofiness, Spiderman and its superior sequel saw the genre at its most entertaining. After the disastrously disappointing Spiderman 3, it seemed like an odd move for Sony to reboot the series so quickly. But what the newly released The Amazing Spiderman may lack in the same creativity, it makes up for with heart and scale.Peter Parker is your not quite average high school kid. He struggles with bullies at school, his feelings for Gwen Stacy, and trying to figure out the secrets of his deceased father, a former scientist at Oscorp who worked with Dr. Curt Connors, a man trying to invent a serum that would restore the amputated limbs of many people, including his own arm. Searching for answers, he is bitten by a genetic spider that gives him superhuman abilities, and through a series of events that take place, Spiderman, as we now know him, is born... again. But it isn't long after Peter takes up his job as the masked webslinger that complications arise, becoming sought after by the NYPD as a vigilante, and facing off with Connors, whose serum has transformed him into the hideous Lizard.Look, it's hard not to compare this to Raimi's first Spiderman film, especially when it revisits a lot of the same plot points, but it still provides its own uniqueness on the hero. Fun, funny, and superbly realized, The Amazing Spiderman also drags occasionally, and leaves several loose ends that may frustrate some viewers, or maybe just leave them scratching their heads. Action is also surprisingly spread out in light doses, but thankfully so in how it lets the story flow so smoothly. Marc Webb, director of the sleeper hit (500) Days of Summer, wouldn't appear to be the obvious choice for this movie, but you really begin to understand why he was chosen as the movie moves along.At the core of this movie is the irresistible love story between Peter and Gwen, delicately played by Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. This movie was what apparently led to the two stars becoming a real life couple, and it's easy to see why, because they share chemistry that makes the love feel genuine. The acting is uniformly good, from Garfield and Stone especially. The supporting performances from Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, and Martin Sheen are excellent, although I can't help but wish they'd have given Leary and his character George Stacy, Gwen's father and a captain of the NYPD, more on screen time.Technically, the film is excellent. The editing, though occasionally sluggish, is still carefully handled by Alan Bell and Pietro Scalia. The effects supervised by Jerome Chen are pretty stellar, and Shannon Mills and Addison Teague provide creative and robust sound effects. Prepare to be blown away by composer James Horner, who gives us his greatest musical score since that of Titanic, a thematically rich and proudly old fashioned throwback complete with a heroic, and memorable main theme. It truly is spectacular, barely surpassing Danny Elfman's music for Raimi's movies in the process.In short, though it's really not something I'm encouraging anyone to look too deeply into, did we really need this movie so soon after the originals? Maybe we didn't, but for what it is, you can't fault it for not quite living up to high expectations when it still is pretty entertaining. Not as amazing as the title may imply, but close enough.**** / *****","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","scoup","10 July 2012","I'm not sure how anyone rated this movie over a 7. Maybe someone who who hasn't seen another Spiderman movie or a teenager could think it's great, but rest assured it is NOT.Green Lantern was bad and I gave it a 6, but I'm giving this a 5 because it's a reboot and did not need to be done. There are plenty of good writers so there is no excuse for the poor script.Spiderman was boring and unoriginal. My mind wondered throughout the movie due to lack of empathy for the characters and plodding pace. I was more interested in my own thoughts of imagining how Christopher Nolan would have done the reboot and how much better it would have been - what a pity.Here are my gripes: Costume was bad (at least Green Lantern had a cool suit); subway scene was dumb - Parker immediately gets powers with no real bodily effects and putting a cold beer bottle with weight on his forehead doesn't awaken him, but a DROP of beer jolts him to the subway roof - laughable, cue my eye-roll - and where was the Spidey sense????;Uncle Ben's death was not as emotionally affective as it should have been. Aunt May just seemed off - 2002 Aunt May all the way; Dr. Connors was mishandled and boring - i do not buy that his motivation for trying the serum is the threat of being fired; he lost his arm and wants to be whole; Denis Leary - underutilized and needed more screen time; bad move killing him off because he was the one person I would have liked to see in a sequel; Mask - why is he always taking his mask off??? This seems out of character and reckless. Any retard knows to keep your identity a secret - and Parker is a genius, right? He can build web slingers and solve the formula problem that dozens of scientists have been working on, but he can't make a mask to keep on his face?; Bridge rescue - clich√©d and no dramatic tension (glad to see Jim Halsey and was thankful for the distraction of remembering how much I liked The Hitcher. Five minutes of that movie had more drama and tension than the entire Spiderman movie); Crane scene - contrived, forced and just ridiculous; love story - not even remotely developed; Parker does not go to the funeral when her dad dies??? The man who let him go??? No way. They did not look like teenagers - too old; $10 minimum spend to take a penny - pathetic script writing which should have been cut; Hype about movie being darker and Parker wittier - epic fail. They should have gotten a script doctor from Iron Man to give it look.Spider Bite - his father's research work is the basis for the genetically mutated spiders, but Parker does internet search for information????????? Not look at his father's work??? Because when I look for cutting edge research information on secretive work worth millions of dollars which gives me superhuman powers, I go right to the internet...and ignore the work that cost my father his life;Music - atrocious. You know it's bad when you you are actually thinking about it - normally music should be seamless in the movie and on all too rare occasions does the viewer encounter beautiful scores. I had to look it up and James Horner who won awards for Titanic and Avatar is listed. I guess you can't win them all, mediocrity would have been a step up; CGI - ehhh; CGI Hulk in Avengers was good, nothing stood out here; Gwen in closet - spray can of fire to scare off mutant lizard with regenerative powers and superhuman strength??? Conclusion: Disappointing movie that should have been better from a reviewer who is not a fan boy of Raimi. Examples of movies that did it better are Batman, Iron Man and Hulk (Norton, but there is room for improvement here). Clearly there will be a sequel because the studio is making a lot of money - they need to regroup and produce something better.I am anxiously awaiting the Hulk reboot with Ruffalo and hope it is better than The Amazing Spiderman.","6/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","fernandoschiavi","10 April 2020","It is undeniable that Spider-Man is one of the most popular and beloved Marvel world. Since its emergence in the early 60s, its creators, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, with the idealized characteristics make more humanized among other comics characters of the same era. With the various impasses, Columbia Pictures chose to dispense with Sam Raimi and decided to reboot the franchise from the beginning, showing Peter Parker in high school, being bitten and learning to be Spider-Man. The studio called Marc Webb and the screenplay was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves, based on a story by James Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt had the thriller Zodiac (2007) directed by David Fincher as their most outstanding work so far, Sargent has had experience in the Spider-Man franchise was scripted as the second and third films of the hero, and Kloves was responsible for almost all adaptations of the Harry Potter books to theaters. In this new script would be the villain Dr. Kurt Connors / Lizard, who was present in the three previous films, played by Dylan Baker, but always as an extra. Marc Webb also wanted to give greater prominence to the story involving the parents of Peter Parker. Finally, it would be the first film involving the hero also released in 3D format.Andrew Garfield - who had been prominent in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) Terry Gilliam and The Social Network (2010) David Fincher - was chosen as the new Peter Parker / Spider-Man after being released that several actors were quoted to interpret the character. Josh Hutcherson, Jamie Bell, Michael Angarano, Alden Ehrenreich, Aaron Johnson, Logan Lerman and Anton Yelchin were some of these names. Here it is for the role of Gwen Stacy were listed Mia Wasikowska, Teresa Palmer, Diana Agron, Emma Roberts, Imogen Poots, Lindsay Lohan, Lily Collins, Ophelia Lovibond, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Georgina Haig and Dominique McElligott Hilary Duff, but in the end was Emma Stone, one of the highlights in recent years in Hollywood in films like Zombieland (2009), Easy A (2010) and Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011), which was chosen to live The First girlfriend of Peter Parker. Here it is to live the villainous Lizard, Rhys Ifans British overcame the likes of Michael Fassbender and Christoph Waltz, winning the role. With a generous budget of about $ 220 million, filming finally began in December 2010 in various locations in the state of California, as Immanuel Presbyterian Church, St. John Bosco High School, and Taft High School in Los Angeles, and Also in New York.Marc Webb made some changes in his version, trying to make Peter Parker more realistic, we can say that this film uses assumptions similar to what Christopher Nolan did his hundred Batman Begins. The saga of a teenage Peter Parker more (even if you compare with Tobey Maguire who completed 37 years at the time of release of this film) is much more conducive to further exploration humorous superhero school and uncles home. Beyond the humor, you can also highlight the mood changes relevant to age, rage and conflicts arising from their newfound identity.The producers clearly more humanized the character, and the proof is that Peter Parker has more prominence than Spider-Man. Webb wanted to drive something more grounded in reality and it affecting the emotion of the scenes, the physical action and the clothes. Hence we have a deepening relationships of the characters, further exploration of the past of Peter with his parents, and a more paup√°vel that it develops its technological apparatus, behaves, and is inspired to produce their clothing hero. The paths traced are less based on Steve Ditko world and probably closer visually and more influenced by the Ultimate universe, but also quite a world of our own creation. The director also made other changes in this new version, like the fact that Peter skating and taking the traditional glasses Peter Parker in many scenes, giving contact lenses to the boy. In fact, since the character was created by Stan Lee, moved very concept of the ""nerd"" in recent decades, and these changes are incorporated in the current reality and understandable. The most important story was kept as Peter being a kid excluded and lonely by choice, being hard to get close to him because it has been abandoned and did not want that to happen again.Another change is a greater emphasis on the genius of Peter. In this film we see their direct participation in the creation of the formula that gives the appearance of villain - what planet infect an entire city making them become reptiles - in addition to equipment scattered his room as the lock on the door, and especially in creating the web-slinger as soon as he decides to fight crime with the alter-ego Spider-Man - though here he uses material from Oscorp to enable your weapon / means of locomotion. Many fans criticized the release of Sam Raimi in which the webs leave directly from their hands as a result of genetic change occurred by the bite of the spider, as here, the webs are created by a device invented by Peter, following the history of comics and highlighting the genius of the young. Another most striking feature is the sense of humor of Spider-Man, which as in the comics, every time he encountered his enemies and villains possessed a mood much more acidic and fun. Bringing to the present day, it is as if Peter was the anonymity of the internet into that uniform and could be more sarcastic.Known peo photography work on director Michael Bay movies like The Rock (1995), Armageddon (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001) and other blockbusters like Night at the Museum 2 (2009) and The Green Hornet (2011) John Schwartzman probably realize your best work to portray the most realistic and dramatic side desired by Marc Webb. Schwartzman was facing the challenge to film entirely in 3D without any conversion, putting the viewer in the place of Spiderman in action scenes. All outdoor scenes and capture the most dangerous side of New York, a darker side and dark city.Even the indoor scenes, whether in home environments uncles Peter at school Midtown, in the sewers of New York or within the laboratories of Oscorp, the climate darker and bluish scenes amplify the threat of the villain or villains of the city. It is important to say that not all the footage actually occurred in New York, as some outdoor scenes and studio also occurred in Los Angeles.
The production designer of the late J. Michael Riva - also responsible for the first two films in the franchise Iron Man - does a great job of riding the school where Peter studied by giving the modern technological environment in Oscorp laboratories by dangerous sets of sewage, and creativity in building every room in the house of his uncles Ben and May, especially in Peter's room, where we see several of his idols, tastes and passions, from his love of science and inventions (which lead to the creation of the trigger webs, but not fluid in web itself, the work of his father), his passion for photography and even your taste in movies and series, with ""Rear Window"" and ""Community"" gaining places on their wall.More than essential in action movies, the soundtrack is composed by this time 2 time Oscar winner James Horner. Responsible for soundtracks to films like Titanic (1997), A Beautiful Mind (2001), House of Sand and Fog (2003), The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008) and Avatar (2009), Horner easily transforms the work into something grand and exciting, even bringing strong remnants of his compositions for ""Titanic"", helps create moments of excitement and tension. Even being a soundtrack of personality and very versatile, is lower than the track from Danny Elfman in the first two films of Sam Raimi.Marc Webb confirms the intention of leaving everything including the real consequences of the actions of Peter. Peter actually shows quite bruised after fights, and his movement resembles the practice of ""le parkour"", with action poses referring directly to the stage character designed by Todd McFarlane. Adding to the mood during the fighting, the Spider is nicer than shown in the versions of Sam Raimi. The action scenes are also very well directed and realistic as the scene of the discovery of the powers in the subway, darkest death of Uncle Ben, the development of powers skate tricks, all the fights with Spider Lizard in the sewer, in high school and Oscorp tower. The presentation of the interior of the laboratories of Oscorp and Gwen's house, as well as the dialogues are very positive overall. The famous scene from the film Sam Raimi's kiss with Peter and Mary Jane upside-reversed, is replaced by the scene in which Peter grabs Gwen to the web and pulls on the balcony of his apartment building.The Amazing Spider-Man had the challenge of proving its existence being launched just 10 years ago the original film and 5 years of the end of the first trilogy, and managed to justify their existence. With a new director and an interesting vision for the franchise, with a cast unquestionable, with a technical finesse evident and well done and exciting action scenes, the franchise is renewed and open space for future sequels. A top notch entertainment and more faithful to the comics than with a longer expected expansion of this universe and this without the weight until the release of this new version, the expectation is even better future films.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","masonsaul","1 January 2019","It's too similar to the previous Spider-Man movies in its plot which makes it feel unnecessary but The Amazing Spider-Man is still a really good reboot that manages to create some of its own iconic moments and set pieces as well as a recognisably different style and tone.Andrew Garfield gives a great lead performance, even if somethings feel a little out of character for Peter. Emma Stone, Martin Sheen and Denis Leary all give really good supporting performances. Rhys Ifans is a really good villain with mostly believable motivation.Marc Webb's direction is fantastic, the film feels extremely practical, probably more than it actually is and the action sequences are well shot and enjoyable. The CG is consistently strong throughout. The music by James Horner is amazing, stylistically different to Elfman's themes but still heroic and iconic.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","FlashCallahan","7 July 2012","Peter Parker is an outcast high schooler who was abandoned by his parents as a boy, leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is today. Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy, and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner.As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny.....My expectations were very low for this movie when I heard it was being made. Initially I thought what was the point, to me Spiderman is still a new movie, and to be honest, the last movie wasn't all that good.But truth be told, I wasn't expecting this, a brilliant movie, but on a par with Spiderman 2.The cast are a lot better, and Garfield nails as Parker, this is the Spiderman we got from the comics, not the wet blanket that Maguire gave us with just looks of awe every other minute.But it does hark back to the first movie, New Yorkers coming together toward the end, the main Bad Guy having some sort of chat with himself, even the guy who killed Uncle Ben in the first movie is the limo driver!! The relationship between Ben and Peter feels more real in this, and it really does have more emotional impact when he is shot this time around. but it is totally a different movie this time around. It's all about high school and Parker gets hurt in this, quite a lot showing his vulnerable side.Spiderman being more cocky is the biggest positive for the film, even though he is in peril, he still has time for a one liner. Stone is amazing as Stacey, she really is more than a damsel in distress (Hello Kirsten).The Lizard is an okay villain, but it just feels like a way over the top villain, and despite a good turn from Ifans, his prerogative just feels like the Jokers from Burtons Batman.It's a well made film, very exciting, and very funny too, I laughed a lot through the film, the inclusion of the new webs is great too, they seem more fluid I this one and are more intricate to Spidermans powers in this, with these he wouldn't be doing what he does.See it and enjoy it, it's really worth seeing","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","aidanratesmovies","26 November 2021","Nearly on par with Raimi's Spider-Man 2 with a familiar outline from Raimi's first Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man holds its own among the franchise as a charming and emotional rendition and focuses on what truly matters most. First off, I just thoroughly enjoy the look of this film, it's very unique full of cool-blue colors and the CGI is just incredibly well done for the time. Andrew Garfield may not be the best actor to take on the role as the web-slinging hero, but he certainly makes the character his own, and for me truly encaptures what it means to be Spider-Man himself. His performance as Peter Parker may not match Maguire's or Holland's just as Maguire's doesn't quite match Garfield's charm as Spidey- but he truly does hold his own and provides a refreshing new take on the character we hadn't quite seen on screen before. Besides focusing on just Garfield as Spider-Man there are many other great actors throughout the film as well, including but not limited to: Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Rhys Ifans and Dr. Curt Connors, and the amazing Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben (an absolute perfect casting choice). The story can be a bit too familiar for its own good at times, and its final battle scenes can be a bit too formulaic and predictable. It has its tonal flaws every now and then, but for the most part, it's much darker than other iterations in the past, and I quite enjoyed a more serious brutal take on the character and the look of it throughout. In the end, The Amazing Spider-Man is far from perfect- but it does manage to hold its own and have enough charm to spare. It may not be the best film of the titular hero, but it certainly makes for a fun ride.My Rating: 8.4/10.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","nickmesafilms","17 July 2012","Directed by Marc Webb, and released to immediate box office success, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a reboot of the original Spider-Man trilogy from director Sam Raimi, that's also the first in a new and re-imagined version of the series! I have been looking forward to check out this movie ever since the news came out. But even though I was entertained by the majority of it all, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is my first big disappointment of the year, but it sure is a guilty pleasure. This movie follows the exact story about a boy in high school, Peter Parker, whose been abandoned by his parents, lives with his aunt and uncle, and can't fit in with his surroundings. Until he gets bit by a radioactive spider, gets impossible powers, something tragic happens in his life, and now becomes Spider-Man. It's the basic idea, yet retold in quite an unnecessary way. That's just my main problem with this movie, now that I've seen this film, it's finally clear to me that a reboot of the Amazing Spider-Man just wasn't a bright idea. I know that some reboots like to change some material, to not make it too similar to the original story. But this movie definitely takes the cake, making major changes to a story that doesn't need to be re-told. Also, this movie totally falls into a mother-load of plot holes. The movie tries to focus on Peter trying to find out what happened to his parents, and live through the tragedy involving his uncle, but the movie quickly takes that away, and instead focuses on Spider-Man saving the city from the Lizard. This movie had no clue which way it wanted to follow! But, did I mention that it was kind of long, and at the same time, kind of slow? Yeah, that's what I thought! But, good news, there were a few positives that helped save this movie. The casting is completely brilliant, all delivering such wonderful and memorable performances. Andrew Garfield really saves this movie, recreating the role of Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man. If it wasn't for his performance, this movie would have fallen to the ground. In every scene, he delivers a great charm to the performance, and makes the audience support him throughout. Emma Stone is also great playing Parker's love-life Gwen Stacy, whom also shares a believable and glowing chemistry between her and Garfield. I bought the romance in this movie, and these two guys were cute together. Although not really interesting as the Lizard, Rhys Ifans still delivers a great performance as Dr. Curtis Connors. Denis Leary plays Capt. George Stacy, Gwen's cop father hunting down the masked hero, and Uncle Ben & Aunt May are portrayed masterfully by Martin Sheen and Sally Field, respectively. The effects are astounding, the music is haunting, and the action scenes just help save this movie by delivering what I came for, fun popcorn entertainment. But overall, there's nothing really special about this movie. Some scenes kind of feel misplaced, there are tons of giant plot holes, and changing this story wasn't that smart. Nothing is terrible about this movie, because I still came to this movie and got what I wanted. I just wish that this movie could have been a lot better, and I was really expecting more from this giant motion picture. Not a terrible film overall, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a fun spectacle, but it's barely quite not the right choice to be rebooted. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", in my review, ""exciting fun, but sadly unnecessary"".","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Doylenf","10 July 2012","Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone make a likable enough pair as the teens who find themselves in a heap of trouble once they learn that Dr. Curt Connors (who transforms himself into The Lizard), intends to make huge trouble for the unsuspecting denizens of the city.It takes an hour for the story to start unwinding at a faster pace, once we learn about Spidey's parents leaving him to live with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (Sally Fields and Martin Sheen). But once bitten by a spider, after a forbidden excursion to an experimental lab, the story leaves some of the character development behind and takes off once Spidey discovers his power of web flights and his ability to deal with school bullying.Garfield never seems quite as vulnerable in the role as Tobey Maguire, but there's a sensitivity necessary for the more intimate scenes. He handles the action scenes well. Rhys Ifans does a commanding job of histrionics as the scientist whose regeneration of lost limbs transforms him into The Lizard, with spectacular effects.James Horner's score is very effective at capturing all the thrills and excitement of magnificent photography and the special web effects are all any CGI fan could ask for, even when seen in 2D.But there's an obvious discrepancy between the rather ordinary script and the magnificent special effects that will leave some disappointed that more time wasn't spent on the script itself furnishing a better story treatment.The whole thing is stylishly directed (especially in the action scenes) by a director with the apt name of Marc Webb.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","zardoz-13","10 July 2012","Sony Pictures has ignored the old adage: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Five years ago, the studio canceled the fourth installment in the Toby Maguire ""Spider-man"" franchise with original director Sam Raimi at the helm. Sony cited escalating production costs as justification for abandoning the series. Now, not only has Sony rebooted it with a different director and a different pair of leads, but also the studio has retooled it with a darker screenplay. You could call it ""The Dark Spider Arises"" because the filmmakers are channeling ""Batman"" in this entry. Unfortunately, ""The Amazing Spider-man"" isn't as amazing as the original ""Spider-man."" ""(5oo) Days of Summer"" director Marc Webb struggles with two problems: a lackluster villain straight out of a bad B-movie chiller and a drawn-out running time. Essentially, ""The Losers"" scenarist James Vanderbilt, original ""Spider-man 2"" scribe Alvin Sargent, and ""Harry Potter"" penman Steve Kloves have kept intact most of the best parts of the original. Dare they depart from the canon? Happily, they've have retained the radioactive spider bite, the confrontation with obnoxious Flash, and the marvelous web-slinging training sequences. Webb and his writers have put into effect some interesting changes. Ostensibly, except for a single close-up on a stack of newspapers, they have omitted the Daily Bugle newspaper. This time around they show Uncle Ben's murder in graphic detail, an event that occurred off-screen in the original. Further, they have made the heroic Peter Parker a lot smarter than he was in Toby Maguire's incarnation. Along the way they have forged a few surprises, particularly with Peter's other romantic interest; Gwen Stacy has replaced Mary Jane Watson. Peter contends with new antagonists both natural and supernatural. The most prominent villain is Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), while the second is Gwen's father, New York Police Department Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) who abhors vigilante interlopers and has nothing but contempt for Spidey. Unfortunately, the film stretches itself perilously thin in the final quarter hour into a 136 minute running time. Actor Rhys Ifans' maimed scientist villain is seamlessly mutated into a giant green lizard, but he lacks half of the ferocity that Maguire's adversaries provided him with in director Sam Raimi's trilogy. The Green Goblin was a lively, audacious adversary, but The Lizard is rather dreary. The special effects are terrific as is the cinematography. Although he is 28 years old, British actor Andrew Garfield looks more believable as a skinny teenager than Toby Maguire. Indeed, he would be fantastic as Norman Bates if Hollywood ever reboots the Hitchcock classic. Several scenes stand out in ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" The scene on the Williamsburg Bridge when Connors mutates into the Lizard is one of the best, with the nimble Spidey compelled to save multiple characters. The most memorable is a little boy stuck in an SUV. What makes this instance so significant is that our hero identifies himself as Spider-Man to a grateful father (C. Thomas Howell) after he has rescued his son. When our hero rushes off to warn Captain Stacy about the malicious machinations of Dr. Connors, Stacy reacts with disbelief because Connors is Gwen's mentor. The scene where Spidey tests his new found abilities to leap and lung is reminiscent of Kevin Bacon's dance antics in the original ""Footloose.""Martin Sheen is good as Peter's uncle, but he cannot eclipse Cliff Robertson in the Tobey Maguire origin. Gwen learns about Peter's alter-ego Spider-Man when he shows up battered at her room in a New York high-rise apartment. The chief difference here between the Tobey Maguire ""Spider-Man"" and Garfield's is that Gwen and he don't kiss with our hero dangling upside-down. One of my chief complaints about this slick reboot is the scene between Peter Parker and Flash. After Peter acquires his mysterious powers at Oscorp, he humiliates Flash on the basketball court and is summoned to the principal's office. Later, Uncle Ben reprimands our hero for wanting a little payback. Stan Lee shows up for his usual cameo. This time around he is in the high school library wearing head phones while the Lizard and Spidey tangle with each other.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Mysterygeneration","21 December 2021","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a remake of the Sam Raimi classic from 2002. For its hero, the film uses footage from ""Superman,"" ""Batman,"" and ""King Kong."" The Amazing Spider-Man is a slick, exciting, and well-designed film. The action is largely well-coordinated, and the CGI is a step up over Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man film. Continuity issues and huge logical failures, according to the me. The film is two and a half hours long and leaves a lot of unanswered questions.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","amarcusma","8 September 2021","It was just 3 minutes ago I saw this movie for the 5th time. I came into realisation that this movie has an amazing ending. The ending almost made me cry, and I really think it is thought out. And just based of the ending I am rating this movie 10/10 stars here on imdb.com.SPOILERS!In this movie you can see how Peter really needs Gwen and as tragic as it may seem she dies. You probably wonder why I think that is good, why exactly I think it is food is because you get this kind of ending where you don not long for seeing a new movie with Gwen and Peter and instead a movie with Spider-Man in it.A second thing about the movie that almost made me cry was how brave the little boy in the end was. That he stood up against ""Rhyno"". And then Peter (Spider-Man) swoops in and takes over and completly destroys ""Rhyno"".And this is why i think this movie has one of the best endings of all Spider-Man movies.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","ttvisdabestbtw","22 October 2021","The Amazing Spider-Man... ""the worst Spider-man"" as many like to call it. And while that is true it has honestly grown on me. The chemistry between Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield is great, in my opinion the best romance chemistry in any Spider-man story. His sense of humor makes the fights great. The lizard is a boring villain in my opinion, but The other things in my mind make it up. It may be the ""worst Spider-man movie"", but it's not horrible.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","martimusross","18 June 2019","The Amazing Spider-ManYes of course it goes without saying the Tobey Maguire first three movies were brilliant but this movie is on a whole new level.In many ways this genre has come of age in this movie, it just had everything, we had the perfect balance between action and story, comedy and tragedy, light and more serious issues. Overall it was a dark, sinister and menacing movie.Andrew Garfield is just a fantastic actor and perhaps my personal favourite as Spider-Man. His geeky look works here but he will struggle to find roles in the future as he is not ideal as a romantic or action figure, a similar position to Ben Wishaw.I can't find any fault in this fantastic movie","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","hitchcockthelegend","16 December 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and collectively written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. It stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by John Schwartzman. Peter Parker (Garfield) was orphaned as a boy when his parents were killed in a plane crash, raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field), he is a clever lad but something of an outcast at high school. While investigating the disappearance of his parents and sporting a crush on class mate Gwen Stacy (Stone), Peter's life is tipped upside down when he is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him abnormal powers.While the Spider-Man franchise doesn't (thankfully) come packaged with the kind of bizarre mania that comes with Batman, the acolytes are a tough bunch to figure out. Sam Raimi's trilogy garnered close towards $2.5 billion worldwide, yet now, with this reboot (actually it's a reimaging) trundled off of the Sony production line, there are plenty of ""fans"" coming forward to say they never rated Raimi's films! Magurie was this, Dunst was that, Raimi missed the beat of the comic version of Spidey and etc and etc. Well I'm sorry, but I just don't remember any fall out apart from the near unanimously agreed upon over stuffing of Raimi's part 3. Perhaps I just didn't go on the right Spider-Man forums? But even then it's hard to argue with a box office take of $2.5 billion, those figures have to be made up of a good proportion of Spidey fans, surely? You would reasonably think¬ÖI mention it because The Amazing Spider-Man has met with reviews from each end of the scale. Those at the high end who support the ""reimaging"" seem to focus on it being close to the real Spidey universe they wanted, with great casting, better effects work and a origin story of worth. At the other end is the arguments that ""reimaging"" a film that is only ten years old is daft, especially since it actually doesn't bring the promised new direction or origin story of worth. In fact it just juggles bits of the Raimi trilogy and plays it out with other Spider-Man characters instead. While Garfield is hardly an improvement since he's way too old for high school as well! The truth is that Webb's movie falls somewhere in between both sides of the argument, and that's not just me being Switzerland and staying neutral! Negatively it plays out as a compromised production and not the film that the makers initially set out to make, there are too many dangling threads and haphazard edits that leave narrative gaps. An Important character disappears off the radar, other characters are given limited time to breathe, and crucial plot points are arrived at with stupendous leaps of logic. A coda spliced into the end credits tries to entice us for the sequel, suggesting that the quick wipe over the origin ""origin"" story was deliberate, it's unlikely, and feels like an afterthought. For a film that purports to be putting its own stamp on the Spidey universe, it quite often makes you think of Raimi's films anyway. It may be The Lizard instead of Green Goblin and Gwen instead of MJ, but the emotional and psychological beats are still the same. Reboot? My arse. Oh and Horner, who I'm normally a fan of, has turned in a score that lacks vim and vigour, it aspires to be full of swirling superhero fervour to raise the goose flesh on your arms, but instead it's just goose, and not a decently cooked one at that. However, on the positive side of things, low expectation really helped me to enjoy the film, and I even watched it a second time to check over some initial reactions I had. There is still a lot to enjoy here. Acting is of a high standard (Ifans' performance as Curt Connors gets better on repeat viewings), with good chemistry generated between Stone and Garfield, the effects work is (obviously) better ten years on; something which gives us a better-more acrobatic-moving Spider-Man, while the whole make-up of Parker as a geek who becomes cocky, even arrogant, really adds a kick to the first half of the movie's coming-of-age narrative bent. It's also good that with a running time of over two hours the makers have the time to expand Peter as a character, making the audience wait with expectation of his life changing date with the spider. As for the villain, it's true enough to say that The Lizard is hardly an inspiring choice, but it does fit in with the whole origin story plan that Webb and his team want to tell. Though it should be noted that those seeking wall to wall fights between Spidey and The Liz are going to go a little hungry. It's big on human story and not the lazy cash in movie it could have been, and undeniably it's fun, but the holes, dangling threads and logic leaps stop it breaking out to achieve its intentions. Looking forward to the sequel, mind¬Ö 7/10","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","bkrauser-81-311064","4 July 2012","The Amazing Spider-Man tries to recreate and remold the titular hero but does so with diminishing results. Like a radically different cover of an old standard tune, the notes are different but the words are essentially the same. A crazed villain still tries to wreak havoc on the city, Uncle Ben still dies, and the love story is still left unfinished and open ended. There are of course differences but they don't have enough flair or pop to really stand out.It has been only five years since the last installment of the Raimi trilogy and it seems that the principle lesson the studio learned from Spider-Man 3 was don't give the director too much freedom. Sam Raimi's pop sensibilities and ego admittedly got the better of him resulting in disaster. So to compensate for Sam Raimi's too much muchness, they got very green director Marc Webb (of 500 Days of Summer fame) willing to play by the rules at least for now.There were aspects of the film I did like. Much of the impetus of the story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of Peter's parents which brought new elements to the story. Spider-Man comes home with multiple scabs, bruises and welts from the night's action which is much more realistic when you're leading a life of a crime fighter. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was an instantly likable character as was her no nonsense police commissioner father played by Denis Leary. Emma Stone is one of those lucky, popular young actresses who can find universal recognition and praise. She has multiple sides to her which shines in the majority of her performances and makes her incredibly likable. Had the movie been about her I might have actually enjoyed it much more.Which brings me to probably the biggest complaint I have about The Amazing Spider-Man. I do not like Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man. Not at all. At 28 the actor looks too old to be in high school and much too good looking to be the nerdy, mild-mannered Peter Parker he should be. Once in the suit, he spends an awful lot of time without his mask; likely so people will be distracted by the fact that the costume makes him look like a deflated Voight basketball with legs.There are those who would argue that this Spider-Man is closer to the smartalecky, brilliant young genius from the comic books. I respectfully disagree. I question whether such praise is deserved when he impresses Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans) by looking him up on Google then regurgitating what he has read to gain notice. He then further impresses Dr. Connors by giving him the algorithm he needs even though he actually found it in his dad's briefcase and didn't actually come up with it on his own. Then there's the webslingers which I suppose were ingenious until you consider he only invented the mechanism to shoot his webbing. He actually took the cartridges creating the web itself from Oscorp. Oh and then there's the scene where he leaves behind a bulky camera with the words ""property of Peter Parker"" printed on it for The Lizard to find. Yeah not exactly the makings of a genius here.And what of The Lizard? The fact is the character is ultimately treated as inconsequential. An almost compulsory character thrown in because every superhero must have a super villain. His motivations are tenuous at best and nothing in his scenes while transformed really leave an impact. Also as an aside, the New York water filtration systems seem to have an awful lot of exotic looking lizards and great phone reception. Someone should really check into that.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","zetes","11 November 2012","A re-boot of a series that only started a decade ago, and ended just five years ago. As such, it feels unnecessary and probably a tad rushed. It has to go through all that origin story stuff again, and, in my opinion, that's almost always what kills comic book movies, especially ones where I'm already familiar with the origin story (Batman Begins, despite being very well liked, has never worked for me either for the very same reason). It also doesn't help that James Garfield, who has proved himself a really fine actor elsewhere, feels weak as Peter Parker. He just never seems like he could be a super hero. Tobey Maguire really surprised me as being capable in the role, but Garfield doesn't. The film does get better as it goes on, especially after the super-villain, the Lizard, is created (played by Rhys Ifans). Before the classic accident that turns him into the Lizard, Ifans is kind of dull, but the actual Lizard monster is truly an imposing villain and actually kind of frightening. The action sequences are pretty good, though both Spider-Man and the Lizard are CGI creation. It thus amounts to simply watching cartoons fight, but it's well done for what it is. Emma Stone has good presence as the girlfriend, Gwen Stacy. Dennis Leary plays her father. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Sheen's good when he's around, but Field has no presence as Aunt May.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","thescribe7","2 June 2015","As cringe worthy as Tobey Maguire is, you always like him at the end of the day. As cheesy as the original film is, it has a heart and a comic book feel. We felt something during Uncle Ben's speech in the original film. In this film, it is merely glossed over to something that's supposed to add up to more or less the same thing. Also, doesn't anybody ever poke an eye at Peter during all the great powers he has? Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man is perhaps more fitting but he's just missing something. He doesn't have the corny comic book feel to him in this film. I guess this is a more ""serious"" version of the Raimi film but there is no substance here. You have a giant lizard running around doing nothing interesting. Everything that relates to Spider-Man just feels glossed over. I don't even think we find out anything about Uncle Ben's killer. We never see him again! Peter isn't even responsible for anything! There is no guilt felt! There are some subplots in here that don't amount much to anything. To the film's credit, they sure did pull off a better love interest for Peter. Gwen is cute and an actual character. I also do feel like Peter is almost more relatable here. Him and Gwen do process chemistry and are cute. But sometimes we need a bit comic book to it. Or something to it. Something like a story. As stupid looking as the Green Goblin looked in the original film you remember him for his cheesy lines. He was at least a character! This lizard dude is nothing! The film fails to add anything new to the Spider-Man mythos and you forget most of it by a year. Where's those little warm feelings you get when Spider-Man kisses M J for the first time (as bad as her character is)? The film is not memorable nor does it have a warm spider heart. It just feels like your average mediocre movie. Putting comparisons aside, there really is nothing here to marvel at. Peter is likable enough but nothing that special. Nothing special in that there's no character development. He starts fighting and stuttering and ends fighting and stuttering! But the Stan Lee cameo was cool...","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","s-satheesh94","1 July 2012","Hi All, First I am a huge fan of Spidey but what this movie does is making us hate Spider-Man. Marc Webb you are good at directing love stories but you lack a lot in Action oriented movies like Spider-Man.I have a lot of questions after seeing the movie.1)Why there is no proper details shown for the disappearance of Peter parker's parents? 2)Why the movie looks so dark always and almost all the scenes were shot in night? Is Spidey afraid of daylight Mark Webb?3)I didn't see any one writing about the Spider-Man Suit, How did they miss it? The suit looks so bad and it doesn't fit good for andrew garfield. It looks kind of cheap and the design looks awkward. The Sam Raimi version of spiderman had a really awesome suit and looked believable. What made you change the Suit Webb? 4)The changes that occur to peter after the spider bite was not shown as enjoyable as Sam Raimi's version in this movie. 5)The huge disappointment is the Lizard.Its kind of laughable when the lizard speaks. The CG is not good. 6)The3D effect was below average and it is good at some places. 7)The cast is good and I really liked Andrew Garfield as peter parker but not as Spider-Man. All the other characters were good in acting.8)Why Garfield is always taking his mask off. The great thing about the Spider-Man character is the mask and its annoying to see Garfield taking off his mask quite often. 9)Sam Raimi is good in Action as well as in Emotion scenes but here Mark Webb falls down. There is no good action scenes in the first half and the most likable scene is the fight with the lizard and the last Spider-Man web swing scene. It was really good in 3D. 10)This movie doesn't give the satisfaction that Sam Raimi's trilogy gave and this looks kind of waste. Why they go for the decision to make a reboot? they could have done Spider-Man 4. 11)It is really boring and all the scenes remind Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man movie. 12)Huge disappointment and it doesn't look like a super hero movie after it ends. Can see this movie only once for 3D effects. 13)I am sure that Columbia and Marvel will be thinking of getting Sam Raimi back or any other good director. But Mark webb has also done a good job in directing this huge movie in this critical situation. But he has missed a lot in satisfying Spidey fans. Sorry Webb better luck next time. 14) Music is so bad and at some places it is good. Where is the background score in this movie and i can barely remember any music. The music in Sam Raimi's Trilogy is fantastic but this one sucks.15)Hope the sequel will be a great one with some good CG, new and powerful Villain, good Spider Suit, good story and with some really good action sequences.Thanks for reading.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","punch87","21 February 2019","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" plays things agonizingly safe, and while the film isn't without a heartbeat, its failure to take any chances keeps it from flight.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","punch87","13 January 2019","The Amazing Spider-Man reboot didn't arrive with the kind of media circus that the masked vigilante is accustomed to on the streets of NYC. Instead it quietly spun a solid, intricate plot in a corner left abandoned for the past five-years and waited patiently for the buzz to begin. Once word gets out, Marc Webb's Spidey will be swarmed: this is the spandex-clad saviour no one knew they needed.Sure the quips aren't as quotable as The Avengers, or the action as big-balled and sprawling, but there's a real story there and an emotional trajectory that forces you to care. Happy 50th Birthday, Spider-Man. The Brit who got bit, actor Andrew Garfield, is superb as the skater boi meets science nerd turned webslinger. He starts out as an updated outsider, popping contact lenses until he stumbles upon his father's specs in a briefcase that propels him on a journey to discover the fate of his folks.Square specs on and the high school image is complete, with Gwen Stacy (played by an endearing Emma Stone) making the opening act look straight from the pages of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's own Amazing Spider-Man circa '65. Gwen is Peter Parker's intellectual equal, number one in her class if you ask her, excelling as his squeeze and making Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane appear shallow for falling for the hero first, boy second. ""I've been bitten,"" Peter tells a wide-eyed Gwen, ""Me too,"" comes the sincere reply.Their first kiss succeeds in rivalling the memorable peanut smuggling, upside down antics of the Sam Raimi original and delivers a very real and passionate clinch (with webbing). You can practically hear the hormones firing and sparking. She's effortlessly likeable, a honey trap for fans that are bound to feel a creeping dread the deeper the character gets into the franchise. It's billed as the 'untold story' and manages to cover new ground whilst putting a fresh spin on the cornerstones of Spidey's origin. The radioactive arachnid lurks in a lab at Oscorp where Peter's search for the parentals winds up.Here we're introduced to Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who's working on a formula that can regrow limbs (including his own absent appendage) and ultimately make everyone equal. It's a noble ambition and one that easily gets out of control, fluidly slipping into danger territory once the experiment goes awry and he becomes a giant city lizard. Ifans plays the tragic antagonist with subtlety, teasing the would-be father figure role before his descent into full-blown, green tinged madness. This scientific development marks a huge breakthrough in villainy that leaves the Lokis of the world looking around wildly for a better excuse. The film is by no means flawless, though.The CGI rendering of the Lizard really is as awful as you suspected it might be. Police Captain George Stacy sums up the incredulity we feel with a curt, ""Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?"" You never quite believe the monster is there in the scene rather than in a computer and his booming voice is too over-the-top evil to be taken seriously. Step away from the microphone and snarl or something, Rhys.There's also an unnecessary nod to the comics when he shrugs on the shredded lab coat for the final showdown and engages in fighting talk that teeters uncomfortably on cringe. Even Spidey's wisecracks misfire when he starts pounding on a car thief, kicking off a running commentary that Iron Man should have given him pointers on. Elsewhere, the script is much slicker and succeeds in spinning a yarn that will have you displaying genuine concern for the main players, and even the fate of some bit-part ones. Martin Sheen makes a wonderful Uncle Ben and he's given some great material to work with, whilst Sally Field's calm and confrontation-skirting Aunt May balances the guardian double act.Much like the original venture, The Amazing Spider-Man takes its time developing the characters so that by the time Peter gets in his first sticky situation, you definitely give a damn. Incidentally, the scenes where his spidey senses kick in are some of the best in the film, adding humour that the Tobey Maguire version lacked as he grapples with his newfound super strength; slamming doors never looked so satisfying.This reboot also corrects what irked so many the first time around: those web-shooters. True to the comics, Peter has manufactured his own artificial weapons loaded with super-strong adhesive. The fact they are artificial rather than organic also gives him a weakness, which every good superhero needs. The whole shebang was captured in stereoscopic 3D rather than a shoddy post-conversion and if any superhero was going to suit this medium, it was always going to be Spidey. He shoots from one corner of the screen to a truck to a crane leaving us suspended, 60-storeys up in downtown New York and in awe of the view.The city makes an exhilarating backdrop for his urban ballet and seems much more grimy Gotham than The Daily Bugle's usual technicolour beat. Patriotic parades and daytime adventures are traded for back alley brawls, gunfire and those graffitied arachnids that form part of Spidey's viral marketing campaign, on and off film. Thanks to this stellar retelling, Andrew Garfield's spin will be going global.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","bonzybino","6 July 2012","The Amazing Spiderman doesn't quite live up to be an amazing reboot of the franchise! But its a good one time watch, and probably lovable for those who got fed up with the Sam raimi - toby maguire Spiderman trilogy.. To be fair, The Amazing Spiderman might be close to the plots in comics, Ha! but then the rebooted comics version isn't a good reason to reboot an already successful movie series. Dejavu when you get to see too many scenes so identical to the 2002 film, understandably all grown from the same roots, hmm and like many, i strongly believe the reboot version was a bit early to be made..Some better things, however, worth mentioning : the pretty Emma stone who is much better than Kirsten Dunst ( don't give a darn whether its Gwen or Mary Jane, they are meant to be Spiderman's Lady love anyways). A strong villain in Dr.Lizard, thanks to good CGI (poor characterization and casting though) and finally Music composed By James Horner. Andrew Garfield is cute - a good leap from ""The Social Network"" - but isn't quite the lovable Peter Parker we know.The script, the dialogues and the closing lines were all lacking the firepower and the emotional vibrancy, just to make a comparison, the voice-over of Tobey's Spiderman(With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift, my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-man.) still gives me the flare, which sadly is a huge miss with the rebooted movie. Memories afresh how I got crazy with Spider-Man(2002) during my schooldays!! hmm, The Amazing Spider-Man never comes close. 6/10","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","SPZMaxinema","6 April 2022","Andrew Garfield was not a convincing Peter Parker and the villain's plan was really dumb, not to mention the hideous-looking suit (and I get it, it's an origin story but still). There were some good moments but it by no means saved the movie from being a let down. Even though this was meant to improve the hero's story and portrayal over the Raimi movies, it just ended up making those movies look better. Andrew Garfield didn't really shine as Spider-Man until the end of Amazing Spider-Man 2 and No Way Home in my opinion.","9/10"

In fact, to me, it is way better than the 3 previous ones. It is more faithful to the comics and Andrew Garfield makes a better Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. Too bad some of the special effects are not up to what was available in 2012.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","LW-08854","26 December 2023","A new fresh take on the spider-man story. Looking at some of the positives compared to the 2002 version, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone had natural chemistry and Garfield as Spider-Man was a fine choice, with more jokes, truer to the comics. His wiry frame also worked visually as Spider-Man. The special effects are obviously a lot sharper and more realistic than the CGI from 2002 which does look a bit dated now. Emma Stone dances circles around Dunst when she's acting and Gwen's character has far more depth and life than MJ.One negative I thought was that the portrayal of Uncle Ben and Aunt May wasn't as good as the Sam Raimi version and the back story with his parents didn't do much for me, Aunt May is more or less written out of the second half of this film.In contrast to the 2002 version the film switches the focus of Peter's emotional relationship from his Aunt to his girlfriend. Maguire's 2002 portrayal of Peter comes across almost sexless at points, it isn't great for a superhero to be scared of women. When Peter tells MJ at the end he only wants to be friends, Only a friend?"" she asks?. ""That's all I have to give,"" Maguire says....hmmmm. In this version (2012) the chemistry between Peter and Gwen is a little more suggestive, they are meant to be real teenagers after all, not just asexual characters in a kids film, superhero films are no longer made for little children anymore but basically for adolescents and adults these days, The Amazing Spider-Man gets this aspect right.The film made the correct choice by just picking a single villain and giving enough time to develop his story, something the sequel failed to learn from. The music from James Horner complimented the film well too (His last finished work). I think my favourite scene was when Spider-Man saves the boy on the bridge, a point where we see the kind side to Spider-Man's as he gently reassurances the boy in danger. Take note Man of Steel, superheroes need to be protecting and saving people not letting thousands die.","3/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Aaron1375","9 July 2012","I enjoyed the first three Spider-man films immensely even the highly scorned third film. So I was not to sure what to think about a reboot to a still young franchise. However, I just realized that Sam Rami is not Spider-man's creator, that there are thousands of stories and ways to portray Spider-man so why keep us waiting fifteen or twenty years for another film? There is no reason at all, I want to see Spider-man on the big screen and honestly while the first three Spider-man films were enjoyable this portrayal of Spider-man is the more accurate. Does it follow the comic book exactly...well of course not. No comic film does that, why is it even necessary? Sam Rami gave Spider-man organic shooters, bypassed Gwen Stacy in lieu of Mary Jane, and had Sandman kill Uncle Ben...so yes, the formula did not match the comic the first time, so why now or ever? This film seemed to be a combination of the original Spider-man that first appeared in the 60's and Ultimate Spider-man which launched either in the late 90's or early 2000's. And the match up worked and now if they wish to continue the success they need to continue the story in an interesting way and not let it end as badly as the third Spider-man film ended without a resolution.This story is an origin tale, so you know the basics without me going into details. Those not familiar with the ultimate story arc may be confused about certain things such as Peter knowing his parents and things of this nature. The main thing that is different though is the villain as we finally get the Lizard. You also get to see Peter learn to use his powers a bit more here than in the first film. It is not quite the smooth transition. He soon begins fighting crime which leads him to having to try and capture the Lizard. The Lizard has plans of his own though.Things this movie did that the previous films did not do are plentiful. Do not get me wrong, this one was not as good as the second Spider-man film, I am just saying they did the Spider powers better. They also had the web shooters, even when I was at my most negative about this film from the first trailers I salivated over Spidey finally using mechanical web shooters. They also had him move like a spider more. During a fight with a lizard the way he entangled the lizard in the web was very spider-like. They also had a scene where he shot multiple webs in the sewer and used the vibrations to try and locate the Lizard. This Spider-man also wisecracks and constantly talks during battles, another trait missing from the previous entries. So all in all this Spidey was more like the Spidey I know from the comics.The villain is the Lizard and while I enjoyed how they integrated him in the origin plot there was a problem I had with him. Mainly that it was not explained that he could telepathically communicate with other reptiles. I knew why there were so many lizards and such present, but for those not familiar with the character there may be confusion. Just as in his motivations. When fully transformed he hates humans and wishes reptiles ruled the world, while this comes across a bit in the film I read a review where the person questioned his motivations and how he became evil so quick. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was great, much cuter than Kristen Dunst and looking more like the character she was portraying. I thought her and James had good chemistry and I liked how their romance was not simply he pining for her.Finally, I want to cover one thing that this movie did that I was so happy when a certain something did not occur. That is Gwen did not get taken by the villain and Spider-man did not have to rescue her! I was so certain this would happen, but to my surprise and delight it did not. Sorry, but Mary Jane being kidnapped at the end of all three of the first films was a bit monotonous. I swear the makers of this film felt this too as it looked like Lizard was going from her and then he just gets what he was coming for and leaves her in the room. Leaving me to think the makers were like ""Gotcha! Ha, thought she was going to be taken for the final confrontation didn't ya?"" So this film was a nice restart, though I do hope they film the movies quicker and get in a good three or four films in and have a complete story done. The first series was good, but it did not end all that well as there were still a number of things left in the air. This one has set up a good beginning and hinted at a future villain in the upcoming films. I believe if all goes well the next film could be the best one yet, but let me reiterate if all goes well. And should they complete this set of movies I would want for them to reboot once again. I love Spider-man and want to see him on the big screen...however, I am good on origin stories so you can at least skip that next time.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","CinemaClown","11 October 2013","When Sony Pictures decided to reboot the Spider-Man franchise, I wondered if there really was a need for it considering that not much time had passed since Spider-Man 3 came out & overall, this franchise hadn't fared as worse as others to justify a reboot. Anyway, The Amazing Spider-Man tries to bring on screen the story of our friendly neighbourhood from its origins. Everyone must already be aware of the premise but in case you're not, it tells the story of Peter Parker & how he became Spider-Man in addition to an ugly, stupid villain thrown in here who is more funny (unintentionally, obviously) than scary. Director Marc Webb tries very hard to take his movie away from Sam Raimi's versions but it ends up with too many similarities in events, much less charm or excitement & is a dumbed down version of the original Spider-Man movie in a new package. Plus, the romantic arc between Peter Parker & Gwen Stacy is just absurd & eye-rollingly cheesy. Cinematography is more oriented to point-of-view shots while editing is just horrible. Visual effects feel incomplete & the music by James Horner is simply no match to Danny Elfman's magnificent score that actually feels like belonging to Spider-Man.Coming to the performances, Andrew Garfield is very much believable in the costume of Spider-Man & does a brilliant job in portraying the recklessness of a teenager in possession of newly discovered superpowers. Emma Stone is a darling as Gwen Stacy but she isn't given much to play with yet manages to tag along with a fine performance. Rest of the cast is simply forgettable. Also, Irrfan Khan's ""pivotal role"" was; to be used as the poster boy for the film's marketing in India, which actually paid off as this movie had a record-breaking opening here.Now those who are still reading this review & are unfortunately fans of this film, few of them might argue that I should not compare this film with the original Spider-Man but if that's the case then what exactly was the point of making this film if it never was going to be better than its decade old version anyway? On an overall scale, adding nothing but only a new dimension (3D) which had its little moments, The Amazing Spider-Man isn't amazing at all & is just no match to Raimi's versions, which are more fun even today. In short, a needless reboot whose needless sequel is coming soon. Good luck, Sony Pictures.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","reb-warrior","12 March 2013","If you're like me, you may have heard that Spider-man was being rebooted, and that they were basically telling the origin story all over again. Well I thought, wait what, but I just saw the origin story!? The Sam Raimi version! What's the point in watching this, and decide not to watch it. Well guess what? You're making a mistake! Tho this is an origin story, with similar elements, it's very different, and something completely new. Yes, Peter Parker does become Spider-man. Yes he does grow up with his aunt and uncle. But that's about all that is the same, and even in these two cases, the ""how"" and ""why"" are different.OK, you may see me make a few comparisons with the Raimi version. Sorry. But it's only because I think some people may not bother watching this because they feel they've already seen it. Just to be clear I really like the first Raimi movie, and the second, tho not as much. The third, not at all.In the Raimi version I found Peter to be an absolute geek. Period. He was always feeling sorry for himself, and had no confidence whatsoever until he got his powers. He was also a complete outcast at school. So much so, that he seems depressed and almost reminds me of one of those kids that was bullied and brings a gun to school. So we're relieved when he gets his powers and we cheer for him. In this new telling we see a Peter Parker whom is geeky, yet cool and likable. Cute and funny even. He has lots of confidence, and doesn't seem like an absolute outcast. His interaction with the lead female character may be a little shy, but not over-the-top uncomfortable as in Raimi's version. This Peter also thinks fast on his feet and has a lot of witty lines combined with his body language(as Spider-man) that really emphasizes Peter's comical wit that you see in the comics and the animated TV shows.Raimi's Peter was all wrapped up in Mary Jane, his tormented feelings of guilt for his uncle's death, and his uncle's message. In this version Peter is focused on finding out what happened to his parents. Something very mysterious, almost a cover-up or conspiracy took place. He's doing this before he gets his powers. We watch as he sleuths, putting together his memories, a file that belonged to his father, and uses the internet to track down information. The mystery brings hims face to face with Dr. Curt Connors aka: The Lizard. The way it goes down that Peter becomes Spider-man, and his uncle's death, is very different here than in the Raimi version. Both are really good. In both, uncle Ben's death is very sad. Do I have a preference? Yes. I liked this version better. Mostly I liked the circumstances better here. In Raimi's version, sorry, but Pete seemed like a total douche-bag with the whole wrestling/money thing. I believe the wrestling version is also the comic book version, but nevertheless that's how I felt. In this version, what happened, just made more sense, even relatable, and fit more in line with Peter's personality. Oh where, oh where is Mary Jane coz she always needs rescuing? She's always falling from a building or a super-villain has got her! Wow, wow, wow, what a difference with Gwen Stacey! She didn't need rescuing! I liked her right away. She's intelligent, and I loved that she began crushing on Peter BEFORE he got his powers. Without giving anything away, there is this moment where she and Peter are talking. He has a secret which concerns her. Not love stuff, OK. Something else. I'm thinking, oh no, just tell her, she really needs to know this. But guess what? She figures it out herself. As I watched I felt relieved that she wasn't walking away from Peter with the impression that he's a lousy person. She knew the truth. I really liked her and Peter together. Great chemistry with the actors.One thing that really struck me in this movie was today's techy world. Peter using his cellphone for communication, messages, and pictures. Him calling his voice-mail to hear his uncle's last message a couple of times. Gulp. How many of us have loved ones that have passed, and we saved their last voice-mail message? The last thing they said to us, their voice, means so much. It's a part of our social culture now. I loved the way they used this.I've always wondered about Peter's parents. I'm not an avid comic reader or anything, but every now and then I'd read one. I never read anything about them, tho it may have been written, I dunno, but the ones I've read were always Peter that grew up with his aunt and uncle, and never any explanation as to why. I found this origin story a tightly-knit, well acted, well rounded tale with a twist at the end, that leaves me looking forward to the next movie. I'm curious to see how this mystery unravels.So, if you haven't watched this because you think it's the same story as the Raimi version, let me clarify, it's not the Spider-man you think it is, and it's terrific!","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","aesgaard41","30 January 2013","You just can't review this movie without comparing it the to Tobey McGuire-Sam Raimi trilogy that gave birth to it. Sam Raimi already created the special effects and style that helped make Spiderman a movie character so it wasn't that hard for someone else to come in and slide on the work already done there. What I don't like about the new movie is that Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is a young jerk. I really don't see Peter Parker stealing a security badge, sneaking into a secure scientific lab, antagonizing Flash Thompson, alienating his Uncle Ben nor mocking a car thief. If anything, Garfield's Spiderman like Christian Bale's Batman talks too much. The best part of the first movies was its believability, something that was sort of missing in the third movie and is definitely missing in this installment. (The scene with Peter discovering his superhuman strength is nothing but slapstick and looks out of place with the rest of the movie.) Now let's get to the new suit. It looks horrible!! I had a hard time accepting Tobey's Peter could create the costume he wore, and I have an even harder time accepting the new costume (much less that Garfield's Peter could even get the material!). It just looks horrible! In the dark, the red and blue colors run together and look purple. Even worse, Garfield looks horrible in it. The first bright version had a muscular body suit under it; the new version has nothing. About the only thing this movie has is better chemistry between its stars. I really had a hard time buying Kirsten Dunst as a high school kid, but Emma Stone really sparkles as Gwen Stacy and really blows the former ""Interview With a Vampire"" actress out of the water. That's basically where ""Amazing Spiderman"" (Spiderman 4?) works best. The story between Peter and Gwen takes center stage, but Rhys Ifan, possibly best known as Captain Hook from the Peter Pan prequel, works well too; his right arm is digitally removed with the same technology that removed Gary Sinise's legs in ""Forrest Gump."" The problem is the villain's story as the subplot takes up too much screen time. It was handled great in the first two movies, overdone in the third movie and extremely noticeable in this movie. It just takes too long getting into the plot. What bothers me most is the unnecessary reboot to Peter's origin. Do we really need to make Peter that much more tragic by over-emphasizing the reasons why he was left with Uncle Ben and Aunt May. I have nothing again Martin Sheen or Sally Field in the roles, in fact, they share just about the same amount of wonderful chemistry as Garfield and Stone, but there's too much exposition here to a movie where we already know who the characters are. I also can't stand the fact that the movie is a reboot; re-inventing his origin and chopping out whole chunks of it, and what's this thing about the mystery of his past? What mystery? He was left with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. End of mystery. Bottom line: Amazing Spiderman is passable, but Sam Raimi with his familiarity to the subject already pulled it off, and we've seen it before. We've seen everything before. The only new thing is the chemistry between Garfield and Stone, but is that all it takes to make us believe this movie is superior to all the hard work Sam Raimi already did? The hard work was already done; this movie is just sliding forward on the momentum. Take this movie back in time to BEFORE Spider-Man 1 and then I'll say it outdoes the original, but then, that would make the original not so original, wouldn't it?","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","zeeshan762001","19 June 2012","I watched this movie last night at a pre-release screening. It was my first time watching any movie before release. So, I was a bit doubtful about it.BUT I WAS AMAZED at how good this movie turned out to be! I personally believe that it's the best of all Spiderman movies. It was packed with emotions, action, brilliant CGI, and a fair bit of humour. I must admit that the Spiderman role suited Andrew Garfield and I would love to see him in this role in future movies. It was amazing in 3D and I would advise watching it in 3D.I am not going into any details. Just watch it and you would see for yourself. And DO NOT PAY ATTENTION to any of the bad reviews here.All in all, A Must See.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","jiou_bajiet","19 January 2022","I do not dispute that many people really did not fully like Sam Raimi's film ""Spider-Man 3"", but our favorite actors, led by Tobey Maguire, took part in it, the special effects were as always on top, and not to say that the plot was completely bad. But it seemed to the studio that it was necessary to rethink the franchise with a new cast of performers. Mark Webb was invited to the post of director and filming of the ""New Spider-Man"" began.The image of Peter Parker, or the Spider-Man himself, was tried on by Andrew Garfield, and we meet him in high school. Peter is a very smart and quite interesting guy, he could easily be cool, but he tries not to shine and do what he likes. The hero even strikes up a friendship with the charming Gwen Stacy, but this is not exactly a romantic story. Then there will be something tougher.""The New Spider-Man"" may not be the most ideal movie, but it looks interesting and is able to make us worry about the characters and the current situation. When you care about what's going on with the plot, it means the movie is not bad at all.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","jagooch","13 July 2023","The movie feels like they added a plot after coming up with the special effects. It checks the boxes of the expected plot points, but the acting and character development are non-existent. The movie doesn't give you a reason to care about the main characters, so you are left with just enjoying the special effects or taking a nap.Emma Stone looks nothing like Mary Jane from the comics, and doesn't have a believable character arc. She goes from not liking to loving Peter Parker for no apparent reason. I guess it had to happen for the plot to move forward, but it does not happen in a convincing manner.My advice is to watch the original movies or , even better, read the comics.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","MLDinTN","8 March 2013","Sorry, but this movie was horrible compared to Toby Mcguire's first Spiderman. I loved that Spiderman movie; it was funny and had a great story. In this remake, it's not funny and everything in it has been seen before. And Andrew Garfield goes around with his hair sticking up and just wasn't good casting. The way Peter Parker finds out about his super powers was no where near as good. And this movie copy cats so much from the first, like having Ben die, how he designs the spidey suit, how he gets back at the bully at school. And all of it was done worse in this film than the first one.FINAL VERDICT: I'm so glad I waited till this was on cable so I didn't pay to watch it. I recommend watching the Toby Mcguire ones and staying away from this.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","fortnitegamerk","25 March 2022","The Amazing Spider Man 1 is better than the second one and it is not close at all. I enjoyed the opening of Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man and his Peter Parker. His Peter Parker was the best in this movie. The way he acts like a spider in this movie considers him to be one of the best spider-man, if not the best. Gwen Stacy was excellent as well. The building of Dr Conners and all of the science stuff made me like it more. I loved his fighting scenes with the lizard.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","arijit-pritamzoro","29 June 2012","i'm giving this movie 7 out of 10 because of it's action sequence and amazing spider man swing but it's having faults in lot of places.in the last spider man movie i saw exactly the same problems this movie is having.Action is there but not in details.Emotion was there but not matching up with spider man's aim to finish those who killed his uncle.The largest fault was""THE GREATEST SECRET DIDN'T REVEALED"".THAT'S WHY PICTURE WASN'T CLEAR FOR ME.AND WHAT YOU SAW IN THE TRAILER JUST FORGET ABOUT IT,THEY ARE ALL DELETED SCENES.even peter parker's father's leaving time speech wasn't there.Then spider man conversion wasn't clear too.how his DNA changed after spider biting..or what happened to him physically inside wasn't clear at all.he just converted in his sleep with some blurred dream..it's not at all enough.But yes after that all actions and lizard battle was great to watch.but again some actions weren't in details.3D effects were average.so i'm saying movie was enjoyable.""ONE TIME MUST WATCH"".BUT NOT MORE THAN THAT.here Toby Maguire's spider man won.","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","secondtake","14 July 2012","The Amazing Spiderman (2012)What do you do with a movie that's impeccably well made, acted to the pitch required of a superhero movie with realistic themes, and filled with really fluid wow factors? I mean, this is a really compelling movie on some levels. And if you like these kinds of movies (and there is no shortage of them every year) this is one of the best, technically, and from the point of view of unaffected acting.What no one wants to say or hear in this context is that the movie isn't everything it could be. Or even worse, it's everything that other movies have already been, including earlier Spiderman movies. Marc Webb isn't at fault--he directs with aplomb, and gets the most from the series of action scenes. It's the writers, and the producers who are guiding the writers, who have to take some rap in presenting another movie about the same kind of thing we've seen too too many times. Or at least too too many times for me, for singing praises.But if you don't mind the formula again, you'll be in for a treat. I know I enjoyed it all even so. The swinging through space, the life or death fights with a hugely powerful monster, the last minute race to stop the doomsday device (with a timer to let us know exactly how much suspense lies ahead), the girl who is smart and pretty and actually pretty capable, too. All of this is in place, and well done.Well done. Is that enough? Up to you. It's hardly the kind of movie the invites deep thinking or parsing out the components. It's more the kind of movie to just rush in headlong and enjoy, and drive home thinking about something else.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","3xHCCH","29 June 2012","There were so many reasons why I was ready NOT to like this movie. First of all, the original Sam Raimi-Tobey Maguire trilogy was so recent, and were done very well and did so well also box-office-wise. I did not really feel the need to make this reboot at all, much less, too soon after the ""Spider Man 3."" I was also very leery about the choice of Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider Man. Watching the trailers, I do not know what it was about Garfield's face and body build that did not seem right to be Peter Parker. Anyway, the hype was still really building up, as evidenced by the grand first day showing today in almost 100% of cinemas all over the country. Of course, it was inevitable that my whole family will still go and watch!As it began by telling Peter Parker's high school life, you see that Director Marc Webb was trying so hard to make it different from the first Tobey Maguire movie, and this can be noticed as the movie went along. The story of how Peter was bitten by the super-spider was so far- fetched and unbelievable. The story of how Gwen and Peter became a couple was so rushed. The story of Peter's parents which was what I thought would be a main theme in this movie was hardly tackled in detail at all. Andrew Garfield painted a different Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. Garfield made the role his own by amp-ing up the angst. I have to grant that Andrew was a better dramatic actor than Tobey. His scenes with veteran actors Martin Sheen and Sally Field (as Uncle Ben and Aunt May) were heartfelt and sincere, as with his romantic scenes with Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy). However, he seems to become schizophrenic when he dons his Spider Man costume, as he becomes all too cocky for comfort. Emma Stone acted very well as Gwen Stacy. She was a much better love interest than Kirsten Dunst was as MJ in the first movie. I guess it was because Gwen was written to be smart and courageous, unlike MJ who was nothing more than a mere damsel in distress. Rhys Ifans does an effective departure from his usual comedy roles to play the tragic Dr. Curt Connors. It was just too bad that the story of his descent into Lizard madness was too sudden to be affecting or logical. Admittedly, there were so awesome-looking visual effects in this movie. The cartoony multi-color palette of the Tobey version was replaced by a darker and more serious mood in this one, more fitting into the Marvel canons. Overall though, while the effort was there but the final impact of this film could eventually be forgettable. Even the extra scene in the end credits hinting a second installment was predictable. After watching, all my three kids declared that they liked the Tobey version than this. Ultimately, we still remember the Tobey Maguire films too much for this film to take any serious roots into our memory. Let's see if the next installments will make a difference.","9/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","samarth-sri","18 July 2012","Even though many reviewers are calling this as improvement over Spiderman 1 but I think otherwise. First of the franchise would have done better to make a sequel instead of rebooting everything - with new actors. Since spiderman 3 did not live upto expectations, people started criticizing both Toby & Kirsten. I think they did a pretty good job (even part 3 was not awfully bad). But rebooting doesn't make sense. That too, only after 10yrs. They should have waited another 25-30 yrs for that. Also they should have taken some lessons from the way X-men & Batman franchises have gone. Batman (1989) was possibly the only good movie in batman series and there was plenty of scope for improvement. That's what they did, starting with Batman Begins, Dark Knight & D K Rises (pretty sure it's going to be bigger than Amazing Spiderman, possibly overtake even Avengers). Stronger plot, better acting, better direction, dialogues, action sequences, CGI effects etc. They took it to a whole new level. In case of X-men, they started pretty well with X-men 1,2 but had couple of blunders in between. But they corrected it X-men first class. My first X-men movie was X-men FC which was very likable that I watched all the other ones too. But the need for a prequel of X-men was there. Since Charles Xavier and Magneto had worked together as shown in earlier movies. Spiderman 1 already had almost everything (may be a bit rushed though but so is Amazing SM). If there was anything needed, it was a sequel or a completely new plot not a reboot. At the end of the movie, I felt like it was a nice movie BUT WAS THERE ANY NEED FOR IT ?PS - Some improvements are definitely there but there are some let downs as well, the movie has many scenes rushed into it. BUT I'll prefer Spiderman (2002) over ASM.","9/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","rparham","23 December 2012","It was only ten years ago that Spider-Man, the first cinematic adaptation of one of Marvel's crown jewel characters, was released to generally strong critical notices and boffo box-office. After two additional entries, the 2nd being another hit, the 3rd dropping a bit in quality, Sony Pictures and original helmer Sam Raimi couldn't see eye to eye on future entries, so Raimi walked away, and Sony elected to follow in the footsteps of James Bond and Batman and ""reboot"" the franchise only five years since the last entry. This would prove to be a controversial choice with many (I have at least one friend who said he had no interest in seeing the reboot), but I was willing to give this new entry the benefit of the doubt. In general, I can say I was glad I did. The new entry, titled The Amazing Spider-Man, is a fairly strong film for the most part. Sporting a good turn in the lead by Andrew Garfield and an expanded focus on the relationship between Peter and his first girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, The Amazing Spider-Man manages to vindicate itself from those who might doubt it.The Amazing Spider-Man does re-hash the origin story that most are probably familiar with at this point, albeit with some new twists on the material. In this incarnation, Peter Parker is left with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) under mysterious circumstances by his parents in the middle of the night in the opening scenes of the film. When the narrative jumps forward to the present, Peter is a gawky outsider, imagined as both a science nerd but also a bit of a teenage rebel, riding a skateboard and slightly flaunting authority. When he discovers a briefcase of his father's in the basement, Peter begins asking questions about his father's work, which leads him to Oscorp, the company his father worked for. There, he encounters Dr. Chuck Connors (Rhys Ifans), his father's former partner, and the two begin working to complete Peter's father's work. However, the research into genetic regeneration has a dark side, as it would appear that it is intended to be used by Norman Osborne, the unseen head of the company, as a tool to help save his life, and who seems to know something about the reason Peter's parents disappeared.Upon his first visit to Oscorp, Peter happens into a room where testing is being performed on spiders, and one manages to bite him. The result, of course, is that the spider bite imbues him with extraordinary powers: strength, speed and a remarkable ability to scale buildings as if his hands and feet had tape bonded to them. After Uncle Ben is killed in an accidental shooting, Peter begins to use these abilities, along with a formula for advanced webbing his father developed, to search out the criminal responsible for Ben's death. Peter begins to expand his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), a classmate who is also an intern at Oscorp. He also begins to wonder about Dr. Connors, who is acting strangely and, when faced with the shutdown of his research, injects himself with the genetic formula, transforming himself into a creature that becomes known as the Lizard, and this experience sends him on a path to madness that Peter must try to stop.The biggest weaknesses of The Amazing Spider-Man are, unsurprisingly, the revisiting of the same material that was brought to life 10 years ago. Most audience members are familiar with the spider bite, the moments of Peter discovering his powers, and his hunt for Ben's killer. It also doesn't help that in the years since the release of the first Spider-Man, countless other super hero film adaptations have seen the light of day and mined similar material. At this juncture, the origin story plot has really started to show both its age and its overexposure. That being said, The Amazing Spider-Man does approach most of these moments in a different vein than the prior entry. A key difference is to focus on Peter's budding relationship with Gwen Stacy, Peter's first girlfriend in the comics but a character that was relegated to cameo status in Spider-Man 3. Garfield and Stone bring a degree of chemistry and involvement to the relationship and this element of the film feels stronger than the Peter/Mary Jane pairing in the earlier films.Garfield also proves a capable lead in the role of Peter. While Tobey Maguire largely focused on portraying Peter as a somewhat shy nerd, for lack of a better term, Garfield's performance enhances Peter's nervousness and captures the awkwardness of the teenage years, stammering in his dialogue at times and giving Peter a degree of uncertainty in his moments with Gwen. It isn't necessarily better than Maguire's turn, but it is sufficiently different to not feel like a rehash. Stone proves a bit more fetching and strong willed than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane, and her realization of Gwen is certainly the stronger female presence when compared to Dunst.The Amazing Spider-Man also excels on the technical front. The visual effects that bring the action sequences to life are impressive, to say the least, and the film benefits from the decade of development in technology since the first Spider-Man. The moments in which Spider-Man soars through the city and faces off against the Lizard are eye-opening, and prove viscerally involving. James Horner's music score is also a standout, providing a fairly traditional symphonic score in a day and age where so many films are moving towards a sound design influenced musical environment.There is no denying that The Amazing Spider-Man arrives with quite a bit of baggage attached, and it isn't completely successful at slaying all of the downfalls of revisiting this material, but for the most part, this entry works, and proves, like 1998's The Incredible Hulk, that there is more than one decent modern interpretation of a traditional comic book hero.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","diongram","17 July 2012","I recently decided to watch ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" hoping to see a decent adventure now in summer and expecting an even better point of view than the previous movies of Raimi. Well, Spiderman... was not so amazing after all.At first, I will start with a reference at the cast. I didn't know Andrew Garfield (Spiderman) to be honest, and I was unsure about his acting skills. My instinct was right after all. His playing was more like a teenager getting excited to be a mutant hero and the sense of reality was nowhere to be found. It was like he wanted it and it happened. No convincing about his feelings in his act. The rest of the cast apart from Martin Sheen, of course, and a surprisingly good Emma Stone, as the romance person in the movie, was not something special.About the script and directing now. i didn't like it. OK, standard special effects we see in every movie like this, some mildly impressing scenes etc. But, the story WAS MISSING. A lot of loose ends, in fact we learned few things about Peter Parker. The director was more eager to show as how cool was Spiderman that he forgot to show us how he became Spiderman. And here it is Garfield's fault too. He wasn't convincing in his emotions, it was like a super-wow phase it happened to him and he enjoyed it rather than a drastic change in his body and mind and the consequences. My thought is Maguire was better. And the script and cast of the first Spiderman movie, which we can compare with, is better.To sum up, the movie was way below the expectations. A lot of plot gaps, unconvincing acting (mainly from the protagonist) and very limited action are the main points which indicate that you should see the movie only as a last minute choice in the drought of the summer (as I did).","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","TheHonestCritic","28 November 2021","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (2012), why does this ""movie"" exist? No really, why did they make this ""film""? This is yet another worthless and pathetic excuse for a cash-grab. Seriously, the only reason that they made this ""movie"" was to put money in their pockets. Now, I could be wrong about that, but I would be very surprised if I was. This ""film"", just like most other movie reboots/remakes, is entirely pointless. It's easily one of the top ten worst reboots/remakes that I have ever seen. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has a predictable and boring storyline, standard to terrible acting, and a generic cliched soundtrack to attempt to tie this diarrhea stain together. The plot is, a teenager gets bitten by a genetically-enhanced super spider and becomes the superhero Spider-Man. Yes, it follows the exact same storyline as ""Spider-Man"" (2002), but with slight alterations. If you've seen the 2002 movie, then you've seen this pile of filth. It's like they took the script from the 2002 film, copied and pasted it, then just made some slight changes to try and make it a different movie. Which of course, they failed miserably! The biggest differences are: Spider-Man doesn't fight the Green Goblin in this ""film"", he fights Lizard instead. Also, his girlfriend is not Mary Jane this time, it's Gwen Stacy. Other than those two changes, it's exactly the same premise as the 2002 film. It's 136 minutes in length, but it feels like an eternity. Why? Because, it's dull and boring! For the most part, next to nothing of substance happens. As for the acting, it's just as terrible as the story. The majority of the cast does an abysmal job with their performances here. Especially Andrew Garfield! The sad thing is, he plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man himself, the main character. What a huge casting mistake that was. Andrew Garfield is one of the worst actors of all-time, and his performance, or lack thereof, is no different here. Every time he's on the screen, let alone when he speaks, I cringe. Even when his mask is on, the annoyance still shines through! Most of the acting from the rest of the cast suffers because of him. The only ones who appear to be trying, are: Emma Stone, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Everyone else does horribly with their acting! One thing I need to point out, is the casting of Sally Field as May Parker. Just hear me out, she did a decent job with her performance here. The only problem, is that she looks way too young to play that character! May Parker in the comic books is supposed to be older woman with gray hair. Did no one in the casting session pick up on that? Or, just look for a picture from the comics? Talk about lazy casting, what an embarrassment! As far as the soundtrack by James Horner goes, it's about as generic as you can get. Granted, it does have it's moments here and there. But overall, his film score adds nothing to this ""movie""! That's a shock, because James Horner has written many great film scores. What happened to him here? Any way, let's get to the only two good elements in this piece of garbage. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in New York City! As far as the special effects go, they are well-done and still hold up today. They do get a bit cheesy at times, but I still give them a pass. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is one of the most pointless reboot movies in the history of cinema. Whenever I think about it, I shudder with sheer disgust. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I have to tell you to stay away from this ""movie""? I think that's more than obvious enough. Just stick with the original ""Spider-Man"" trilogy with the one, and only, Tobey Maguire. Not only are those three films the best ""Spider-Man"" movies, it just so happens to be one of my top ten favorite trilogies of all-time. Any way, those are the real ""Spider-Man"" films! All of the other ones suck, big-time. If, for some reason, you feel the need to subject yourself to ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", you won't be cheering: ""go web, go!"" Instead, you'll be shouting: ""go movie, go!"" You'll just be sitting there, waiting for it to end. What a pile of trash it is!","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","veksdave","23 November 2021","I rewatched this movie and now it¬¥s my favorite spiderman movie, is basically a remake of spiderman1 but maguire¬¥s trilogy aged bad honestly, this one has better pacing and amazing visuals, the Lizard is not as iconic as Dafoe¬¥s Green goblin but has a good story and fight scenes and the dark tone of the movie is interesting tough i like Jon Watts comedy too, extra points for Gwen Stacy and Stan Lee cameo.","1/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Thekeybaldemasterrises","3 July 2012","OK, let me start off with the other people, they clearly are not comic book fans, and don't pay attention to the news, what people are not realizing is not everything we expected to see is revealed in this movie, it's gonna play out later in the series. Alright on to the movie, now I myself was concerned that this movie wasn't going to live up to my expectations, I was wrong. Marc Webb and his crew did an amazing job making a great story told again in a way that actually works, Not to mention they hired a great and talented cast for the movie, Andrew Garfield mostly. He really pulls off that nerdy look of Peter Parker that just didn't look that great on Tobey Maguire. Now I wasn't a big fan of Kirsten Dunst, I never was. Emma stone was a lovable character, and I can really see the chemistry between her and Garfield that looks realistic. Now Rhys Ifans was an interesting character, and his acting was very well done for the lizard. Now this was my only issue for the movie, the lizard was entertaining, but he wasn't as enjoyable as the green goblin William Defoe played in Sam Rami's series. And in shorter words everyone did great being their characters. Now as far as the FX go, they were spectacular, the CG used for the Lizard was impressive too, they are only a few action sequences in the movie, but I didn't care! Peter's character was entertaining all the way through, what some people don't realize about Spidey is he's just a kid, and that life wasn't all Pilates from the city when he began his job as the web slinger; what I see in great comic book movies like this and batman Begins is the realism, cops just don't trust masked vigilantes immediately that's all part of the realism, that's why they prove themselves heroes later in their stories. So above all 10/10, the movie is great, ignore these crazy IMDb reviews and just enjoy the ride!","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","jace_the_film_guy","29 July 2021","With three different live-action interpretations in a 15-year span, Spider-Man's cinematic history is deeply complicated. Unlike other franchises which produce reboots to correct past mistakes, Spider-Man has been able to build upon and find depth with each new iteration the web-slinger. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy helped spark the superhero renaissance, Jon Watts' MCU films brought a levity to the character, and Marc Webb's variations brought darkness and grit to the character previously unseen.I absolutely love this film and that is largely due to the cinematography and direction. The POV shots are breathtaking, the bridge scene is mesmerizing and everything involving Uncle Ben and Aunt May is beautifully well-crafted. On multiple occasions, I was either brought to tears or covered in goosebumps due to the captivating performances and emotionally driven storylines. While there is brilliance in every Spider-Man film so far, this one might just be at the top.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","sbweightman","13 October 2018","Not really amazing, but a good alternative interpretation of the Spider-Man story which is different enough to remain interesting.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","Animany94","3 April 2020","I grew up with Tobey Maguire playing the masked web-slinger, but re-watching it made me reconsider its greatness, because the acting was only sercivable and the romance lacking. But still Spider-Man 2 is a winner!But that brings me to The Amazing Spider-Man in which I actually was way more into Andrew Garfield's acting as Peter Parker, even if his take on the web-slinger was a tad overacted.And the romance with Gwen Stacey was actually really cute. So, the problems are minimal and I enjoyed the movie with the Lizard being an awesome villain and the action scenes with their intensity.","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","akashtaker001","23 June 2012","Saw an early preview. After watching this I think even 3rd one was way better then this. Actually is a Twilight like romance film about Peter Parker. Spider-Man is just there for a little time to attract more viewers. I went for a action adventure film instead I got a love story. Previously I thought Ghost Rider 2 was worst film this year now its Amazing Lame Spider Man. This really happens when you hire a director whose only film is a low budget Romance film. This movie just made me sick, how can you even fool audience by giving a Romance film packaged as an action film. Whatever 3D was used was decent but, climax with Lizard was not anything special. CGI looks very fake and cheesy. The effects in this film are only comparable to first Spider-Man, second and third was way beyond this league. I don't know who was the master mind to green light this script. Because this will not attract the core Spidey fans, but if the studio wanted to attract the Twilight audience they might be successful. To conclude I hope this is the end of Spider-Man and its rights go back to Marvel and Disney so we can see Real Spider Man in near future.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","me-961-82779","4 July 2012","Yet another disappointing superhero ""blockbuster"". I don't think this film can quite work out what it wanted to be. At times there were elements of a darker more serious tone which worked well. But then these moments were spoiled with the usual fast camera editing style of the action scenes which at some points you could not work out what was going on (though I suppose if your of the Call of Duty & Transformers generation this will be appealing to you). Absolutely nothing new or interesting in the terms of plot , the same old good guy who accidentally turns himself bad and ends in a CGI city fight like almost all these Superhero action films endings. Convenient and predictable scenes (the crane scene at the end is just laughable). Good points - I like the new Spiderman, he really captures the ""Smart Ass"" style Spiderman well and is a lot better than the Emo-Spiderman the other one was.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","ars89","29 June 2012","Marc webb is definitely the worst director of this summer.The movie is seriously lacks in every thing, Direction, story, Action, screenplay.First of all why didn't they focus more on Peter's dad history, what's the reason that his story was left alone on the first place. They movies lacks in holding down audience attention, during the mid-way of the movie, I almost got fed up, that i wanted to leave the movie in between.The ending is the worst, there is no big action sequence like the previous movies. Ending is definitely the weakest point of this movie. The charters have no mutual connection, they characters are soulless and andrew(peter) doesn't look in any shape to be a science geek.SFX were good.The movie also leaves behind the Peter's private and professional side, such as his photography and his arrogant editor.What happened to irfan khan character. This movie is filled with flaws.Final verdict Don't see this movie It is a waste of your money, better wait for the avengers DVD 2/10","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","SkullScreamerReturns","27 September 2021","When this movie came out I was ready to call it unnecessary because why would you need a reboot right after Sam Raimi's very good trilogy? How can there be any new ideas left?But it's surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the 2002 movie but still better than average superhero flicks. The tone is this time a bit darker and more serious, but there is some comedy too. Many new fresh ideas are found. There is more emphasis on Peter Parker being a high school student, and also more sci-fi in the story. Mary Jane is not missed long because another iconic love interest is introduced - Gwen Stacy. Even though MJ is my favorite, Emma Stone is great as Gwen.I think it's a good comic book movie that can be recommended to Spider-Man fans.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","sufyaanrashid95","13 June 2023","The Amazing Spider-Man is a reboot of the beloved superhero franchise, and it breathes fresh life into the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield shines in the lead role, bringing a new energy and depth to the character that is both refreshing and compelling.The movie follows Peter's journey as he discovers his powers and learns to navigate the complexities of being a superhero. The story is engaging and well-paced, with plenty of action and humor to keep audiences entertained.Director Marc Webb has done an excellent job of creating a visually stunning movie, with action scenes that are both thrilling and inventive. The special effects are top-notch, and the 3D version of the movie is particularly impressive.But what really sets The Amazing Spider-Man apart is its focus on character development. The movie takes the time to explore Peter's relationships with the people around him, including his love interest Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone) and his surrogate father figure, Uncle Ben (played by Martin Sheen). These relationships are complex and nuanced, and they add an emotional depth to the movie that is often missing from superhero films.Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man is a must-see for fans of the superhero genre. It is a fresh and exciting take on a classic hero, with a strong cast, engaging story, and impressive visuals. Whether you're a longtime fan of Spider-Man or a newcomer to the franchise, this movie is sure to entertain and delight you.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Gerhard-60-351513","30 June 2012","I cant really say it was a bad movie, but after the other Spiderman movies I was really disappointed with this one.The 3D scenes are pretty poor, I would rather see them normally then how they filmed it in 3D. Also the action scenes are short and not that exciting. The movie is also missing some real drama and emotion, the dramatic scenes (like where is uncle dies) are just very fast and basically skipped.I also think that Spiderman is really weak here, he doesn't really feel like a superhero. He's running away from some gangster and gets shot by policeman. If I knew the movie was like this I wouldn't have watch it in the cinema, its just not worth the money.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","PeteRoy","7 July 2012","I watched this movie when it premiered and here is what I think of it: Pointless It has story lines which that don't go anywhere which leaves you with a feeling of why I bothered to see this movie.The Gwen Stacey storyline is progressing to something serious but then nothing happens.The Peter Parker parents mystery is progressing to get the truth but then nothing happens.Only other smaller less meaningful stories get completion but they were boring and not important.This movie is a disappointment and weak.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","estebangonzalez10","8 July 2012","¬®We all have secrets: the ones we keep... and the ones that are kept from us.¬®Spider-Man is back with a reboot and although it seemed sort of early for it, Marc Webb did a great job with this film by refreshing the story and the characters. I enjoyed the first three Spider-Man films, although I wasn't a huge fan of them. Webb not only refreshed the series, but he also improved it in my opinion by doing one thing: getting Andrew Garfield to play Peter Parker. Garfield, who I really appreciated in The Social Network despite having flown under the radar in that movie, is excellent as Peter Parker. He has the right amount of charisma and wit that his character needs. I loved his performance much more than Tobey Maguire's. The other great addition to this reboot was the inclusion of Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Peter's original love interest in the comics and who was played by Bryce Dallas Howard in the third film. Emma Stone is one of the greatest young talents on the screen and she is just lovely in this film and had great chemistry with Garfield. Webb had proved in the past that he could make a strong romantic film with his feature film debut, 500 Days of Summer, but I wasn't sure how the action was going to work out in The Amazing Spider-Man. The truth of the matter is that the action scenes were excellently choreographed and the film was visually stunning; I had a great time at the theater. I don't know if a reboot was absolutely necessary at this stage, but I had a fun time nonetheless. There are a few similarities between the original Spider-Man and this film, but for the most part screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves chose a different approach in this version of the superhero story. They focused more on Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) troubles in school as a teenager and how he dealt with his parents death. After leaving him with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), his parents never returned so Peter was raised by them with strong moral values. Despite having a great relationship with them, Peter is still hurt about the loss of his biological parents and is trying to deal with it as well as his growing feelings for his classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). While trying to deal with all these normal teenage feelings, Peter discovers a forgotten briefcase of his father which contains some secrets about his past. Peter finds a picture of his father with Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who used to be his good friend and science partner in Oscorp. That is when Peter decides to visit Oscorp and is bitten by a genetic spider. We all know the result of that spider bite: Peter becomes Spider-Man. As he tries to manage these new special abilities, Peter also befriends Dr. Connors in search for answers about his parents past. Peter deciphers an equation he found from his father's briefcase which allows Dr. Connors to make a huge advance in his genetic experiments, which ultimately leads to him becoming the Lizard, Spider-Man's nemesis.If you would've told me that the silly guy from Notting Hill would be playing The Lizard I would've thought it was a joke. Rhys Ifans is great in comedies, but I never imagined he could play an important villain with such success. The people behind the casting of this film did a tremendous job because every character seemed to be played by the perfect actor. I mean who better to play Captain Stacy than Denis Leary? Every role just fit perfectly and that was what ultimately made The Amazing Spider-Man such a fun film. Andrew Garfield with his unique wit and charm works almost in the same way that Robert Downey Jr. did as Tony Stark. It was as if these actors were born to play these roles. The entire cast was great in this film, so was the crew behind the special effects department. The film looks really good and is exactly what a summer blockbuster movie is supposed to be. The Amazing Spider-Man might not be as great as The Avengers, but it still was a really entertaining film worth the ticket price. Spider-Man fans will be pleased and I doubt anyone will be missing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker after this performance, although I still have my reservations over whether or not a reboot of the series was necessary at this early stage.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Smells_Like_Cheese","8 July 2012","10 years ago, I remember seeing the opening of the biggest film that year, Spider-Man. I'm not kidding, I remember everything about that opening. It was the first time I ever saw teenagers bring comic books to the movie doing comparison notes. I remember it being so crowded and crazy. But I also remember loving the movie and I still watch it today. So when I heard that they were rebooting the franchise, I was kind of curious why they were rebooting so soon. But after seeing the trailers, I still wanted to see the movie. I'm not a crazy comic book fan or anything, I just like super-hero movies. So this review is from the movie-goer, not the comic book advocate. I really did like The Amazing Spider-Man, this was a great pick up from Spider-Man 3. It was trying to touch the territory of being like Batman Begins, taking the character and story a little more seriously without the overage of cheesy one-liners and costumes. What worked well for this movie was the cast and story.Young Peter Parker's dad, Richard, gathers up hidden documents, and Peter's parents take him to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, then mysteriously disappear. Years later, a teenage Peter attends high school, where he has caught the eye of Gwen Stacy. At home, Peter finds Richard's papers, and learns his father worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curt Connors at Oscorp. Faking his way into Oscorp as one of a group of high-school interns, Peter sneaks into a lab where a ""biocable"" is being created from genetically modified spiders, one of which bites him. On the subway ride home, he is shocked to find strange spider-like abilities manifesting. After studying Richard's papers, he visits the one-armed Connors at home, reveals he is Richard Parker's son, and gives Connors his father's ""decay rate algorithm"", the missing piece in Connors' experiments on regenerating limbs based on lizard DNA. Connors is being pressured by his superior, Dr. Ratha, to devise a cure for the dying, unseen head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn. He one night does the experiment forcing to him to become a giant lizard and wants to seek revenge on those who wronged him, but Peter with his new powers will try to stop him and save the city.Did I need to see why Peter becomes Spider-Man again? Not really. Also for ""nerds"", our two leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are extremely good looking people. But I'll buy into it and just have fun. I liked the explanation given a little better than the first on why Peter feels the need to be Spider-Man. Also, does Dennis Leary always have to be the downer in almost all his movies? I mean his last lines in the film*Spoiler Alert!!*, he's dying in Peter's arms and tells Peter to leave Gwen alone, that's the finest girl he's ever going to get and he's going to listen to that?! I was telling my fianc√©, if I were Peter, I would've hit Dennis before he died and said ""oh, how sad you're dying, just go in peace"" and play it off like it's sad or just screamed after he tells Peter not to see Gwen any more ""Why won't you die?!"". Poor Peter, go get yourself a hottie, Dennis's character was a jerk anyways. I digress; the only thing I have to say that was missing from this one compared to the first Spider-Man, it doesn't quite have Raimi's heart. There are a few flaws with the movie, but all the movies are flawed in one way or another. I think this was a fine addition to the franchise and highly recommend The Amazing Spider-Man, it was a lot of fun.8/10","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","megatronskywalker","20 September 2021","Andrew Garfield is likable as Peter Parker. He has a great performance and his chemistry with Emma Stone is undeniable. Is he a comic accurate Peter Parker? In some aspects yes, in others no. He is still a science whiz and is more or less your ""everyman"" archetype, but gone is the geeky nerd seen in the early comics. This Peter Parker is cool, but still gives off the loner attitude that character needs. I think it works really well, but I understand why some people wouldn't be entirely on board with it.The Lizard plot in this movie was very obviously cut down, and is pretty lacking in general character development. There are a few key scenes that were cut from the movie which make for really compelling character moments, and I have to say the movie is a lot worse off without them. Overall I thought the main story was pretty solid, though.I wouldn't recommend this as an introduction to Spider-Man, but as a fun superhero action movie it's more than solid and is a lot of fun.","6/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","starsteamer","29 March 2013","The other movies are OK. They stick to the original storyline and the acting was fine - it involved quite a few of my favourite actors. But for me, the movies lacked the engagement I had with the comics as a kid when Spiderman was my favourite superhero. Therefore I got bored to the point that I didn't even bother watching the third film. I am pleased to report that for me this is the Spiderman from the comics come to life on the big screen. Andrew Garfield plays the geeky, hopeless, clumsy hero who even though he has amazing powers, is still a nerd at heart. I did prefer Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin but I do love Rhys Ifans who does a great job. The storyline he is attached to is modern and relevant. Martin Sheen is always a pleasure to watch and I shed real tears when he inevitably dies. I had been put off by the last movies but this was much better than I expected. The only thing that puts me off is that Garfield looks so much like tennis player Andy Murray it's weird to see him smile...","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","Meven_Stoffat","28 June 2012","I'll admit I was a tad skeptical about the movie. Not in a bad way, but I was unsure if the series really needed a reboot. Sure the third movie sucked, but to have seen a follow-up to it would have been a good idea. However, after seeing an advance screening of this movie in IMAX 3D tonight, I Rescind all my doubts.No, really. This movie is spectacular. Everything about it was just... Awesome. In fact, if anything, the Raimi movies don't really interest me anymore, no matter how much I loved SM2. I know that's a bold statement to make, but seriously, this film fixes everything wrong with the Raimi movies, and is definitely more than just an apology for Spider Man 3.For one, it all starts with the tone. From the opening scene where Peter gets ready for a game of Hide and Seek, there's shades of Nolan's Batman movies in it. Throughout the movie there is an air of neo-noir, in a similar fashion to ""Drive""- even the score hints to a bit of a film noir feel. It suits the film because if anything this is an origin story before a superhero movie. The dark and gritty tone still stays consistent throughout, even in the action scenes.The story might not be totally original but it all comes down to how they handle it, and they sure handle it well. How Peter finds the clues to an unfinished experiment in Uncle Ben's flooded basement, and how he manages to piece the algorithm together with Curtis Connors. They do a good job of balancing out the origin story and the action, I dare say! And the chemistry between Gwen and Peter was very believable too. They didn't devote too much time to the love story, which is always a good thing. The contrast between Peter and Curtis is fantastic as well, and if anything is one of the better hero/villain chemistry works in recent years.As for the action scenes? INCREDIBLE. I must say, I love how they kept them grounded and realistic,saving the epic sweep until the big finale. They scrapped the campy and over the top feel of the original movies and give us rough and brutal fights, just how we want it. Garfield handles the action well and you can tell he did a lot of his own stunts too. The fight scenes between Spider Man and Lizard were fantastic, especially the grand finale in the Oscorp tower at the end!And the acting. I must say the acting was fantastic. Garfield KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK, here. MacGuire was too much of a metrosexual pansy for me to take him seriously. Garfield is a total nerd, and as a result, he gets the role right. He even looks nerdy, and it helps as well. The way he manages to hold back his British accent is extraordinary as well, and his humorous kick he adds to the character works too. Emma Stone is fantastic as Gwen Stacy and adds real depth to the character, in an almost unexpected way. Her and Peter Parker's chemistry works on every level. Ifans is a great villain, and he manages to add an air of sympathy to the villain, making his transformation into the Lizard very tragic and poignant. And Leary... Well, what can we say? Brilliant and funny as usual, he even ad libs a few lines, and you'll know which lines those are (""do I look like the mayor of Tokyo?!"").In short, Webb, Stone, Garfield and Ifans have knocked one out of the park. An absolutely stellar effort thanks to great talent and I can assure you that I ¬†will be seeing the movie again. And I can also assure you that this is a must see, with tons of action, intrigue, humour and dark tone as well. Do not miss it!","8/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","KFstudios2009","21 October 2023","The Amazing Spider-Man was a simple spider-man movie, this time in the main role as Spider-man they introduce Andrew Garfield, that played him just ok, he played like a Spider-man should be played, but he wasn't outstanding and not so funny as the Tom Holland Spider-man, that I like much better. About the movie, I think it was very dark, made in a very retro-noir style, the dark city of Manhattan and the underground lab scenes, introducing the new villain, a scientist that mutates to a green, slimy Lizard that want to kill Spider-man, the plot drived me on, but I can't say it was so entertaining as it could have been. The movie did have some very clear Spider-man elements, they showed us the story of how he become how he is, but no, it wasn't just what I was expecting to happen. The problem was that the plot wasn't much of it. When everything happen, they just added some action sequences to make it entertaining, but it wasn't much of it. The dark-noir style was interesting at first but later it wasn't so much impressive. The school scenes were Spider-man was just Peter Parker was cool, but it lost that element of teenage genre and his romance between him and his girl, Gwen Stacy, wasn't much convincing. His transformation and his rise of powers did happen to slow and random, he acted like it was a normal thing that happen with everyone. I don't know, I watched this once, and I don't want to watch it again. Random is the right word of describing this movie. Fun at times but was mostly a random superhero flick.","6/10"

"The Amazing Spider-Man","flicklover","15 June 2021","I have only seen The Amazing Spider-Man a couple of times. I remember seeing it the first time and being kind of ambivalent on whether I liked it or not. But as a guy who watches films I like many times I just rarely revisit this one. I have to admit I love the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films and had a sort of disinterest in this one from the start so it did have a strike against it. It had been 5 years since Raimi's Spider-Man 3 and even though it was a mess and many were disappointed by it I have always felt that it was unfairly panned. It was not nearly as bad a some have said. So only 5 years later come this complete reboot. Complete with another origin story explaining how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man.This is not a shot for shot remake of the earlier Raimi films. Peter Parker is played by Andrew Garfield this time and his take on Peter Parker/Spider-Man is different from Tobey Maguire. Garfield plays Peter as more of a slacker with sort of an attitude as opposed to MacGuire's take which was Peter as a put upon geek. Garfield is fine but I just like Maguire's take better.The film deals in more detail with Peter's parents and their disappearance. His relationship with his Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae played by Martin Sheen and Salley Field. The film puts more emphasis on their relationship and the performances are fine but it gets tedious and drags the film down. The villain is Dr. Curt Connors played by Rhys Ifans. He eventually becomes The Lizard. He is the antagonist to Spider-Man. Connors is trying to find a way to regenerate human limbs with lizard DNA. Eventually he becomes The Lizard and of course he and Spider-Man duke it out. There isn't much more than that. The performances are good but the story is just a slightly different version of the Raimi origin story that is just too familiar and not as compelling. This film is competently made but it offers nothing new or memorable. The action scenes are ok but there is nothing distinctive about them. Competent but forgettable action. That is the biggest issue with this film. There is nothing about it that sets it apart or tops the Raimi films. The shadow of the Raimi films looms large here. It's not bad in any way, but it's just average. Nothing sets it apart.Grade: C.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","CriticalOfEverything","6 May 2018","I'm not a Sam Raimi fanboy or elitist. I liked Raimi's original trilogy but it's not perfect. And Spider-Man 3 was OK. But I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't. I have my limits when it comes to dark versions of classic characters and this movie just passes through them. For Spider-Man, this is way too dark. There is some light-hearted stuff here, but I just can't enjoy this movie with how dark it gets. If it was like Spider-Man 2 then maybe I could enjoy it a lot more because Spider-Man 2 along with Avengers: Infinity War manage to put Spider-Man in a dark setting whilst still making it enjoyable and fun to watch with some great drama. This movie just tries too hard with blood, a grim and dark setting, hell, the POSTER for this movie pretty much summarises why I dislike it so much. Other than the unneeded edgyness, the soundtrack was fine, the cast is OK (but Andrew Garfield does not fit Peter Parker at all), and the action is decent enough. But this movie just gives off such a weird and depressing vibe when it's a movie about one of the most light-hearted, fun and cheesy comic book characters of all time. It may be a technically fine movie, but I just can't enjoy it with how much they try and make Spider-Man edgy and dark.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","saadgkhan","3 December 2012","The Amazing Spiderman ‚Äì CATCH IT (A-) The anticipation for Spiderman movie was building from the time when Sam Raimi and Tobey MaGuire walked out of the franchise because of their creative differences with Sony. After that Sony decide to make a more Gothic and true to its origin Spiderman after huge critical and box office success of The Dark Night rises. Eventually Marc Jacobs, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone joint the reboot. The comparison between the original and reboot Spiderman movies is obvious. Marc Webb did try to make Spiderman as dark as he could have done and Andrew Garfield is defiantly is very talented. He did an impressive job as Peter Parker bringing the emotions which we rarely seen in comic book movie heroes even though he lacked the innocence of Tobey MaGuire's Peter Parker. Emma Stone is nice as always even with her blonde locks. Sally Fields, Martin Sheen, Rhys Ifans and Chris Zylka did a fine job. Though I have to say that Indian actor Irfan Khan was completely wasted and we never get to see for whom he was working and even though in deleted DVD scenes we see Lizard killing him in the tunnels but still no answer for the person he was working for. Finally, after watching the Amazing-Spiderman , I think the first Spider-Man movie was better as it had naive peter, cool organic webbing (even-though I understand the logic behind mechanical webbing) it was natural and animalistic or should d I say Insect-listic of him. The Amazing-Spider man was smart, witty and mouthy from start so when he got powers it was like Cherry on the Cake. The first one has better Villain the Green Goblin as it was rooted within the friendship of young Harry none-the-less Lizard was very real and graphics were spot-on but his logic to destroy and make everyone a Lizard was weird. Kirsten Dunst and Emma Stone both played different comic-book characters so comparison is not fair and since both Peter's had good chemistry with their girls. And now let's talk about ending there is no doubt Spider-Man's ending was Great from accidentally Green Goblin and leaving him his home and Harry walking in on him to saving Mary Jane and Kids at the same time to leaving Mary Jane for ever at funeral and from Mary Jane finding out he is spider-man with the Kiss. Everything was in big Spectacular way. So I did love The Amazing Spider-Man but the winner is Spider-Man Indeed!","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","ross_kewl","7 July 2012","So here it is again folks, but this time, its not just Spiderman, its an AMAZING Spiderman. For someone who thought the original Spiderman was amazing, this movie surely would leave a lasting imprint in my mind that would deem this movie truly the most amazing Spiderman film yet. Wrong. Although this movie wasn't terrible, it wasn't astounding either.The movie starts off with your typical nerd who gets picked on by the school bully. Sounds similar nay? Through one way or another Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) finds himself infiltrating a million-dollar bio medical research facility and gets bitten by a spider and starts to exhibit spider-like qualities. To the positives, Andrew Garfield did a tremendous job and I think it would a close contest between him and Tobey Maguire. His smart-ass appeal was entertaining without being too silly. I preferred Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) to Mary-Jane basically because she actually helped save the world instead of being the Damsel in distress. Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) also deserves a mention as the characters death really had a profound effect on Spidey so the acting in this movie is top-notch.The area in which this movie could have been improved was the plot, and I find with a lot of movies lately, that the writing for the plot has let down some great acting. Prometheus (2012) is a perfect example. ""Peter Parker finds a clue that might help him understand why his parents disappeared when he was young. His path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner."" Summary from the IMDb, Spiderman page. The mystery that was presented at the beginning of the movie is never even solved. Why did his parents abandon their only son? It never occurred to me that Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) was trying to hunt down Peter Parker's elusive parents. I never really understood the Connors' motivations. At first he was researching cross-species mutation is a bid to repair his amputated forearm. Then it changes because he thinks human kinds is weak and we should all be turned into monstrous lizards. The fight scenes were a bit unbelievable and silly. I was watching this with my friend and we both take chemistry and we laughed when dinosaur Connors grabbed two coloured solutions, mixed them together to create a HE grenade. Liquid Nitrogen on the top of a skyscraper? Really? I concede that Lizards are able to grow back their tails, BUT NOT ENTIRE F***ING LIMBS!!! Salamanders, which are amphibians can regrow limbs but no reptile that has been identified possesses the ability to regrow limbs. I guess also Peter got bored of pursuing his Uncle's killer and decided to become a superhero instead. The crane guy and his cranes was commendable but cringeful and didn't really have the effect that it intended to have. My final ramble is about Parker defending Spiderman's actions at the awkward girlfriend dinner table scene. The way it appeared to me that Parker was only chasing criminals to find the man who killed his uncle, not a public service. And when he did find criminals he wasn't exactly dropping them off in front of the police station, he was having a great time shooting webs into their crotches.Overall, I think the movie attempted to fit too much in the time frame. There were many ideas that were forgotten during the movie and at points got a bit silly for me to tolerate. This movie isn't terrible and is definitely above 6 stars but doesn't deserve as 8 or higher.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","projectsgamer","22 March 2021","The Amazing Spiderman is my third fav Spiderman movie in the entire series here we have Andrew Garfield playing Peter Park and Spiderman because of the problem they had with Spider-Man 3 of course Sony was the problem what is so messed up they did twice with the amazing Spiderman 2 but anyway let's talk about this film one of my fav superhero movies also I think peter in this is good but not enough tho it's still good of course he does not look nerdy which people don't like again Andrew Garfield is a great movie to me he is my second fav Spiderman out of the whole series by far ok Gwen she is by far my fav love interest for peter in the entire series the chemistry is amazing with them too Marc Webb knows how to make the characters feel natural like real people, not people just being on set The Lizard in this movie I do like but here is my one problem not a clear motive for the Lizard is the arm but then his boss said no and he started ejecting him self with the serum to make him transform into the Lizzard Mom and Dad story was way to short what I don't like Sony marked this movie as a dark story for peter well guess what once again that did not happen but it was fine nothing crazy also this Capt.

"The Amazing Spider-Man","jayjaycee","14 February 2020","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a 2012 comic book adaptation directed by Marc Webb starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. As many of my longtime followers may know, the annual rewatch of this flick is part of my Valentine's Day tradition. ""Why exactly this one?"" some of you may ask legitimately. I'll tell you. I started this ritual when I was around thirteen years old and this film was one of my all time favourites. So, I said to myself, you either gonna have a date on the day of love or watch Spider-Man instead. What am I to say? For the past several years it has always been the adventure of the arachnid avenger and I gave this old DVD more spins than any spintop I have ever owned. Cupid hasn't been the best shooter in my case, so that's the way it is. First of all, I wanna make it clear that my personal taste in cinema has absolutely changed since then and that this film definitely isn't one of the greatest ever. You know, it's still not bad though. As someone born around the new millennium, I happen to have grown up with every single interpretation of the most famous web slinger. Maguire was the man during my childhood years, Garfield was there when I was in my early teen years and Holland is there now that I have reached maturity (at least, by law). So, I can actually enjoy every adaptation of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. I gotta admit though that I now realize some definite flaws. The most indisputable problem of this flick is that it's obviously spinning it's web around the foundation of the Raimi trilogy instead of building something original in the first place. There are countless stories in the comic books it could have adapted in a way never seen before, but it rather insisted on following the same pattern and sometimes using the same scenes with only mildly changed dialogue. This is where it really shows that it's a reboot rather than an all new adaptation. Aside from these decisions that were probably mostly made by Avi Arad, the director Marc Webb who was literally born for this job (at least, by name) did decent work. He managed well to direct a magnificent cast that consists of academy award winners and nominees. Even though Garfield and Stone are slightly too old to portray high school teenagers (this has always been a problem for the casting directors when it comes to casting them) they still looked wonderful in their respective roles and, in the case of the first, acted superbly in the context of the format. Also, I'd like to point out the atmospheric score of James Horner that is hands down the best aspect of this flick. The screenplay shows both greatness and debacles. First, it's cool that they finally brought The Lizard to the big screen with actually impressive CGI. I've never seen a Lizard speaking with such a prominent English accent before, so that's an achievement. Second, the chemistry between the protagonists is so lovely and some scenes had surprisingly well written dialogue (the dinner discussion!) and the new style of the suit is amazing (pun intended) too. So is the action in the fight sequences that finally contain new camera angles and shots that use the power of swinging for the first time. This innovation is apparently ignored by the most and definitely needs to be appreciated more! Well, but let's get to the negative aspects as well: The film is basically too long with a runtime of more than two hours while one third consists of the origin story that we've all been knowing about and that was at times recreated scene by scene from Raimi's features. Also, the whole ""responsibility"" aspect was altered into something less inspiring and only used as a side theme that never fully reached its whole potential in the story. Additionally, what's the point of building up this whole ""obligation over choice"" symbolism only to destroy and negate it with the last lines? It's undeniably a dumb decision, even if it means that Gwen and Peter can become a couple in the obviously set up sequel. Oh, the immense disrespect to Captain Stacy whose last wish was that his daughter would be left out of it ... Well, we all know how that ends eventually. All in all, this extended Sony advertisment in a Marvel adaptation is a decent fun nevertheless. I'm probably a bit biased, but not that much. It's nice mindless fun for in between and although it's not remembered or appreciated in the pop culture, definitely played a significant role in the history of the hero's films. It's highly influenced by Sam Raimi and suffers from the lack of originality, but remains a childhood pleasure. I'm not sure if I'm gonna revisit it ever again. Let's hope I have a date on Valentine's Day next year. Otherwise, you all know where I'm gonna swing by.","7/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","donutpizza","7 July 2012","While this Spider-Man reboot is certainly more enjoyable than most movies, the previous version was better. The writers went out of their way to change all the little details from the previous version, but kept much of the same major plot points the same.This version's morality points, catch phrases, romance and emotional moments just weren't as well done. And there was almost no comedy. There were no major plot holes, but there were multiple small ones that bugged me. On the other hand, the acting was excellent, by all the actors, and the awkward teenager aspect was well done.But on the whole I prefer the previous version.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","abhinanddevadass","6 January 2022","Honestly I loved it when it first came out Andrew Garfield is like the best man in the spider man suit.It's like he was born for it. The movie was like a rebirth of Tobey's version but much better. He developing his own web shooters are my favourite part. I am not saying Tobey's spider man was good enough, Andrew was astonishing in the movie from top to bottom.....","3/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","gispi-50787","30 December 2021","Although we've seen the origin story before, it is a fresh reset with Gwen instead of MJ. I will never get tired of seeing Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield together. Emma is so fun to watch, and the banter between Peter and Gwen is fun.I definitely laughed more at the real teen angst, that is also very relatable to my teen years. It would've been nice to see more ""nerd"" from this portrayal of Peter.I feel like the CGI for Lizard just feels off. That's my major take away.","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","pedrovelazquez","12 July 2012","After 500 days of summer I had a very high opinion of Marc Webb. Now I don't know what to think about him. I was tempted to leave the theater, but I wanted to wait to the end. I felt sorry for Emma Stone, who actually did a good job. Sally Field looked like a beggar, and her character was very close to non existent.I simply can't understand why anybody would like this movie. I don't even know where to start... The poor dialogs, and the even poorer story. This movie really makes the first Spiderman a favor. I'm certainly not a fan of Tobey McGuire, but Andrew Garfield is a far worse choice for even Peter Parker, not to say for Spiderman in costume.Please avoid this film. It is such a waste of time, and money. I can't wait for the sequel, to avoid it.","1/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","eberkerbatur","16 January 2020","Much different from the first 3 film series it is again about how Peter is a spiderman but with a different concept.Firstly the effects have been much better, player choices I can say right but I still think that Tobey Maguire is a better Peter Parker maybe not a better spiderman, but peter parker reflected his life wellIn the first 3 films Peter Parker saw more of his life was further processed In this film, the action scenes are more and the adventures of the spiderman more processed.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","teixcal-imdb","11 July 2012","Fans of Spider-man comics will still be waiting for an adaptation that truly reflects the mood of the comic-book after leaving the theatre from watching ""The Amazing Spider-man"". As an adaptation the film makes a very good composition of Peter Parker as an high-school student but fails completely in the Peter Parker as an ""adoptive son"" of his uncles. The relationship between Peter Parker and May Parker is incredibly misrepresented. As an adaptation, too much liberties are taken with other traits of the Spider-man character.But, and as a film on its own, leaving aside the supposed adaptation status, The Amazing Spider-man is very unbalanced movie. Peter Parker is never a character one can really relate to. It is too schematic and lacks profundity. Also we never quite understand how other characters like Gwen Stacy and his own aunt May can be so sympathetic towards Peter Parker because his behaviour to keep is secret identity a secret come off as a real jerk. So all the sympathy towards Peter Parker is never believable. Is like people just decided that Parker is OK and nothing he does can change that. C'mon people, get real. The ""origins"" scene, when Parker acquires its spider-powers is also a very unbelievable one. It misses one thing to make it believable: the uniqueness. The way it was enacted, it sounds like anybody can acquire does powers if they found themselves in the position Peter is in, there is no circumstance that let it be a once-in-lifetime occasion and no repeatable to anyone once it happens to Peter Parker. And that kind of finishes everything for a super-hero film. It just doesn't work to think that any time tomorrow or the next day some other guy walks into a room and comes out another spider-man. The film is also very lengthy without any particular reason. It seems that scenes where just included to play with special effects and 3D. Since the special effects are really not particularly awesome it works against the film. The attempt to introduce a larger plot to be continued in sequels revolving around Peter Parker's parents also does not work because frankly the viewer never has anything in the plot that makes one care for Parker's parents. Overall the Amazing Spider-man is a disappointing film. It is not terrible. It is not good. Is ""watchable"" but leaves no impression whatsoever.","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","DameFlux","10 July 2012","Andrew Garfield is a terrific actor. Martin Sheen is a superb actor. Sally Field is a mind shatteringly brilliant actor. Marc Webb, well he sure does an OK remake of what was a brilliant film. I cant knock him doing a remake 10 years after , or can I . Feel like you have been here before but someone is tweaking details to avoid looking exactly like the original. This is in no way close to what the original film in originality though and if you went back in time and stopped them making the original this would de-evolve into a boneless mess because of what Sony did . Sony wanted to reboot ala Batman for the profit and nothing else. There are no great lines for Andrew, Martin or Sally. They seem lost in this hopeless reboot! Yes , yes I know it didn't ""suck"" but it not ""sucking "" doesn't excuse that it was pointless and derivative. With all the places they could have gone in maturing Parker and family , the characters that developed and challenged the world. What about Spider Man vs the republican party, anything but to waste all of our time with another reboot . Marc is not Christopher Nolan here, he could be but Sony cheated him! Thats right they took a good director and stole a perfect opportunity by forcing him to reboot! I look forward to his freedom from the cheap money changers trying to cash in.","4/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","artrouble21","27 October 2012","some great acting and Garfield nails the Ditko posing of the original comics, don't have a problem with him being too skinny either. Scenes in the sewers nicely echoed the original comic version of this movie, the Lizard is a formidable foe. HOWEVER the back story sucks. Now Flash becomes a misguided good guy, Gwen Stacy is a science nerd, there is no JJ Jameson instead we have the insipid police character. Parker can't wait to show off who he is to all and sundry, and plot rip offs from the Rami movie abound. And for crying out loud Stan Lee can't get enough of himself even now, someone shoot the guy please, with a gun. Most of the Spidey stuff was fine but all other factors in Peter Parkers life were trashed. Surely this rewriting of the characters life/plot is a DC move. There are other reviews of this that I agree with but as to the massive plot holes thru out this film the biggest must be the end where the 'cure' is dispersed over the city and yet has no affect on SPIDERMAN, double duh. The Rami movie is far better and truer to the original comics, Garfield need to step away from this project before it taints his very promising career.","10/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","FrozenOrphan","6 October 2021","So the start of Andrew Garfield's arc in The Amazing Spider Man (1 and 2). Now, this movie was truly amazing, Andrew Garfield makes a great Spider-Man, maybe not the best Peter Parker, but a damn good Spider-Man. Also, The Lizard? A very unique villain choice. It paid off except for the fact Lizard looks like a Ninja Turtle. It's action packed, it's funny, Andrew's Spidey has the best quips out of the 3 Spideys. So that's why it's a 7/10!","8/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","ashishk-89-479883","30 June 2012","Movie was not bad but was expecting something different than the last time. The only thing changed was the story, that would not be appreciated by comic lover round the world. Spider man has somehow become more of a Romeo than a super hero. The super hero movies are now being produced to entertain a wide range of people, which is why I feel they have lost their intensity. The way these movies are coming out day is not far when middle aged mothers would be watching these with their little daughters. The creators these days have somehow become very sensitive and are now coming up with crying heroes. I hope the new batman movie would be better than The Amazing Spider Man.Please someone ask these creators to grow some balls and come up with movies like Predator, Terminator, Rambo, Matrix etc. Rather than remaking the same set of movies again and again ask them to come up with some original ideas, and not such amazing ideas.","5/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","saish746","6 July 2012","The houseful theaters prove that Spiderman's franchise is way bigger than its movies. It does matter who is the new amazing Spiderman, as long as there is more of Spidey than lame Peter Parker. This is fourth sequel which has more of dark Spider-man and his journey finding himself (unknowingly). The first half of movie is a wasted effort to let us know again how Mr Parker was bitten by a spider in a lab and from a timid school boy he turned into a street fighter and designed a costume to finally become a super hero Spider-man. This was so boring journey to re-visit more humanly spidey , even the web shooters were artificial and Webb didn't draw the hero muscular, taking his vice from Ultimate Spider-man. Webb even made the villain little human and comparing Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard with Godzilla will a similar mistake to that of comparing an ant to an elephant.Andrew Garfield was honest as a cute next door school boy however less convincing as a superhero and this time there were no great powers hence no great responsibility. but focused on secrets: the ones we keep... and the ones that are kept from us. A secret formula to grow limbs and mutants. We had so many mutant before and it was also surprising to know that the antidote was made before the poison. The movie lacks charisma of a superhero marvel. Neither the Hero nor the Antagonist was big enough to carry the sequel. We have seen everything before.The promise of turning this one a 3D was another failure. You might see less of graphical heights and more of acting prowess of Garfield. While Sam Raimi was more into super sets and better action, Webb drilled down to emotional aspect of a super-hero. Beware Kids may not like this !!! Mary-Jane Watson was replaced by old timer and more punk smart Gwen Stacy. This too blonde actress was a weak link and Emma Stone had some mixed performance. Rhys Ifans was quite convincing than other casts in the movie. Irrfan had better screen presence than Anil Kapoor in Mission -impossible but he never bragged about it and always confessed it as a smaller role. However he might need to put more expression and eyes while delivering in English. Marc Webb is saved by the franchise'........ 2/5","9/10"
"The Amazing Spider-Man","mel_vishal","30 June 2012","What was wrong with this flick? I'm gonna say 7 out of 10 things, which is prolly why I gave this a 3 rating.Shortcomings - 1. The intro was way too long to get Spidey started with his 'bag of tricks' 2. The action sequences were few and far between3. This reminded me of a typical Bollywood movie with script you'll understand when you watch it (I beg you don't, though) 4. Dr. Lizard... really?? I'm sure this is not what Stan Lee had in mind when he created him 5. Andrew Garfield is better off playing the cat. Toby was far more convincing as Spidey 6. BORINGGGGGGGG 7. The latter part of the movie got me very restless, wanting it to end ASAPThe pluses - 1. The special effects were good, although I don't think I saw all that was shown in the trailers 2. Emma Stone was a pretty as ever 3. Big fan of Spiderman - which is why the 3rd star was a grace","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","planktonrules","26 March 2019","""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a fantastic film but might be a bit overwhelming for some viewers. It's filled with blaring hip-hop music and the animation is beyond splashy...it's competely intense! Now these are NOT criticisms...more a warning if you hate these sorts of things or if you or someone you loves has challenges, such as Autism....as the film might really be overwhelming. Still, I'm nearly 55 and loved the picture...and I think most will if they have an open mind and want something different. That DOES strongly apply to me, as I've gotten sick of superhero movies because there have been so many recently and there's a certain sameness about them...but not this Spider-Man film!The story is told with breathtaking CGI--with a look that is nothing like any other film I've ever seen. In this world is a young man who sees Spider-Man killed and is also bitten by a spider and becomes the next incarnation of Spider-Man. But instead of taking the time to enjoy and learn about his new powers, this young man finds himself in the middle of a weird apocalyptic occurance---and all the various incarnations from the various universes come together to save the day.Overall, amazingly creative...there's nothing else like it. This is more than reason enough to see it. Sadly, however, the film loses a bit on home TVs...even big ones as the scale and size of the film needs the big screen.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Hitchcoc","19 November 2019","So many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, ""This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman."" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation, but this has restored my faith.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","matthewssilverhammer","21 December 2018","The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the ""extended universe"", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes.
Listen, I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have?
Look, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","eaglescout910","17 December 2018","A movie worthy of Stan Lee's approval. Incredible animation, great story, great message. This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations. The only reason I think there are some negative reviews is because you can never please everyone. However, for the vast majority of viewers, I believe you'll find this film to be great. Highly recommend seeing it in theaters just for the amazing animation style.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","cafesmitty","21 December 2018","Have you ever sat through a film and you knew that films would never be the same going forward? For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron ManWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.Plus our the villains are so well done..But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.It's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","BandSAboutMovies","26 December 2018","The thing I hate about superhero movies is the origin story. After a multitude of Spider-Man stories, do we really need another retelling of his origin? That's the first - of many - things that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse does right. Much like how Grant Morrison retold Superman's beginnings in one page in All-Star Superman, this movie tells you everything you need to know within one minute and goes right into the action. It expects you to know the expected, but then once it makes you feel comfortable, it tears the rug out from under you.Here's the low down for those of you that don't read comics: there's more than one reality and more than one version of Spider-Man, who may not always be a man. Written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who left Solo due to creative differences, this movie is pure joy from start to finish. If you know and love the characters, it's so amazing to see them treated properly on the big screen. And if you don't, it's so much fun to meet all new versions of a character you already love.Beyond the Spidey you know and love, there's Miles Morales, a gifted teen who struggles to fit into a new school. He loves Spider-Man, is often at odds with his parents and looks up to his uncle Aaron. While working on graffiti, he's bit by a radioactive spider and suddenly has the same abilities as his hero.After a tragic incident when the real Spidey battles the Kingpin as that baddy tries to uses a particle accelerator to bring back his lost wife and son, Miles must take on the mantle of a hero while working alongside the Spiders of other dimensions: Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham, and Peni Parker and SP//dr.The voice talent in this movie is absolutely amazing: Lily Tomlin is the best Aunt May ever, Nicholas Cage steals the show as Spider-Man Noir, who is from a world where it's always black and white and smells like rain and it was great to hear comedian John Mulaney as Spider-Ham.There's so much of this movie that perfectly translates the language of comics in a way that few films have succeeded in accomplishing. Ang Lee's The Hulk came close, but the animated styles of this film are constantly moving and even more alive than real action.It's also the first time I've seen a teenage world in a superhero movie that feels vibrant and now. Nothing feels fake, phony or forced about the school scenes. And the music is just as powerful as the film.Of all the Stan Lee cameos in the Marvel films, the one here feels the most organic and perfect. It brought a tear to my eye when he sold Miles the costume and told him that all the costumes eventually fit. Kudos to the producers for remembering both Lee and Steve Ditko at the film's end.In case you didn't pick it up, I give this movie my highest recommendation. While Infinity War may be the best Marvel movie ever, you need to have seen every single Marvel movie ever to get that. This is the kind of film that Becca could watch and enjoy without needing to open a single comic, which is just how she likes it.

The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Cizzurp215","14 December 2018","Visually stunning. Great storyline. Great cast. Amazing soundtrack. Tear jerking cameo. Pop culture post credit scene of the decade. Thank you Marvel and Sony for making a Spidey movie everyone can love.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","rannynm","12 December 2018","What would you do if you could be a superhero? What if you have no choice? From the very beginning, Spider-Man: Into the Spicer-Verse is very energetic and captures your attention. This animated film has impressive visuals. The music creates a fantastic rhythm. And you just want to watch more.The story follows a high school student named Miles Morales, who just changed school. He goes into an abandoned subway station with his uncle Erin and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Ever since that day, Miles starts sticking to everything he touches. Then, he meets Spider-Man (Peter Parker), teams up with some friends from the same dimension and they attempt to save the world from the villain Kingoin.The story is very original and makes the impossible possible. It takes all the abilities of Spider-Man to far and beyond with its action scenes. The film also shows a very real family atmosphere and the humor is smart. I love the non-traditional characters and how they embrace diversity. And yes! Spider-Man is Latino and surely does speak Spanish! There are also some fun new characters.With this film, Marvel has created a film that celebrates comics, film and visual arts. Of course, it celebrates Spider-Man and makes this super hero relevant and contemporary. It is absolutely eye-poppingly beautiful and really pushes the boundaries of the genre with its colors, textures and camera movements. There are several different forms of animation in one film. You feel as if you are actually reading a comic book or the comic book is coming to life.Naturally, the film does a very touching tribute to genius Stan Lee. I feel the filmmakers took some risks bringing new ideas to this iconic character which as been adored for over 50 years. The result is a must-see family movie that is even more appealing to new generations. I also love how this film is animated. It's so different. I've never seen a film like this one. I think it's very unique. Be sure to stay after the credits to see something very special, including another set of credits at the very end.This film sets a new era in animated movies. I recommend it for ages 5 to 18, as well as adults. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and include it in my Oscar predictions as a very possible winner. This is the film parents will love their kids to watch and kids will enjoy in many different ways.With great power comes great responsibility and we all can be heroes. This is the idea behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - inclusion for all in the vast universe and the idea that we can all be heroes by making the right choices and doing our best helping each other in our everyday life.Reviewed by Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","thinslicing","21 December 2018","Updated review 4-9-19I've now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn't for everyone. Let's break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.If we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they're great.The story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.The voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.Shamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I've watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.Chris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.I never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I'm working or doing something else and I'll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.I've always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.The greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. ""The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen"". Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn't use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they're seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it's just simply too much for some people. I get that.As far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren't many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.Original review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.What is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton's dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they're all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that 'feel the most like a comic book', you'd probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.But they aren't literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really 'just cartoons', and I don't mean that in a bad way. They're simply cartoon versions of comic books.Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It's an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.This movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I'm-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.Remember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like ""oh wow! It's a comic book come to life!""? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.But here's the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a ""here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!""My first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I've built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I've gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It's that great.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Sleepin_Dragon","4 July 2023","Even if you're not the biggest fan on Earth of animation, I'd urge you to give this film a try. It has such an incredibly broad appeal, it really does push the boundaries, and perhaps at the point in time that it was made, raise the bar on animation.The story is great, and Shameik Moore does a cracking job as the central hero, but the deal success comes with the animation, it is quite remarkably good, with subsequent viewings you'll spot more and more, it was clearly a labour of love for the team behind it.It is a dazzling, dizzying affair, there is so much happening on, but it's all cohesive, it's not one of those films that leaves you confused and bewildered, it really does come together nicely.Plenty of action, plenty of surprises, I urge you to watch it, and then definitely get and see the mind-blowing follow up.9/10.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","vancewinstead","15 December 2018","This movie was absolutely incredible. From the animation, to the storytelling, to the characters this movie is completely one of a kind. It is easily the best looking animated movie of the year (no surprise there), but what really caught me off guard was the story they were able to tell in such a short amount of time. Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated. I knew I would end up liking this movie, but this movie has completely exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy superheros or animation you should 100% definitely watch it in a theater.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","FairlyAnonymous","4 January 2019","As much as I enjoy this movie (and as an animator/storyartist I love the visuals!) I have to honest and say it is a bit of an unfocused mess. The reason why you should see this movie is because it is the first in what will hopefully be a trend of innovative and creative animated movies that aren't just looking over the shoulders of what Disney and Pixar are doing. This movie is its own creature and I think it deserves to be seen just for the visuals and the opportunity to hopefully support this trend...However, I would only say that if the movie has some substance to it.... which it does. I recommend people see this movie, but it should be noted that I think this movie may be getting the ""Kubo"" treatment where an animated film is visually impressive to such a degree that people gloss over bad writing because everything they are looking at is so cool.The first half of this movie is brilliant. I think just about everything in the first half works really well and is super effective. Miles Morales felt like a real kid with some real kid issues, Peter B Parker was funny, tragic and fleshed out, and Gwen... existed (we'll get to her later). My eyes were glued to the screen and I was excited for where the story would go as I was genuinely surprised at a couple twists and turns in the story.Then, a certain moment happened in the movie where I was taken out of the film and went, ""Wait... oh shoot this is going downhill real fast."" It was the introduction of all of the other spider-verse characters. At that moment the film shifted gears into an entirely different film from the first half. Does Miles Morales fit in with the professionals? Can Miles Morales impress them? Everyone seems to hate him due to his lack of experience! Can Miles Morales take a leap of faith (which he already did in the beginning of the movie)??!?! Is Miles Morales even relevant to the story?!?!?!?! All of these sudden new themes and plot developments completely derail what the first half of the film was setting up to such a degree that it felt like a giant schism cut through the film and the second half of the film was waving goodbye to the first half.I'll be clear that I have no issue with other spider-verse characters sharing screen-time in the film, the issue is that they don't add much in terms of character development or interaction with Miles. The characters should serve to help Miles grow, but in this movie they just seem like another pair of fists to punch bad guys, and there is no better example of this than...Gwen Stacey.Gwen Stacey has the unfortunate issue of being completely irrelevant to the story when she should be an important and vital character to Peter B Parker's/Miles Morales' character growth and should have an arc of her own. This is a character who witnessed Peter Parker (her best friend) die and Peter B Parker is someone who witnessed Gwen Stacey die in her universe! WHY DON'T THEY DISCUSS THIS!!! Peter B Parker should be surprised and excited to see someone he knew as dead alive again and she should be happy to see her best friend once more! Instead, the two characters just... punch bad guys... like everyone else. No growth or development between the two.To make matters worse, Gwen doesn't even really work to help Miles Morales develop as a character. In the beginning of the film she is built up to be one of the main characters, but in the second half she doesn't develop any further than she did in the beginning. She experiences no character growth nor does she help develop any other characters. She just exists in the film.I could go on for a while about all of the different weird pacing issues in the second half of the film such as Miles Morales suddenly getting super powerful and skilled out of nowhere (it's odd that people complain about ""Mary Sues"" in film but don't complain about Miles Morales going from zero to hero in one scene), or a single cut from a comedy scene to a tragic ""friends splitting up"" scene, some loose character threads such as Miles' dad telling cops to chase spider-man but we never see them do it, and many other instances of odd pacing choices and poor juxtapositions of emotional story beats.But, I will end this on a positive note: All of the characters are enjoyable when they get their moment and I think the writing on the father was really good. He wasn't your typical ""larger than life"" father but a very honest, strong, but stubborn dad who has his flaws yet is very likable and reasonable. I wish him and Uncle Aaron had some scenes together and their dynamic was a bit more fleshed out, but as is I still like them regardless of the additional scenes they deserved.Go see it if you want to support innovative and risky animation, but be warned that it is not a perfect film (other than visually).","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","bob the moo","22 September 2019","There was a lot of hype about this film, which surprised me because when I first glanced at the trailer I just dismissed what I saw as a direct-to-TV film. The hype gave me pause but at the same time made me wait so that it had time to settle into reality. Coming to it outside of the hype and awards, I was open to what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. What pleased me was how creative it was in several areas of production. In terms of narrative it took the risk to be silly with its alternative Spider-Men, but was able to balance that with an engaging and reasonably serious core narrative. It managed to be funny, fun, engaging, and enjoyable all the way through.Animation wise it mixed many styles and approaches very well. Even when it felt OTT with the visuals, it still somehow worked and I didn't feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload. The overall design of the film added to this, with good use of music, shot framing, and animation to make it feel very cool and fluid throughout. Production-wise, it felt like it ""got"" the sense of humour of the script and made that work more than it otherwise would have done. Voice performances also seem to get this, and everyone plays their characters well.Overall, it is creative, funny, engaging, and exciting for those that get into it and accept it on its own terms.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","mahmus","21 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of the most beautiful animated movies I've seen and possibly the best looking superhero movie of all time; with its bright neon colors combined with its comic book asthetic, it creates a world unlike anything I've seen since the LEGO Movie.
The characters are all great. Miles Morales is a fantastic protagonist; understandably scared at the prospect of being Spider-Man, but excited to learn. His relationship with his father and Peter Parker are some of the most emotiinal scenes in the movie. Gwen Stacy is also a great supporting character, as are thr rest of the spider people.
The villains are fun and the action is jaw dropping.
It's also tear jerking tribute to Stan Lee.
This is the best Spider-Man movie by far.","10/10"

The twists, you never see coming and don't even get me started on how beautiful the end fight scene was. This film is the best animated film of 2018 and in my opinion, the best film of 2018 definitely worth seeing!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Anurag-Shetty","16 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse tells the story of Miles Morales(Shameik Moore). When Miles becomes the Spider-Man of his universe, he meets various versions of the wall-crawler from parallel universes. Now, all the Spideys must team up to put an end to a danger, that could alter reality in terrible ways.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film. Directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman & writer Phil Lord, have given us the best big screen adaptation of Spider-Man & that's saying something. I love the fact that this movie, makes us feel nostalgic about the previous big screen adaptations of Spider-Man. The animation is awe-inspiring. The comic book format of the animation is unique & is perfect for one of the most loved comic book characters. The 3D is amazing(watch this film on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX). The action set pieces, the humour & the emotional scenes are perfectly balanced, throughout. The voice-over work is unforgettable. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Moore brings that much needed vulnerability to his character. Jake Johnson is outstanding as Peter B. Parker. Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Mahershala Ali is perfect as Uncle Aaron. Brian Tyree Henry is excellent as Jefferson Davis. John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn & Nicolas Cage are awesome as Spider-Ham, Peni Parker & Spider-Man Noir, respectively. Kathryn Hahn & Liev Schreiber are superb as Doc Ock & Wilson Fisk, respectively. Lily Tomlin, Luna Lauren Velez, Zoe Kravitz & Chris Pine are great as Aunt May, Rio Morales, Mary Jane & Peter Parker, respectively. Everything about Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is jaw-dropping! A must watch. Swing by your nearest multiplex, immediately!","7/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","chriscarlisle25","15 December 2018","I knew that this movie would be good from the first moment I heard about it last year, and it did not disappoint me one bit. It met all of my expectations, and then went above and beyond them. The animation is a blend of CGI, stop animation, pop/comic book art and realism. The vibrant colors pop out at you, and the action sequences really enthrall. A very captivating and beautiful piece of art is this movie, and the writing choices leave nothing to be desired. The story is that of the traditional starting superhero with a bunch of twists thrown in. The movie itself actually follows past comics for the most part, with some minor changes here and there. A true Spider-Man, or comic book fan in general, will not have anything to criticize in this movie. Everything that fans want to see out of Spidey(s) is in this movie. There are multiple different variations of Spider-Man in the film, and all of them have their special moments to shine. The end credit scene just rockets this movie up past my already positive expectations, and it gets a 10/10 from me! The movie can be enjoyed by both young and old alike, and trust me, it will blow your mind! Best animated film of 2018, and one of the best superhero movies ever made. It deserves any and all awards and kudos it will surely garner.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","educallejero","25 February 2019","The movie is visually spectacular (with the exceptions of a handful of blurry scenes filled with blues and reds, maybe for 3D purposes?). The colours and character designs are gorgeous. The dynamics of the action and the camera work is superb. All of this is ""all time great"" level.But... The story is ultra basic, therefore quite boring for about 45 impossibly predictable minutes. The jokes, while clever for a movie for kids, just didn't make me laugh. Not even one time. I'm not sure why. Also, the story lacks all kinds of depths. It's literally no sense, but I don't think is the focus of the movie, because...What really works is the theme of the film. Everybody can ""wear the mask"". And they proved it by showing it, not depending on melodramatic and cliched monologues, but with the story itself, that included different versions of totally different people ""wearing the masks"".The emotional bits also work well and kind of justify the boring preparation for it, developing Miles Morales origin story and his family and problems really well. Simple, but well done.
For last, the villains and its plans are just almost pointless and beyond under developed. There was probably no enough time to give them better and more coherent plans.
A good movie, visually superior with a well done and coherent message that actually works in the story (sometimes these superhero movies contradict themselves and they are about the ""problem with violence""... by using violence to solve the problem. No here. Spiderman is not white, black, female, old or young. It can be anybody. And they are good).","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","kjproulx","11 December 2018","Growing up, I grew an appreciation for the character of Spider-Man that I've never been able to develop for any other comic book character. It was Sam Raimi's original live-action trilogy that hooked me and had me scrounging for more. Watching countless episodes of every cartoon iteration, and even starting to read a few of the comics, I found myself becoming a huge fan of this generational icon. Once Spider-Man 3 hit theatres, the character had lost all hope on the big screen, until Andrew Garfield took the role from Tobey Maguire, which didn't last too long, and also crashed and burned. Finally, he found his footing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Tom Holland, but none of that matters when watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Not only is this the best that this character has been in a while, but I believe there's a real argument to made that this is possibly the greatest feature-length film based on this character, period.In this film, which is loosely based off of storylines that are very similar to how this movie plays out, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse follows Miles Morales as he's bitten by a radioactive spider and develops the same (and more) powers as his hero, Spider-Man. After an event opens a portal, it's revealed that his universe isn't the only one. There are endless dimensions out there with parallel characters and creatures, all with similar backstories. From Spider-Gwen to Spider-Ham, this film explores the classics as well as the bizarre, which I fear will probably turn off some average moviegoers who haven't experienced these characters yet, but if you can't embrace a film like that, it's probably not for you anyways.From the very first teaser trailer, I was very intrigued by the look of this film and how different it looked from most animated films out there today. With only a couple of notable films in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Arthur Christmas, Sony Pictures hasn't had the best track record in terms of releasing animated movies theatrically. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has given new life to that notion, because this isn't only the best they've ever produced in my opinion, but it's the best animated movie that has come out all year. The unique style leaps off the screen and made me find another layer to love, on top of the fantastic storyline and characters surrounding it.Yes, the origin story of Peter Parker is the one that everyone knows. That is very much present here again, and nearly every one of these characters share similar backgrounds, but it feels as though the filmmakers expect the audience to be in on the joke of that. This movie is very meta at times, and it works very well if you're invested in the movie as a whole. At the emotional core of this movie is how these characters differ from one another and how certain circumstances can be worse than others. There are some fantastic life lessons to be learned by children here, and for that, I only loved this movie even more.In the end, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse impressed me on many levels. It gives you the Spider-Man action that you've come to expect from this character, as well as giving new life to it. The character of Miles Morales has just as many layers to his story as the classic Peter Parker one, but the inclusion of each one of the side characters here fleshes him out even more. This is one of the best superhero origin stories I've seen on the big screen in years. Filled with heart, emotion, plenty of action, and eye-candy as far as the eye can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of my favourite films of the year.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","jackgdemoss","17 December 2018","This film was phenomenal for so many reasons. First and most importantly, it was the most visually impressive film I have seen to this day. The animation style alone had such a mystical and wonderous quality to it. The animators didn't stop there, however. They added so many little fun details that made me feel like I was watching some sort of blend between comic and movie. In addition to the gorgeous visual nature of Spider-Man, I was impressed by both the humor and the meta references. The reference to the cringey Spider-Man 3 scene and the post-credits meme reference were my personal favorites. There were tons of little details that I am sure I never truly appreciated because I have never been a consumer of comic books, but I have to imagine that this film is even more special to Marvel comic fans. The only gripe that I have with Spider-Man is that it failed to keep my attention in act 3. It was longer than it should have been, and it would have benefited greatly by cutting down 10 minutes. With that being said, this is the best movie I have seen in a few months and I hope that my review reaches someone who was not going to see it and urges them to reconsider.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","TheMovieDoctorful","18 December 2018","I've waited 4 years to love Spider-Man this much. From comics to movies to video games, the last Spider-Man related story that I truly loved was the divisive Marc Webb movie, The Amazing Spider-Man 2. However, 2018 has really turned things around for my favorite Marvel superhero; from his groundbreaking video game for the PS4 to the brilliant Nick Spencer taking the reigns from the incompetent Dan Slott in the comics. Hell, even the MCU's depiction of Spider-Man (Which I despised in both Civil War and Homecoming) was surprisingly enjoyable in Infinity War, despite my thoughts on the rest of the film. The resurgence in quality Spider-Man stories continues with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; perhaps the best superhero film since 2004's Spider-Man 2.The voice cast couldn't have been better. I've been saying how Shameik Moore would make a perfect Miles Morales ever since I saw him in Dope and he doesn't disappoint here. Much like Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn or J.K Simmons J.J Jameson, Shameik Moore IS Miles Morales as far as I'm concerned. He nails Morales ambition, his selflessness, his emotional vulnerability and his overall shyness in one of my favorite comic book movie performances ever. You could not have picked a better actor for this role.Jake Johnson as an older, more broken (But still witty) Spider-Man who's lost his way was unexpected, but really interesting. Johnson is funny and charismatic, but has a real emotional pathos to him that takes his performance to the next level. He may actually be my favorite cinematic acting performance for Peter Parker He's a surprisingly complex character for a more family-targeted Spider-Man film and Johnson handles Parker's ascent from washed up has-been to the Spidey we all know and love wonderfully.Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir is a joy to listen to whenever he's on screen. His deliciously hammy New York accent firing off witty 1930s one liners is something never knew I needed so badly. I found myself smiling pretty much every time he spoke. It's a smaller role, but by God, Cage absolutely does his thing and it benefits this wacky, incredibly imaginative movie wonderfully.All of the characters here feel so real and human. Miles' strong sense of honor and commitment to the ideals of his role models make him such a likable and easy-to-root for lead. Long before Miles dons his iconic red & black hoodie costume from the comics, he fully embodies the selflessness, compassion and empathy that make Spider-Man such an inspirational and iconic character. I can totally understand why his kindness and capacity for good inspire Jake Johnson's Spider-Man to return to his heroic and altruistic ways he had long since abandoned. The film really does an excellent job of testing Miles' will power, the sincerity of his innate goodness, putting him through the ringer emotionally as he suffers insurmountable, but staggeringly human, losses. This is the kind of Spider-Man that I wanted to be when I grew up. The character journey that Peter Parker goes through here is easily the most nuanced and layered he's experienced in a movie. From the deadbeat loser we see in the first act, to the hopeless martyr of the second to our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man we witness in the third, the sheer depth (And natural pace) of Spider-Man's development here is something I honestly never thought the screenwriting duo of Lord & Rothman were capable of. Even with villains and minor characters like Kingpin, Uncle Aaron and Miles' father Officer Davis are all characters whose hopes, dreams, fears and ambitions are all things I could easily describe.Much like Suicide Squad, the film makes the wise decision of using its vast and diverse gallery of characters to bring in a wondrous array of different visual styles. We have the urban graffiti style of Miles Morales, the 60s Marvel style of Peter Benjamin Parker, the Marvel Now! style of Spider-Gwen, the Golden Age comics style of Spider-Man: Noir, the Acme style of Spider-Ham and the anime style of Peni Parker. It's no secret that the film's core message is that anyone with a big spine and a bigger heart can be Spider-Man, but what makes Into the Spider-Verse so impressive is that, like the best comic books, it conveys this all visually. Every one of these different styles gets their own spot in the sunlight and I feel that every viewer will find a style here that really touches them on a personal level, just as each viewer is likely to find a Spider-Man here who they can relate too and resonate with emotionally. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse isn't merely a great comic book movie, it's a comic book brought to life.I'll always have appreciation for soundtracks that really capture the musical tastes of a specific generation. They almost act as cultural time capsules of the time in which they were released. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse very much fits this description, featuring some of the best and most atmospheric songs of Post Malone, Juice Wrld, Seezyn, XXTentacion, Swae Lee and Annuel AE's careers. I haven't loved a soundtrack to a comic book movie this much since Spawn. Just like that film, Into The Spider-Verse's soundtrack really captures the musical atmosphere of the late 2010s. It just set such an emotional tone for the film, one that's very much earned with this excellent and moving screenplay.Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse is easily the best superhero film of 2018 and its place as the 2nd best Marvel film to date is unlikely to be unseated by anything else. It's a must see for anyone with even a remote love for the character and it completely makes up for the terrible depictions of Spider-Man in both Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming. It's nice to see my faith (Or, relative faith over Marvel studios, at least) rewarded.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","jeannefrancoise","15 December 2018","Dear Marvel fans, since I knew Spider Gwen is dubbed by my idol Hailee Steinfeld, I really wanted to watch this Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse movie. Then happily I did watch it and my review is just short: This movie is a fascinating graphic that please your eyes! Take a very big applause for artistic department and all team that make the idea of parallel universe could be combined with the original story of Spiderman. The identity, friendship, battles, family relations of Peter Parker became clear enough for the whole story of Spiderman series itself. How we ever knew about him, what is going on in his world, and when Spiderman transform himself to be a hero, is explained more here, and with the special appearances of Kingpin and his villain team, the director could lead the plots into the fun way for everybody. This is not just ordinary cartoon, but the highly qualified design graphic with the exact scenes, special effects, and bubble conversation like a moving comic-book. Every details in this animation is clearly edited by professional film-makers with any mistakes, nor any flaws. Even for Spiderman fans, this movie is so fresh to be watched and stays in his original starting point. No matter how many Spiderman movies could ever be made, this Spiderverse perhaps the first sci-fi animation I've ever watched and what a fascinating graphic to win Golden Globe very soon. And yes, I listen carefully of what Spider Gwen said because it is dubbed by my idol, Hailee Steinfeld, who will win many awards ahead. Thank you producer, director, casts, and crew to deliver this amazing movie to us.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","tavm","10 January 2019","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his adult nephew. We all were enthralled by the tale of the various Spider-Heroes depicted in this film especially the main one of Miles Morales. Some of the backgrounds looked like what a 3-D movie would look like without wearing the glasses which confused me to think I needed them but then the front scenes were clear so I then knew I didn't. Great visuals and story. Also, nice extended cameo by co-creator Stan Lee and touching since this was released after his passing. Nice of the credits sequence to also dedicate the movie in memory of him and other co-creator Steve Ditko. So that's a very high recommendation of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Zephrey","13 December 2018","I'm blown away, this movie is absolutely beautiful. The animation is stunning, the soundtrack is amazing and the dialogue and storyline is so heart-warming.
The characters are memorable, they all bring their own emotions rubbing off on the audience, and the humor is right on, its daring and hilarious and doesn't seem forced like you might see in some of the MCU films.
There's been 7 Spider-Man films in the last 16 years and this might be the best one yet, its pays its respect to the past films while driven on its own storyline adventure, being such a known character the movies still comes out as original.
The cinematography and animation are gorgeous, definitely oscar worthy. I'd say this is one of the best superhero origins movies ever made. Then there's the numerous amount of easter eggs, be on the lookout for those.
I can't say the movies underrated cause its be treated just as it should be, but if there's one thing that its underrated its the soundtrack, the funny thing is the soundtrack is the exact type of music Miles Morales would listen to, so I guess you could say there's a touch of realism.
In the end all I can see is go see this movie for yourselves, the visual experience is amazing, its touching and serious, funny and witty, brings more emotion than some of the superhero movies you'll see today and best of all if your sick of superhero movies this is a complete different and fresh start of the genre. (Don't forget to wait till the end of the credits)","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Thekeybaldemasterrises","7 December 2018","Edit: I see a lot of people have already thumbed down this review because it sounds like people are playing the race card with this movie. ""Peter Parker is the only Spider-Man!!"" Look watch the movie for yourself, or don't see it at all. If you're really that bothered by a black Spider-Man in this movie then why are you here reading reviews? You still have the Rami films and heck you still have the Garfield films if that's what floats your boat. If you really care about good storytelling and good animation then hear me out.
Into the Spider-Verse is the hour of redemption for Sony's animation studio. I haven't been particularly happy with their recent films ranging from endless Hotel Transylvania sequels, constant remakes of the Smurfs, and of course the god awful Emoji Movie. I kept asking myself, when Sony? When will you actually use your creative talents and give us something worth our time? And folks, this is it. This is their baby. Into the Spider-Verse is not only one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best Spider-Man films period. I was skeptical at first too, the high ratings, the complex story, the studio, but thankfully the reviews were right on this. What this movie does so well is how it constantly engages its audience through visual storytelling. It reflects the same methods Stan Lee/Steve Ditko used when they wrote their comic stories all those years ago. You can tell the filmmakers did their homework and really captured the comic book esthetic to a whole other level. It's colorful, it's full of amazing textures, and the action is just amazing to watch. Now if the movie solely relied on this I probably would've given it a lower rating but thankfully they wrote a nice story here. We get to finally see Miles Morales come to life and while I didn't think he had the most interesting personality compared to say Peter Parker, he worked as a vessel for the audience. We got to see his Spider-Man journey in a very unique and interesting way that feels nostalgic but fresh at the same time. I do have to add that I didn't quite feel the emotional weight in this film with Miles' character arc like I did in Tobey's Spider-Man 2, but it was still emotionally satisfying for this film on its own when you don't compare it to previous films. In the end, this was still my favorite Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2. It's funny, fun, and full of heart. I would be ok with Sony owning the license to Spider-Man if they kept making movies with this animation style but still carry some depth and passion in the storytelling. Because this movie honored the most endearing thing about Spider-Man's story, and it's that anyone can wear the mask. It's that universal trait that Steve Ditko and Stan Lee created all those years ago that make this character so mythological and so palpable. And this has one of Stan's best cameos yet I promise you that. If you're a Spidey fan, or just a comic fan, or even just a fan of animated films. YESSS GO SEE IT. This is my favorite animated film of the year, if not in years, and might potentially creep into my top 10 films of the year. PLEASE GO SUPPORT THIS. 9/10.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","DarkVulcan29","21 December 2018","The film is like a comic book come to life, I mean that's the look the filmmakers where looking for. Attempts to be two things at once, a Spider Man film and a sort of parody of a Spider Man film. It does have heart, and never goes to far into silliness. The animation is really amazing, takes the audience into this world. And I was wondering when we where gonna see the other Spider characters, and here we finally do and it was worth it.
I hope we more movies with the characters of Spider Gwen, Miles Morales, and Spider Man Noir to name a few. It has a great story, telling us about things in case we get stuck in sub plot. Now I it differs a little from the comic. But I expect a lot of times in comic book movies. Hope to see more Spider Verse movies in the future.","6/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","darthakam","21 December 2018","Heads-up: I'm only going to be talking about Peter Parker in this review. I'll make a separate one for the film laterm I just feel like he deserves his own review. That's how great Peter is in this film.Into The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.I used to love Spiderman as a kid. I got obssessed with the cartoons he starred in as well as the original movie trilogy, one that actually helped me get interested in the character and marvel as a whole. But my love for this character, as most things, dissolved and it never got around to build itself up again, even after constant remakes and wonderful performances. I never felt that spark again, that love I felt for this charming dude was gone, dead.Then Into The Spider-verse came, and my whole world turned upside down. I felt a fire inside my stomach. There it was, that long-forgotten love for Peter Parker, one that I thought I would never experience again, expanding continuously as the movie progressed, hitting me in all the right places.I'd even dare to say that this movie made me understand the reason as to why spider-man is universally loved:He's an everyday guy with super powers, that's it. He's flawed but pure at heart. He's relatable. He belongs to the people. He's one of us.This movie's fresh take on Peter Parker is exactly what we needed to fully grasp that, how compelling this character can be without using any of his super powers. This version of Peter Parker is fat, subtly depressed, and tired, yet he's the most charming and lovable version of this character yet. It's something we haven't seen in quite a while, the genuine humanity that makes Peter Parker such a charismatic character, and one can only be thankful for it.Spider-man is cool again, but in a totally different, and perhaps even better, way. Just your everyday dude taking a leap of faith, giving the audience who relates to his struggles courage to do the same. This is what Spiderman can be and what he should be. A character that's ours, a character that teaches you that anyone can be a hero, that's the real Spiderman. This is the true Homecoming. Spiderman is freaking back! Welcome home!","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","cardsrock","23 December 2018","I've long thought that Spider-Man 2 was the gold standard for Spider-Man movies. I think it's safe to say that Into the Spider-Verse gives it a run for its money. Everything about this film, the beautiful animation, voice-acting, character development, and music are top notch. You can tell that the people behind this movie actually care about Spider-Man and care about their craft. From hilarious references to touching storytelling, this movie is just a joy to watch. It's such a unique addition to the genre and indicates that as long as talented people are involved in making these films, the superhero genre will continue to reinvent itself.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","ninjaboyballer","19 December 2018","I gotta day I thought this movie was going to suck because of that awful emoji movie by Sony. Boy was I wrong. This probably my favorite spider man movie. It as great characters, great comic book action, great emotional moments, great animation. I also liked in some particular scenes they were down for using violence. In the movie a character gets crushed and another one gets shot. Although it didn't actually show any blood or anything, it's still a bit over the top for a PG movie. But I'm glad they had the balls to do that. It also feels like your watching an actual comic book. Like they have those sound effects like when spider man thwips his webs and when characters punch and kick each other and explosions go off. It feels like a panel of a comic come to life. I also like how they make peter and Gwen's backstories hilariously sad. This is actually a pretty funny movie. I was suprised that this movie was funny. I also like they have journeys for the two main characters that are wrapped up by the end of the film. This film also shows how the character of spider man is so inspirational and important. How he matters not just to the marvel universe but how he relates to people who read his stories. And the post credits scene is probably my favorite of this year. Wait till the end to see it. I pretty much loved everything about this movie except probably Kingpin. He was underdeveloped a lot and I wish he was given more to do. Overall though, Spider man into the spider verse is a blast of a film and I am going to give it a 9.7/10","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Semisonic","10 March 2019","Most of us have dreams. Not the ones about having a billion bucks or getting that girl, but the night time ones. So most of us would agree that in that twilight zone our brain unleashes its creativity, no longer bound by the constraints of reality, and that allows us to dream the most crazy and amazing stuff. And most bizarre and incoherent also. Especially if there were some substances consumed beforehand.In that sense, I'd agree with those who say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an animation film we could dream for. I'm far from the comic book culture, but even I can admire the visual style of this film, made so that any still out of it could actually pass for a real comic book's frame. That aesthetics is brilliantly done, no questions about it.The rest of admiration, however, heavily depends on how much you are into TV cartoons, comic books and Spider-Man himself. This film loves to reiterate over and over again that it's based on an established universe, so there's an abundance of Spider-Man movie references and other allusions. If such things make you gasp in awe and maybe even shed a tear of nostalgic affection, you'll love it all. But for me as a non-Spider-man-acolyte, this soon became somewhat boring. I wanted to see something new, something unexpected.And something new I did receive! In the form of a slapstick action multiplied by the pseudo-scientific stuff as grotesquely absurd as it was far-fetched. And I can clearly see how Sony was inspired by the likes of Big Hero 6 and its outright fusion of the Western and Eastern kid entertainment culture, and of Ant-man and even Dr. Strange and their abundance of moving colored specks and nonsensical words in lieu of common sense. The deeper we go into the Spider-Verse, the more bizarre it looks, feels and acts, until we're forced to accept that there are no rules anymore to cling to and that pigs can indeed fly, just as trains.I do appreciate bringing a new stylistic vision into the world of full feature animation. But I can't say as much about bringing a popcorn bucket of LSD along with it, turning everything into a final battle from Final Fantasy, with its constant sparkle and rush and a muffled feeling that it used to mean something, but now you can't remember what exactly and it's way too late to stop and think about it.It was a fascinating trip while it lasted, but praising it as something more than that would be like retelling your dreams to someone else: you'd end up realizing how little sense your words make and feeling embarrassed about the whole idea.","10/10"

Well.. I certainly did!This was amazing on almost ever level! There was a great story and character arc about accepting the responsebility, not having to do everything yourself and that failure comes with the job! I got quite emotional a couple of times! I enjoyed the characters and villains as well! They have motives we can understand!However.. despite all that, the most groundbreaking part of this movie, has to be... the animation!

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","OnjiMooteDaMarle","15 March 2019","It started of well and I knew by the trailer what I was going to expect. I was waiting for something beyond my expectation but when it became weirder it definitely became a lot weirder. If you have seen episodes of The Flash, this film's story feels like meh. Apart from the dialogues, it's definitely bad writing. The main character is completely clueless about being spider-man but when the writers need him to use his skills, voila!, he knows it all, like the back of his hand.People who say this is the most visually stunning film they have ever seen are those who haven't seen films. All those who have given this a rating standing at 8 point something have been blown over the visuals of this film which is great but every film's basic foot lies in it's screenplay. This is sloppy writing. Aunt May being kind of Iron Man and all. There is a moment in every new super hero film where the hero falls short of confidence and then a few scenes or a lot of scenes later the confidence is regained. Here it happens in the very next scene. What a load of BS. Spider-man sticky web sticks to his hand easily and is a disturbance for him but it is conveniently easy for the villain to break that sticky webAnd Nicoles Cage..Are you kidding me...His way of talking makes it irritatingly meme funny. Depressing. His character was a complete waste.But definitely much better than Captain Marvel.
This film is visually stunning and the animation is excellent. Kudos to the animation artists. But the writers need to write better.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","classicsoncall","2 January 2019","Uh-oh, I feel a 'here I go again' coming. As I write this, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is ranked #29 on IMDb's list of Top 250 movies of all time, right there in between ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""L√©on: The Professional"". Among the eighty plus comic-book based super-hero movies I've seen and reviewed, it comes in at #2, right behind ""The Dark Knight"", which means viewers give it a higher rating than ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", if any of you Marvel fans care about that. I don't know, I just think there's just something askew about that, instinctively telling me that in this case, it's not the quality of the movie that places it so high in the rankings, but the overall popularity and buzz that attaches itself to the film. But enough of that.I actually thought the film was OK, not great, but OK. As far as animated movies go, I thought it was exceptionally rendered with bright, vivid colors and an interesting cast of characters, some of whom I was familiar with and others not. I actually do remember Spider-Ham from the dark recesses of my memory long ago. As far as the story line goes, it wasn't particularly new or innovative, how many threats to reality have you encountered over the course of your movie viewing lives? If it sounds like I'm trashing the flick, I'm not really, I think it's great for kids and fans of animated movies. Speaking of which, and relative to my argument above, the picture is outranked by the Japanese anime ""Spirited Away"" on the current Top 250 at Number #27, so I'm not bashing the picture for not being live action.My biggest kick out of watching the movie, and I make this statement a lot about Marvel based comic book movies, was seeing writer and artist Stan Lee drawn into the film as a store clerk named appropriately enough, 'Stan'. With his recent passing at the age of ninety five, it saddens me to know that I won't be seeing him in those ubiquitous cameo spots that I always look for in a Marvel super-hero film. As one of the original creators of Spider-Man along with Steve Ditko (who also passed away in 2018), I'd like to think that Stan Lee got his own special preview showing of ""Into the Spider-Verse"" before he entered Valhalla. He is one that will be missed.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Platypuschow","22 March 2019","Where could I even dream to begin on this one? An animated Spiderman film that sits at time of writing as the 41st highest rated movie on IMDB and won an Oscar? Who'd have thought such a thing was possible?So the movie has been hyped left, right, center and diagonally, I've literally not heard one single bad thing about it but the facts mentioned above left me stunned! What could this possibly be to be heralded in such a way?Telling the story of a young man who is also bitten by a radioactive spider and develops superpowers. Kingpins latest dastardly scheme is tearing the fabrics of reality apart and alternate universe versions of Spiderman have all ended up in the same universe. I'm sure you can work out what happens next.So the animation style is a tweak on Pixar, it plays out like a comic book and call me weird but that certainly didn't work for me. The animation doesn't flow fluidly, it looks hokey, disjointed and I found myself frustrated by it.The plot is a novel concept and I liked it, the delivery however I did not. Certain aspects make very little sense, sure it's a Spiderman film so I'm not supposed to think about it too much but I did and my conclusions were migraine inducing stupidity. Did I say stupidity? Oh the stupid doesn't end there sadly, I get the multiverse concept of anything is possible but their Spiderman variant choices were bafflingly dumb and what you'd expect from a Saturday morning cartoon not a blockbuster film!It tries to be heartfelt, but comes across half-assed.
It tries to be funny, but comes across childish.
It tries to be action packed but the style of animation didn't allow it to be done justice.Okay I'm slating the film right now so it probably sounds like I hated it, which I didn't. 6/10 is a fair rating and suggests its above average and it is. But I'm annoyed at the acclaim that's it's been bathed in.8.6 rating on IMDB are you kidding me? And the Oscars have lacked credibility in my eyes for years because of their ridiculous bias and genre-snubbing but this right here is the last bit of credibility up in smoke. I'm not saying a superhero movie shouldn't be Oscar worthy, but this silly cartoon simply isn't (And neither is Black Panther but I'll resist the urge to rant).Into the Spider-Verse to me is no different than all the straight to DVD Marvel and DC efforts we see a couple of each year. The only difference here is the animation style, nothing else sets it apart.I just don't get the appeal.The Good:Some great writingGreat ideaThe Bad:Animation hardly flowsUnexpectedly sillyPlot holes that are unforgivably stupid","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","andrewroy-04316","6 April 2019","I think this one is mostly ""on me"", as someone who never read comic books growing up and enjoys the ideas that movies leave me with, not the visual experience as much. Spider-Verse is undeniably creative and unique, particularly in its animation, which I think is the best I've ever seen, and the premise is a self-aware and original breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. The voice acting is good, and the comedy is pretty good (though I found the jokes revolving around Miles being young and being goofy in learning his powers to be trite and overplayed). While I was ready to love it, many plot points left me scratching my head and there was no sense of any real stakes. Among the frustrating plot points to me were the absurdity of the 3 new spider people, especially Porky (why? How does that make any sense?); the uncle coincidentally being the person working for Kingpin and tasked with chasing down Spider-Man; Kingpin's backstory scene, where we are following Miles escaping and out of nowhere cut to a memory of Kingpin's family dying after having no background on him at all, just felt very out of place and poorly edited; and other minor points. The story was quite predictable and followed a rote story arc, which contributed significantly to the sense that the outcome was never in doubt, keeping my emotional investment and engagement low throughout. In classic deus ex machina form, Miles struggled and gradually is improving in using his powers, and then right after his dad talks to him he magically has complete control and can win all the fights, is a beast out of nowhere? It had done such a good job of showing his struggles in being valued and succeeding in his tasks, so the flipped switch of him effortlessly and suddenly being powerful was a disservice to the rest of the movie. Thematically, it didn't feel like anything unique, as a standard coming of age story and with a message that anyone can be a superhero. It pays obvious and honest homage to the comic book form, more genuinely adapting the style than any movie I've seen before. It did many things really well, but the various plot point frustrations and the lack of emotional investment due to the lack of stakes made it a forgettable, if pleasant, movie experience for me. I certainly recommend it to others, as at minimum you'll get a fun, amusing and visually gorgeous movie and if you like the comic book style, it could be an all time great.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","ThunderKing6","14 December 2018","What a superb Movie.In coming into this movie I was blank. I know much about Spiderman but I don't know enough. Not sure if any of this movie is accurate or not although this movie was really good.This movie is about Miles becoming a new Spiderman, adapting to his ability and trying to get the other Spidermen back to their universes.The animation was only a problem at the beginning for like 30 second then i got use to it.A few popular spiderman villains show up. The main Lead Villain is none other than the Kingpin who is basically trying to do what Cable did in Deadpool 2 movie but he is more sinister because the movie portrays him like such. He was able to over power 3 spider mans while giant Green Goblin struggled.Pacing in this movie was great, time went by fast because it was such a great film.We got to see various spiderman's from other universes. 2 Of which I think were forced in my opinion.The scene where Miles find out about the Prowler is probably the best scene in the movie.To conclude great movie. One of Sony-Marvels best since Spiderman 2. Its a fun flick for children who would understand the concept of universes and Spiderman fans.Again I know enough spiderman but not enough to say I'm a spiderman fan. Iunno which parts were accurate or not to the comics if that matters.9 out 10 because 2 of the spiderman's seemed forced.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","sweidman-28016","15 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Review:Into the Spider-Verse is a new Sony animated movie about Miles Morales, a Spider-Man, who discovers multiple versions of Spider-Man from different dimensions after an experiment gone wrong. I absolutely love Spider-Man. He is my favorite character of all time so I was super excited for this. I loved Into the Spider-Verse! Everything was definitely thought through very carefully, taking into consideration all the comics and backstories for each character. The story was amazing. It was trippy and just fantastic. It wasn't really predictable for the most part which is really good. The voice acting was really good. Shameik Moore as Miles was by far the best part. His emotion was really good and you could feel for him like you knew Miles. Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker was really good. I thought that Spider-Man was funny and just enjoyable. Mahershala Ali as Uncle Aaron was very good. Mahershala is just a really good actor and if was cool to hear him voice acting. Brian Tyree Henry player Jefferson Davis and he was a great voice actor for Miles's father. All the characters had great development. There were three Spider-Men that came later on that I really liked but didn't have too much exposition on them, but it made sense for them not to have to much. Throughout the film when we meet all the Spider-Men they do exposition on them and they do it in a comedic way and for those three they didn't need to go too deep so it worked. Also the villain of the story, King Pin, had a great design and looked like a good villain but he kind of failed a little. I could see his views after his backstory was revealed but I wanted just a little more out of him. This film had some of the best animation I've ever seen. They made it like a comic book and it looked beautiful. Also the movie is a bit trippy so some of the scenes were just beautiful looking. I could talk about this movie for a long while but I don't want to get into spoilers. If you love Marvel and Spider-Man there is no way to be disappointed. I would recommend it for sure. It'll be nominated for Best Animated Feature for the Oscars (it was nominated for the Golden Globes). It's now hard to say if this or Incredibles 2 will win. This movie has higher ratings but Incredibles 2 is Disney and they almost always win. Once again see it! I absolutely loved Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse!!!My Grade: A","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","masonsaul","16 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse is an absolute masterpiece and easily the best Spider-Man film of all time. A funny, emotional and fresh story that plays with the tropes of an origin story to great effect. It also maintains clear focus on Miles yet still manages to give all the other Spider-people plenty to do whilst exploring the inspiring message that anyone can be Spider-Man and of course, redefining animation forever.Shameik Moore imbues his version of Miles Morales with a loveable awkwardness that matures into a crowd pleasing confidence, resulting in one of the most satisfying character arcs of recent memory. Jake Johnson is perfect as Peter B. Parker, with an equally satisfying arc as well as a humour and vulnerability that make him one of the best renditions of Spider-Man.Rounding out the main trio is Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy, closed off without being cold and the most mature of all the Spider-people. The rest of the cast are a lot of fun with John Mulaney and Nicolas Cage being the most memorable, playing exactly to the strengths you want them to.Rodney Rothman, Peter Ramsey and Bob Persichetti craft a beautiful film, the animation style is so unique and full of detail in every frame whilst staying true to its comic book roots as a comic book come to life. The pacing is also extremely impressive, managing to balance all these characters as well as a rogues gallery and do it all in under 2 hours.The music by Daniel Pemberton and the score are both incredible, both are given the time to shine at the right moments without overshadowing the other and Pemberton's score is unlike anything you've ever heard previously that starts strong and never gives up.","5/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","SnoopyStyle","23 February 2019","Peter Parker has been happily the one and only Spider-Man saving the city over and over again for the last ten years. Miles Morales hates his new school although he is taken with fellow new student Gwen Stacy. His policeman father tries to keep him away from troubled Uncle Aaron. He stumbles upon a battle between Spider-Man and Wilson Fisk with his henchmen, Green Goblin and Prowler. A portal is opened between the Spider-Verse.I really like Miles Morales. He's great with Gwen Stacy. The hair bit is hilarious. I'm over the moon for the first act. My first instinct is to have Jake Johnson play both Peter Parker. He's better acting as a slacker but if he could play the first Peter Parker, it would more compelling to see the change. The other issue is Gwen Stacy. She shows up before the incident. The movie explains it away as time travel but it would be better if it simply switched a couple of scenes. Overall, this is fun, imaginative, and glorious animation. It is also a great introduction to different Spider characters and holds potential for the live action movie world.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","The-Sarkologist","6 November 2021","I'm not really all that much into the animated Superhero films, but apparently this one was supposed to be pretty good so I decided to check it out. Honestly, it didn't really grab me all that much, no doubt because there are already quite a lot of Spiderman movies out there, and as such another one, in particularly an animated one, isn't really going to grab my attention. Look, it was okay, but in a way I do feel that there are probably too many Spiderman films around as it is.The story is that we follow a kid named Miles who happens to be starting up at a school for the gifted. He really doesn't want to go though namely because all of his friends are at a local public school, but he has won a scholarship there so his parents pretty much force him to go. The thing is that Spiderman is already running around, however one night when Miles is out with his uncle, he gets bit by a spider and starts to develop spiderman powers.Miles decides to go back and check the place out and discovers Spiderman fighting a nasty monster, and also attempting to turn off a device that Kingpin has built. The device opens a gate to the dimensions, and the reason that Kingpin wants it open is because he wants his family back (they were killed in a car accident).With the gate open, we suddenly have multiple spiderpeople coming from multiple dimensions, including a Peter Parker who is not only much older, but also has had his life pretty much head down the drain. Sure, he wants to stay, but the problem is that because he is from another dimension, they only has a limited amount of time here until they die.I'm probably giving too much away here anyway, but the thing is that in part the animation was nice, but it also became rather esoteric in places, especially the final battle with Kingpin. That actually makes me wonder whether we are actually going to see Kingpin in any of the films, particularly the MCU ones. Then again, there is apparently only one more Spiderman film being released, so what happens after that is yet to be seen. Anyway, that certainly doesn't look like Kingpin will be appearing in that one anyway.So, this film was okay, but it certainly didn't grab me the way some other films have.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","CubsandCulture","16 December 2018","This is among the best films of the year and I really don't know what is the best part of it. The screenplay deftly interweaves a compelling origin story for a hero while deconstructing the notion of the monomyth while grappling with the cultural weight of Spider-Man. The screenplay is sharp, funny and emotionally resonant. Miles is a great character. Not a mere clone of Peter Parker but a person in his own right with unique foibles and desires. The screenplay does a lot to demonstrate the particulars of representation lead to different tonalities. It manages to make a really obvious twist hidden in the process of doing that as well. The story is great.But it is also realized in some of the most vivid, alive animation I have ever seen. The film's CGI is expressive in ways that CGI rarely is. The directors lean into the stylistic implications of the story, each of the Spider-people have a different look for example. But they manage to make the film feel whole and unitary. Best of all the mainstay of the animation feels like the bright marvel style of the 60's mixed with the vibrant world of street art. (Miles does graffiti). Comic panels, lettering, action sound text etc all make appearances. It was a massive risk that pays off. The visual scope of this film is amazing; it is simply incredible how alive this film feels despite the stylistic artifice.This is a film that truly works in every regard.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","martimusross","4 April 2019","I so want to agree with everyone that this movie was amazing and fantastic and perhaps the best thing since the invention of sliced bread, but when you look closely there are significant problems.Let's start with what was good;1, the comprehensive construction of Miles as a personality, from his dialogue to his jokes from his singing to his clumsiness, this was realised in micro-gestures and facial expressions as was Miles' father and uncle, a brilliant piece of animation.2, the movie created a comprehensive atmosphere and style and was planned and executed to an inch of its life.3, you were gripped from the start, whilst watching the movie there was a great dramatic impetus, you were desperate for a conclusion.4, the music, graphics and minute detail was all brilliantly realised.What was not good;1, if you take out the character development, that must be secondary to the story, we have boy infected by spider, trying to stop the Kingpin from using a machine to bring back his dead family, this is hardly a substantial story.2, if, and I believe it is the case, that the story above was incidental and that the ""real"" story was ""everyone can wear the mask"" this is using or abusing the vehicle of Spider-Man to advance forward a political agenda.3, if we had a parallel dimension then Spider-Man would be the same in each dimension, just as New York was the same in each dimension, if we had a alternative dimension then nothing would be the same so there would perhaps not be a Spider-Man, this was jumbled thinking at its best, which is it?4, we had blatant gender and racial appropriation and a whole array of divisive stereotyping that was used to underpin a political agenda, it was perhaps even gross tokenism, let's say no more.It cannot be right to use a movie to promote ideologies of globalisation, political correctness and identity politics and embed this within the core of a movie and this needs to be called out for what it is, this is indoctrination and liberal authoritarianism bordering on brainwashing.I did enjoy the movie whilst I was watching it but afterwards I felt I had been cheated, preached at and manipulated to a political world view, that is the latest Hollywood fashion trend, that places identity above everything and we are all citizens of nowhere.","9/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","drael64","3 March 2019","The visuals, while extremely ADHD are beautiful and help mask the usual uncanny valley physics that plague CGI heavy movies. That said, what is actually happening in some scenes is pretty vague, generally it's too busy.The story telling is competent, when the writing isn't tripping over itself with overly concious lines, or progressive character tropes. At least unlike most such movies, the messaging doesn't entirely overtake the plot, and there is actual character development.And even with those progressive tropes, there is some messaging around courage, and tenacity, typical of heroic movies that are often absent in the more wish forfillment progressive typical story telling.Although for a hero origin movie, there is very little trace of self sacrifice, which is it's essential nature. Still, whilst it is somewhat hamfisted message fiction, they manage to wrap it into a plot that makes the film servicable and tucks the messaging into places where a less observant eye might miss it.In general, it's safe to say this is pitched at kids. Which makes me not the target audience. It's neither good, nor bad, whilst the comic book graphic style in itself is worthy of some praise.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","RforFilm","17 December 2018","We've got Peter Parker. We've got web-shooters. We've got a group of villains called ""The Sinister Six"". Yep, we've got a Spider-Man movie again. It used to be we would go several years between the further adventures of New York's web slinger. Now were going months. In fact, Spider-Man had a big part of the MCU epic Avengers: Infinity War back in May. So what's going on in December that requires an additional movie? You'd be surprised by how vast the comic world is that does justify another movie.Like how many people have played a particular superhero, many people have played Spider-Man aside from Peter Parker. One popular addition is of another New York kid named Miles Morales. He garnered phrased for being the first half African-American, half Puerto Rican character to play a superhero. He was also noted for taking Spider-Man back to a youthful demeanor as Peter Parker in the story was getting a little old. But it doesn't stop there. There's also Spider-Woman, Silk, Spider-Noir, and even an anthropomorphic pig called Spider-Ham who operates on cartoon logic. While we don't exactly get all of them, we do get a bunch of them, along with an origin story for Miles in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.Young teenager Miles Morales (played by Shameik Moore) is adjusting to a new life at a prestigious boarding school academy, at the insistence of his cop father Jefferson (played by Brian Tyree Henry) who wants a better life for his son. Miles wants to impress his parents, but finds comfort in his more free spirited uncle Aaron (played by Mahershala Ali). One night, while the two of them do some graffiti art in a hidden area of the subway, not only does Miles get bitten by a spider, but also witnesses a battle and death of the popular Peter Parker Spider-Man while spotting Kingpin (played by Live Schreiber) working on a large machine that takes affect.Like Peter Parker's story, Miles starts to notice changes like sticking to walls and spider senses. He visits Peter's grave to think about what to do next. Its here where an older Peter Parker (Played by Jake Johnson) meets him and asks for help to help him return to his own dimension. While uncovering plans from Kingpin to open several dimensions, Miles also comes across Spider-Gwen (Played by Haile Steinfeld), Spider-Noir (Played by Nicolas Cage), Peni Parker (played by Kimiko Glenn) and her robot, and Spider-Ham (played by John Mulaney) who all help figure everything out.As you can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse juggles a lot and almost makes the mistake of cramming too much for one movie. Amazingly, the script not only keeps every character listed above in check, but also makes it a great story for young Miles Morales. If your worried that this is another origin story, this is one that puts a lot of focus of Miles and his relationship with his father and uncle. I can't disclose why, but it really creates new pressure that Peter Parker never had to face.In terms of the rest of the characters, I really like this side to Peter Parker that we had yet to get from the other adaptations; a Spider MAN. A man whose gone through so much and had his heart broken several times, that he's more of a broken hero that needs fixing himself. His story balanced out well with Miles. He also gets a good scene involving the aunt May of this universe, almost like seeing a living ghost that was very sweet. While I don't want to give too much away, each Spider person gets their own arc as they navigate their way through Mile's world.Let's talk about the animation, which looks great. Rather then going for a Pixar/DreamWorks look, this Spider-Man story has a comic book-look that takes advantage of that fact, along with that it's also animated. Unlike a lot of live action movies where use of computers can occasionally be distracting if not done well, it all blends well, especially with the action sequences. The angles remind me of the comic pages I still turn, given the use of color and word bubbles, that never become annoying, and are used accordingly to amplify the drama and comedy. This is a movie with the rare distinction where it's all it's own.I'll give this ten Spider-Man comics out of ten. This was a fun and different Spider-Man movie that we needed, even more then Spider-Man: Homecoming. It could come off as too weird for some, but given the story's focus is still on this kid's growth as a hero and a teenager, it never felt overwhelming. It was an odd example of everything accidently fitting into piece. This is an absolute recommendation. Swing in and go see it.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","jakebirkel","19 December 2018","This had better win some Oscars.Okay, from the beginning: this movie is excellent. It is a thrill ride from start to finish, from being inventive to charting a new story to introducing so many good characters. Miles Morales' story is unique, emotional, and above all, fun.Performances: they're voice performances, so at first glance there isn't much to consider, but once you get further into the movie, you hear these actors truly commit to their characters. Shameik Moore's voice embodies Miles Morales perfectly, and Jake Johnson finally finds a character that's not a stoner; he does have fun with it. Haliee Steinfeld is exhilarating and perfect as Spider-Gwen. The rest of the cast... they're all fantastic, I just don't have time to talk about it right now. Go Spider-Ham!Direction/Writing: with three different directors, you'd expect this to come off as jumbled and incoherent, but it is not that at all. The scenes are well executed, the fight choreography is exhilarating, and the way they blend animation is simply stunning. The writing was soooooooo goooooooood. Phil Lord really had a story he wanted to tell, and he didn't skip out on any opportunity; somehow, we'll be laughing one minute and bawling the next. He really left it all on the field, especially with all ridiculous avenues he decided to go down with characters like Spider-Ham, Penny Parker, and Spider-Man Noire. The best part is it all works! The villain, Kingpin, is a bit sidelined, but it doesn't matter in the end because the story is about Miles and the people in his life. There's a moment in the trailer where Miles jumps off a building and we get this beautiful upside-down shot, and that moment is somehow even more satisfying given everything that leads up to it. The combo of story and characters truly does work.There's so many things I could talk about, from the immersive world to the killer soundtrack to the fact they use sound effects that correspond to the character's respective universes. You can feel the amount of time and effort that went into this movie, and you can feel that feeling of satisfaction that it paid off. It's a truly unique movie and inventive experience that is a sight to behold. (10/10)Seriously, Academy, look at this movie. And give it like all the awards.","9/10"

The constant visual fireworks feels like an ADHD nightmare.The overabundance of childish slapstick comedy gets old really fast.

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","ThomasDrufke","19 December 2018","We've gotten to the point in this golden-age of comic book movies where studios are starting to feel more comfortable taking storytelling risks. With Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Sony not only took a huge risk with the animation style, it's lead character, and bold story choices, but it's actually a very good film in its own right. Blending a heartfelt story, well-timed humor, and a bold animation style, Spider-Verse is the best Spider-Man film to date, and one that should garner all sorts of accolades. If it wasn't for an ending that gets bloated with hectic animation, it could flirt with some of my favorite animated movies of all time list. Either way, it's fun, infectious, and shows that the superhero genre has a long way to go before it runs out of unique ideas.8.9/10","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","grantss","7 October 2019","Miles Morales has just started at a new school and is struggling to fit in. Then he is bitten by a radioactive spider and he obtains certain powers, similar to those of Spiderman. He doesn't know what to do with the powers, or how to control them, so naturally he turns to Spider-Man for advice.Had some potential, initially, to be an original take on Spider-Man and comic book movies in general. The story doesn't follow Peter Parker, so is not the same Spider-Man story that's been told over and over before. Is animated, so original in terms of production (ironically, considering what comic book movies are based on...).However, despite these differences, it ends up being pretty much same old, same old: a linear, action-based story. Character development is token: everything is just a set up to get to the next action scene. Plot, what there is, is what you'd expect from a comic book movie: rambling, basic. Quite unengaging.Is fun at times, but certainly no more than your average comic-book movie.Hardly revolutionary, despite all the hype that says it is.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","MooWoolf1","23 February 2019","I had no great expectations at all. Let's start with that. I haven't seen a single picture of the movie, so I had no idea what I was going to watch.I've seen the great reviews of it, some stating that they were expecting something super overrated and it turned out to be the opposite.
So.Here I'm. Long story short, I accept the fact that the majority of the people who have seen this have low needs. That's why movies such as Roma for example generated only $3m at the box office. People in general need easy movies, don't have to think at all, more colours the better, some silly jokes and there you go.
That's why they don't make movies like the Fight Club today. Those kinda movies don't get the money to be made because people wouldn't watch them. Sick and might be hard to accept for some of you, but it's true. De Palma and many others states that people tasted Cola and now they only want to drink Cola.This movie was predictable. I didn't like the style of it, but it was ok. New, but not good. It had it's silly jokes, many nonsense things. TONS of PLOTHOLES.
Also it was easy. VERY EASY. If you have seen any Spider-Man movie, series or something, then you have already seen this movie. Literally.I was just waiting when comes that moment that will lift this movie up that would make it to deserve it's score. I was truly hopefully waiting until the ending. Every scene somehow just kept bringing more and more nonsense things into the way, not even caring about the rules of the movie itself. Then at the end we had a Clark Kent moment, when he puts his glasses on and nobody can recognize him and the movie ended.Visually wasn't good. Have seen far better visuals in an animated movie.
The best thing about the movie was the uncle's theme song. I liked that.Otherwise this movie is no different from the most of those that take place in the top250.Not even close to The Lion King, Your Name, Spirited Away, Grave of the Fireflies. Even Monster Inc. had more in it.It is currently no. 26 and with it the no1 animated movie. Which is funny because it had 1 Oscar nomination only. WALL-E had 6. Toy Story 3 was even nominated as best feature. Both of these movies and better by far.So, in my opinion this movie is just a great example of what people need today and how easy it is to impress them. It was far harder before.It is going to win it's award for the same reason. But it wouldn't even deserve to be nominated. Hollywood is full of people that don't know what a movie is or should be, they just take part of making one trash like this.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","oscaralbert","21 December 2018",". . . and especially because they each opened in American theaters on December 14, 2018, viewers have naturally wondered whether MORTAL ENGINES and SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE tell the same story. The quick answer to this question is a simple ""Yes."" Let's examine some of the areas of congruence . The makers of MORTAL ENGINES and SPIDER-VERSE strive mightily to make their characters more ""diverse"" than a United Nations picnic. This is quite ironic, because these flicks emanate from New Zealand and Japan, two of the LEAST diverse, most homogenous places on Earth, with immigration policies that make the USA's current White House Occupant seem like a spiritual brother to the Statue of Liberty by way of comparison. However, SPIDER-VERSE deserves a higher satisfaction rating than MORTAL ENGINES because it celebrates a hallowed past (even after ALL of its end credits have rolled), while the latter flick runs out of gas desperately seeking to set up sequels which will rival HEAVEN'S GATE II, HOWARD THE DUCK QUACKS AGAIN, and ANOTHER ISHTAR when it comes to audience demand.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","RuriGokou","9 April 2022","The word meandering sums up this movie very well. It just takes so long for the story to get anywhere. I'd say it takes about an hour into the movie for it to start moving. I kept reaching for my phone from time to time because I just couldn't focus. The humor is very hit or miss. There are some things inserted obviously for a younger audience. While some of the jokes did make me laugh, some also made me cringe or feel awkward.I liked the animation style but then again I'm a fan of anime. So I didn't have a problem with it.I couldn't like Miles very much. He was at least A LITTLE more likable in the PS4 video games. I don't understand why people are saying Peter was made out to be an idiot to prop up Miles in this movie. Miles acted like a weakling and a coward for a GOOD portion of the film. Despite the other universe Peter's circumstances, he at least was fighting. Besides, I think they made him that way to act like the fallen hero/mentor cliche.The female characters were more interesting than the male characters. Why don't they get there own movies? Gwen's story sounds a lot more interesting than Miles. And how she obviously was a ballet dancer and uses that in her fighting. It's interesting. But, I guess people of color trump a white woman?Overall, it's okay. But I don't see what all the fuss is about. Young kids will probably love this. But if you're always watching movies like me. You're not going to be impressed and just see all the flaws as you watch.","9/10"

I was looking forward to this movie for two reasons: a great voice cast and the whimsy of multiple Spider Man/characters from varying dimensions. But instead of building interesting characters (heroes and villians) I was presented with a number of long, chaotic action sequences robbed of dramatic (or comedic) tension by the lack of well articulated characters and interpersonal dynamics. There was also a production anomaly that was puzzling - there were times when the animation was blurry as if drawn for 3D (there was a 3D version, but that wasn't the one I was viewing), so, I hastily put on my 3D glasses, which I happened to have at hand, and it was still 2D, just blurry ... odd(?). I hoped for a better story and entertaining character interactions but I was disappointed. I give this film a 5 (meh) out of 10. {Marvel Animation}","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Phil_M_A_Kerr","19 December 2018","Using misaligned colour templates, like 3D without the glasses, for portions of the screen that were out of focus was a bold step. Bring them together and our eye is drawn to that now sharp part of the screen whilst everything else goes out of focus, or rather misaligned. What a different way to direct the audiences' eyes. Maybe a subliminal nod to the existence of parallel realities.
Like all good PG animations, the creators build a bit more depth into the narrative which makes the film a coming-of-age tale, leading the young viewers into the world beyond. Despair and faith, loss and hope, and all those adulty type themes are threaded through this three-dimensional ... no, MULTI-dimensional tale.
It is a silky-smooth incorporation of comic book panels, colours, and shading into a big screen motion picture.
The city slicker wit had me laughing out loud aplenty although it is occasionally too clever for this semi-rural simpleton.
This was a Tuesday night 9:30pm session with about a dozen adults and no kids so it was probably wasted somewhat without its target audience. Nevertheless, it is good to see the PG-rated teen animated epic is in capable hands.
When I was a lad we had epics like Watership Down, the Mouse Trap to enthrall is over the Festive period. I hope Into The Spiderverse delivers just as well to the current generation.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","BenWollmuth","19 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an ambitious film. Sony's last few attempts with the character of Spider-Man have been underwhelming to say the least. I haven't seen a good Sony owned Spider-Man movie since 2004's Spider-Man 2. Luckily, Spider-Man: Homecoming turned out to be a pretty good film, but that was mainly Disney and Marvel Studios, so I still had low expectations. However, I am happy to say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an awesome Spider-Man film, and an amazing film overall.
Instead of following Peter Parker like every other Spider-Man film out there, this film instead tells the story of Miles Morales and how he handles being Spider-Man. This is a bit different, however, because instead of skipping the learning and the suit making, we see his struggles firsthand. Miles makes a promise to his world's original Spider-Man that he would put a stop to Kingpin, but he has no idea how to control his powers, so he has a hard time.
Luckily, Kingpin's fancy collider machine happens to bring in some other Spider-Man, as well, so that Miles can get the help that he needs. The best part about this film is the way the characters are handled. The writers understand the character of Spider-Man, no matter what dimension he/she is from. They all have different personalities and art styles that make them stand out from each other. They did such a great job that I now want to see spin-off films for all of the Spider-Men in this movie.
Into the Spider-Verse is a lighthearted film, and is able to mix seriousness with comedy for the perfect effect. From the comedy aspect, the film, as I said before, understands Spider-Man. He is a funny character and knows how to stay calm in any situation. He cracks goofy jokes and says witty one-liners. With this movie, the different personalities of the different Spider-Men mixing together brings the comedy. On the other hand, the serious family issues bring some conflict to different characters, but in order to keep this spoiler free, I will not go in depth.
There is one issue I have with the film, but it isn't too big. Okay, the character is too big, but the issue is not. Kingpin, I feel, needed more characterization in order for me to think of him as a good villain. We learned some things about his family, but that was really it. He was a just a large man who wanted to conduct an evil plot. I can look past this, however, because the movie wasn't really focused on Kingpin. It was more focused on the Spider-Men, and most importantly, Miles Morales. Since this was done so well, I can forgive the film the Kingpin issue.
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a film that was much needed on Sony's part, because it shows that they still have good things they can do with the character. Animation, I feel, is the best format for Spider-Man, but that might be because I grew up watching the Spider-Man animated series. Overall, this is an awesome film, and definitely deserves a watch. If you are a Spider-Man fan, I believe you will truly adore this movie as much as I did. If you are a heavy critic who doesn't know much about the character of Spider-Man, I think you will enjoy this movie too. If you just like movies in general, go out and see this movie. It's worth it.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","kosmasp","25 November 2020","If you are going to go animated, why not just go all the way with it. And while Nicolas Cage will not ever become Superman (at least real action life in movies), why not give him something else to really dig himself in and just relish ... having fun with it and sharing that fun with us.The movie is quite self aware. From the whole origin story, to what happened before (even making fun of the Spidermans before - the ones Sony did, not the Marvel Cinematic Universe mind you). And it all works out fine, while being culturally appropriate and adding to the mythology. The dialog feels fresh, the story is cool and we get so many funny things thrown our way ... not just for fans of the previous movies or comics ... this really is great. And I say that as a big MCU fan myself, but it makes me happy that Sony will continue to do their own thing too! Especially if they stay as creative as this! There can be more than one! This movie is all the evidence you need for that ...","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","EderR28","14 December 2018","This is a straight up animated masterpiece. The animation style, the universe(s), the voice acting, the story telling, everything is amazing. I feel bad for the other animated films this year, because Into the Spider-Verse blows them all out of the water. It's hard to believe this is the same animation studio that made the smash hit The Emoji Movie. Spider-Man: Homecoming is still my favorite from the hero, but this one is not far behind. My only, tiny complaint is that the villains weren't very fleshed out, but with the multiple Spider men and women needing adequate backgrounds and screen time, I can easily look past it. This is a superhero movie for the typical fans or the oblivious viewer, creating the always beautiful message that anyone can wear the mask. We're all a lit bit Spider-Man.","5/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","shawneofthedead","13 December 2018","THE LOW-DOWN: Does the world really need another Spider-Man movie? In just over 15 years, we've already had three different Peter Parkers, each one with the same basic origin story. It's a reliable formula that's been run into the ground... hasn't it? And yet, Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse will have you clamouring for more. This fresh, funny, fantastic film proves that there's entire universes of mileage left in all things Spider-Man - introducing us to brand-new hero Miles Morales, while also dissecting (and reinforcing) our love for good ol' Peter Parker.THE STORY: Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is a high-school kid just trying to figure out his purpose in life - which sharpens somewhat terrifyingly into focus when he's bitten by a radioactive spider and finds himself literally climbing the walls. Suddenly, he's forced to assume the mantle of Spider-Man, battling to save the world from the heartbroken insanity of Wilson Fisk (Liev Schreiber). It's a tall order for a half African-American, half Puerto-Rican kid from Brooklyn but, fortunately, Miles soon discovers that he isn't alone in the universe...THE GOOD: Where to even begin? Into The Spider Verse is a delight in practically every way. First and foremost, it's remarkably refreshing to see a character like Miles - a young man of mixed-race descent - get his own superhero origin story. It helps enormously that the screenplay, credited to Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman, is equal parts sweet, sharp and snarky. Some superhero movies (*cough*DC*cough*) can take themselves too seriously, but Into The Spider Verse skewers Spider-Man's cinematic history with a cheeky charm that's impossible to resist. Miles also leads a cast of enormously appealing characters, including clever twists on fan favourites like Peter Parker (Jake Johnson), Aunt May (Lily Tomlin), Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and Doctor Octopus (REDACTED).THE NOT-SO-GOOD: There's almost too much going on, all the time. Into The Spider Verse is stuffed to the brim with multiple characters, multiple universes and multiple plot-lines - so much so that the emotional weight of Miles' fraught relationships with his dad (Brian Tyree Henry) and uncle (Mahershala Ali), which should tear audiences apart, comes close to getting lost amongst the shift and shuffle of the plot. It's hardly a deal-breaker, though: the narrative beats are all there, ready to be savoured and rediscovered on a rewatch.THE GLORIOUSLY GEEKY: Comic-book fans, rejoice - this one's for you. There's a soul-deep love for Spider-Man lore threaded through every gorgeous frame of this movie. Naturally, it's right there in the plot, as alternate universes collide and truly cult characters tumble into Miles' life. But it's the medium of animation that makes the real difference here. It's why Into The Spider Verse can embrace its comic-book roots in a way that live-action movies can't. In some of the film's most visually arresting sequences, Miles leaps and soars in and out of frame, trailing sound effects and narration in his wake. This living, breathing comic-book effect is the crowning achievement of Sony's animation arm - not only is it fluid and stunning, it's ridiculously inventive, mixing and matching animation styles to further plot and develop character.WATCH OUT FOR: Easter eggs galore! Spider-Man and Marvel aficonados should keep their eyes peeled for references peppered throughout the film. The late Stan Lee's cameo will break and warm your heart in equal measure. Meanwhile, Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli, who co-created Miles Morales, are name-checked, as are concepts and terms well-known to fans of the comics (Earth-616 and all). Stay through the credits for a series of of wonderful, silly rewards, including a song off Spider-Man's novelty Christmas album and some intriguing scenes that hint at where this new animated franchise might go. (A sequel and spin-offs have already been greenlit! üôå) ALSO, this film features possibly the best use of Nicolas Cage in a movie since National Treasure!*RECOMMENDED? YES. Into The Spider Verse isn't just the best Spider-Man movie that nobody asked for - it's one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made, period. It's also a top contender for best animated film of the year.*Okay, fine, having Cage voice Superman in this year's Teen Titans Go! To The Movies was genius too - a nod to his life-long goal to play Superman. Maybe Cage should stick to voiceover work... ü§î","4/10"

Especially adding on to the fact that all the acting is fantastic, the dialogue is wonderful and rich, the characters are awesome and funny, and the story is fantastic and fresh.

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","piggulu","16 December 2018","Overall, I found the whole thing underwhelming. While the animation and comic book style is excellent, the movie suffers from a monumental case of identity. Excluding the parallel universe concept, it initially presents itself as grounded/realistic. Average kid just wanting to be a kid, etc. But then it heaps on unspectacular one-liners/physical gags reminiscent of old cartoons (Kingpin's design and Peter Porker) I felt like I was watching a Dreamworks animation film, and although I easily classify myself as ""young at heart"" and am always a fan of classic Looney Toons(Tunes?) I didn't find much particularly funny here. Which leads to the question: who is the main audience, young/older adults or primarily kids? It doesn't really play strength to either. Is the movie an ensemble film? Not really, Miles is so much the main focus that the rest of the could've been left out entirely or just appeared at the end and it probably would've made a tighter film. None of them get to personally shine or have a memorable moment. One can argue that's part of the charm of ""Anyone can wear the mask"" but I disagree.Honestly, if it wasn't for the eye strain from the 3D then I most likely would've fell asleep.","2/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","WisdomsHammer","2 July 2019","Ok, first of all, if you are ages 8-11 and like super hero movies I think this maybe might be your thing. Maybe. I think it's aimed at more like 15 year olds but they forgot and made most of it a silly cartoon. Oh well.Overall, I did like this. I had fun and thought it was entertaining. But it's not a 10. It's a 7 probably. There are too many things that don't work for me.Probably my biggest beef in this thing is that our hero goes from zero to hero in ONE SCENE.Not exaggerating, he goes from a kid so dumb that he plays in traffic, refuses to tie his shoe, can't walk down a hallway without bumping into people, and just stands there with his mouth open most of the time (this happens so often in the first three quarters of the movie that it's repetitive - they really want to pound it into us just how dumb Miles is) to a courageous superhero in complete control of his faculties and sophisticated superpowers - IN ONE SCENE.Come on! Where's the training montage? They tease a training montage in several wasted scenes and never give us one. Training montages have worked since kung fu movies and Rocky! Are we not doing those anymore? I think that's a mistake. But whatever.And when exactly was his ""with great power comes great responsibility"" moment for making mature choices?Where the hell did that spider come from? Why did it take so long to bite him? Why did it crawl over his entire body (without him feeling it) and then decide to bite his hand in particular when it could have bitten him anywhere? To give a two hour movie 5 minutes of padding?What audience is this aimed at? We've got some great mature themes, coming of age themes, and we've got Spider-Pig. I guess they just decided to scattergun this thing and try to hit everyone. It's surprising that it works at all. Pixar does wide audiences well. This thing has individual scenes aimed at different audiences and it feels disjointed to me.What worked for me:
The animation. Incredible.The voice acting. Loved the performances. Disney does this very well.Half the writing: Peter B. Parker's story in particular, Miles' relationship with his father and his uncle, Spider-Gwen (would have liked to have seen more of her and I bet we will).All the easter eggs, from the comic books to the stupid theme song to the Gwen Stacy moment to the dumb finger pointing meme after the end credits and more.The overall plot and storylineWhat didn't work for me:
Half the writing: How dumb they made Miles through the first three quarters of the movie, and putting him in complete control of his powers in a single scene in particular. Pace it out a little more!Spider-Man NoirSpider-HamAunt May is apparently Spider-Man's version of Batman's Alfred now? NO.Most of the silly slapstick cartoon humorThe character design and seemingly indestructable qualities of KingpinIndividual storylines that seemed to be aimed at different audience demographicsThere's more I suppose, but this is a good enough run down. There are a lot of reviews out here so I'm doubting many will read this. I'm kind of writing this for myself to remember what I thought of this thing if I ever watch it again.7/10 for me but I'm rating it 6 because there are WAY too many 10s here.","10/10"

Considering the Sony movie that came before it was The Emoji Movie, most people were skeptical, but leaving that theatre, I have no doubt in my mind people were blown away! The idea of a multiverse is sick, but it's even sicker when it is executed like it was in Into the Spider Verse, it is often considered the best Spider Man movie of all time, even by Raimi trilogy fans (such as myself) and it definitely deserves that title. It balances seriousness and comedy without falling down, and that ""What's up Danger?"" scene is magnificent and one of the best scenes in cinema history!All the people from different Spider-verses are likeable and hilarious, every scene could be made into a poster because of how aesthetically pleasing the entire movie is.

But they did do that Modern Marvel Comics thing and turn him into an idiot screw-up in an effort to alienate the fans and somehow make Miles better by mocking Peter.And I'm not a fan of that. Parker is a dork, he's got a smart mouth...but he's really smart, a genius, totally heroic, and well, the call him ""The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man"" for a reason. He cares, specifically he cares about the average working schulb.This kind of just took Peter Parker and almost mocked him and, honestly, I can't get behind that. i couldn't get behind it when they turned him into a bully in the Garfield movies, and I don't care for it when they mock him here.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","derk144","14 December 2018","The best animated film of the year. It just goes to show you that you can have a superhero film with 6+ heroes, 6+ villains, with plenty of fan-service & cameos that still is easy to follow while telling a compelling story. Comic fans can enjoy the amount of details included for them, while general audiences still understand who the good guys vs the bad guys are without a huge backstory for each character. The different Spider-People (Persons of Spider?) could all carry their own films, showing off drastically different art styles & a great voice cast. The animation is some of the most uniquely stunning visuals I've seen on screen, looking like comic book pop-art brought to life with newsprint texture, dialogue bubbles, & fluid motion. The writing is tight with plenty of heart & tons of laughs. It's a coming of age tale about a teenager who doesn't necessarily want to be a hero but feels that he's the only one who can in his realities time of need.

The last thing to say: I belive the film is overvalued. Yes, it is beautiful, new generation, so to say, BUT, I can't agree that this film has the right to stay in line with one of the best films in the World.

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","lahejarishabh","15 December 2018","There have been so many spiderman films, each of which was cut off from a sequel and rebooted over and over. However, this could alone stand out to be a much better spiderman film in comparison to them all. Into the spiderverse takes you on a sci-fi adventure of multiverse, a spiderman film we have all been waiting for.The animation alone stands out to be the best feature about this film. This new style of comic book animation is top notch and a must watch especially for comic book lovers. The efforts taken in creating and rendering this film was worth it. The film is innundated with so much of high quality design, byzantine animation, one can't take their eyes off the screen and even afford to miss a scene.Even though it has a small run time to it, as most animated films do, this film offers a good character development and good storyline which is unpredictable at times making you shout out ""wow"" especially if you are a spiderman geek.There is an adequate amount of humor. The humor is not forced at all, it has good one liners that makes you enjoy the film from the very beginning. Into the spiderverse is a fun, fresh take on the spiderman story filled with excellent quality content, brilliant animation, lots of humor and exciting action sequences.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Gordon-11","24 December 2018","This animation is full of energy and is very fast paced. I really like the colourful palette, and the fact that it really mixes things up. The animation combines 3D animation, Japanese anime elements and backgrounds that would probably have been 3D if viewed through 3D glasses. Combined with the split screens and texts on the screen, it really looks like a comic brought to life.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","TheHoodOfSwords","16 June 2020","So like... going into this film I was incredibly optimistic and excited. Because the last time I saw this I gave it a 9/10 and the only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 was because I thought Miles got too good too fast. Then I realized, all the Spider-Mans have that happen. This one though actually focussed on the teaching part which I really enjoyed. Miles isn't a god at web-slinging immediately, he grows and has to overcome his arc. It's his origin story, and surprisingly even with a gigantic cast of characters, 4 villains and 6 Spider-people the movie still feels like Miles's story and he never feels shifted to the side for anything.One thing that I think this movie absolutely nails is the fluidity of Spider-Man. They move with such elegance and grace (Most of the time at least) In a way that animation can really bring out and show. Ever flip and roll all feel incredibly fluid and it moves from one scene to the next with such grace. A lot of the time during movies I do what I like to call the three pauses. 1 at 20 minutes, which is usually me deciding if I want to actually watch the movie, one an hour in to see how much is left and then one more at an hour and a half because I feel that length elapsing. In this movie I didn't pause once (With the exception of a sync error) I had to pee so incredibly bad for the last 20 minutes but I was so captivated by the colours and story I didn't want to.The villain and soundtrack in this movie were good, I say villain but this is one of these movies where, not to sound corny but you can say that the main villain is just growing and evolving as a person. Struggling to find your place in the world. The pop hip hop soundtrack didn't blow me away but I don't think that's the intention. It elevates what Miles is feeling a lot of the time and it never overstays its welcome.Yeah man... the colours in this film are brilliant. It's like if you took Thor Ragnarok and multiplied it by a thousand billion million trillion. For a movie set in New York which I can say from experience does not have a lot of colours this movie really makes you feel immersed in a kaleidoscope of colourful mess. But not mess in a bad way, mess in a way that's so comforting.This movie also made me cry, it's the second to ever do that. Just wanted to mention that.If a superhero movie is like a grilled cheese sandwich this is like if you threw that sandwich out the window, made a 20-course meal using every atom from that grilled cheese in a way that nobody has ever thought of before. For a movie that feels so much like a comic book superhero movie, it's somehow so incredibly refreshing and brilliant. Can't wait for the sequel and can't wait to see my crush Gwen in the next movie. Please for the love of god watch this movie. WATCH THIS!!!","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","dragon3611","2 February 2019","Looking at the first 3 million reviews on here you would be forgiven for thinking that this film is the best film that has ever, and will be made - well it isn't and I suspect that political standings have had something to do with this. The film is ok but visuals and metal soundtrack not to my taste.
One other thing that spoils things in a massive way..... why is Spider-Man, Superman, Hulk etc special??? ..that's right, because there is only 1 of them.
As a true Spider-Man fan, I wish the creators of this movie would disappear back into the dimensions from which they came.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","elicopperman","16 December 2018","If there's one notable superhero with a very hit or miss track record when it comes to their film adaptations, it has to be Marvel's iconic Spider-Man. Whether they be the right blend of goofiness and emotional drama with Sam Raimi's trilogy, or the embarrassingly lackluster Amazing Spider-Man series, the web slinging hero has been through as many duds as successes. However, there has never really been an animated feature with this hero or any incarnations....until now. Ever since the first trailer dropped last year, the buzz for this particular film blew up, mainly due to it focusing on a new Spider-Man, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales. After finally seeing it, I can officially confirm that the wait was beyond worth it.The main storyline revolves around Miles Morales becoming the next Spiderman after getting bitten by a radioactive spider. However, the evil Kingpin creates a portal to other universes that goes haywire and ends up pulling distinct versions of Spider-Man into Miles' world. Upon meeting Peter Parker, Miles now has to take Kingpin down and bring those incarnations back. With all that said, the film rests on Miles' shoulders to lead, and he is one hell of a protagonist. Alongside being very likable, the film does a great job of establishing his relationships, personality and even emotions. I also like how he only grows accustomed to his powers after many trials and tribulations with all the craziness going around. Even his interactions with Peter Parker feel like that of an apprentice learning from a master, they're so much fun to watch.In addition, the film happens to be a great blend of self referential humor and emotional drama. Screenwriters Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman cram in plenty of in-jokes for hardcore Spider-Man fans in a subtle manner without losing newcomers, making them feel connected within the narrative. As for the emotional weight, it stems from Miles' different bonds between his father and uncle Aaron, and both are well woven into the plot. There are even scenes with the two around Miles that one would never expect from a film like this. For a film with several villains, they all have just enough screen time to be memorable, especially Kingpin, mainly because his reasons behind making the portal are more elaborate than first assumed. Never has a superhero film managed to squeeze in the right amount of humor and pathos to work well as a part comedy and part drama since The Incredibles and The Lego Batman Movie.As for the other characters, Peter Parker is established as the pessimistic hero turned failure, yet his relation with Miles gains him more confidence to get back into the swing of things (no pun intended). Throughout the film, we really feel for the guy and want him to succeed as much as Miles, making him come off as a sympathetic albeit charismatic mentor. Gwen Stacy is also appropriately placed within the film's narrative, as rather than being a Mary Sue, she plays as a voice of reason to Miles and hopes the best for him, like a real partner should do. As for the multiple dimensions featured, there's the 1930s serious dramatic Spider-Noir, the goofy and comical Spider-Ham, and the bubbly anime girl Peni Parker. While not given as much attention as Miles and Peter, they still end up stealing the show with their distinct quirks and charm, and their voice actors, especially Nic Cage, bring them to life as much as the script and animators do. It's rare when a film is able to squeeze in so many characters yet still manages to give them enough presence to leave an impact.Lastly, the animation is incredibly versatile, vivid, colorful and even grim, really emulating the feel of a graphic comic book. The characters are all uniquely designed based on their appearance and personality, especially the Spider-Man incarnations looking distinct based on their physical appearance. Spider-Noir is black & white with shadows all around, Spider-Ham is very cartoony and bouncy, and Peni Parker is every anime girl ever made cranked up to 11. Not to mention, the action scenes are fantastically well directed, as the stakes really rise up with a lot of well choreographed fighting moves and a briskly paced flow. It's also worth praising how the film conveys its emotions through the color scheme depending on the scene, saying way more than any amount of dialogue ever could. My only issue with the animation is that it can look a little blurry at times, but that's more of a nitpick as it's intentionally built that way.Overall, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has got to be my absolute favorite addition in the Spiderman film franchise. It also might be the most imaginative and innovative comic book film on screen in years thanks to its wonderful stylistic choices, humorous antics, well woven drama, and characters you will never forget. If you are yet to see this, please give this film as much support as you can, it's definitely a blast to sit through. We rarely get superhero films like this nowadays, so giving it the attention it deserves will mean more sequels and huge cult status for years to come. Sony Pictures Animation has only scratched the surface with what Miles Morales can do, so here's to more great adventures with the new up and coming Spider-Man in the future.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","13 December 2018","***(Spoilers Ahead)***Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is so much better than anyone expected it to be: it's the kind of film people don't realize they want so badly, and when it comes, it's a breath of fresh creative air. This film's the best kind of crazy: alternate dimensions, cartoony-drama (family issues and dying mentors) mixed with humour (cartoon pigs, film-noir cliches and Japanese mechas), culturally remixing Spider-Man into a living and breathing idea; anyone can be him, and what makes them different defines their own Spider-Man.Spider-Man is still one of my all-time favourite characters: he's tied with Batman and Superman as far as I'm concerned, and it was high time that Spider-Man got his own theatrically released animated feature. Spider-Verse honours the character and then some with its wholly unique animation style, its star-studded voice-actors and the whole thing feeling like the sort of thing Stan Lee would have wanted to see on the big screen. Stan unfortunately passed away before the film's release, so hopefully he got to see an early screener copy of the film. Who knows? It sucks that he's gone now; but his creations (his brain children) live on through the endless stream that is modern pop-culture. This movie's definitely a zeitgeist piece for Spider-Man: a self-aware love-letter to a character whom both comic and non-comic fans know and love openly.This film delves into the origin story of Miles Morales: and how he became Spider-Man after Peter Parker is killed by Wilson Fisk (The Kingpin). We see Miles' dilemma of being himself play throughout the movie, and when the Spider-Men from the multiverse come into his reality, they help overcome his deep-inhibitions. This movie doesn't gloss over the dramatic stuff easily (Kingpin's family die in a car-crash) and it somehow manages to balance out the humour with the serious stuff ridiculously well (Spider-Ham and Spider-Gwen compliment the comedy-drama duality of the film). Spider-Verse is the comic book movie people have wanted since Frank Miller's Sin City: it's got that same to-the-T comic-book styling to it; and I don't say that lightly at all. It's something amazing to behold on the big screen.If only animated cinema in general could acknowledge that it's okay to be as aesthetically liberal with animation as people can (and do) go with live-action cinema through endless variations of stories, genres, styles and motifs. I think movies like Spider-Verse show that Disney's animated fairy-tales (while still being very enjoyable) don't represent what animation CAN be like Japanese animation does, but films like Into The Spider-Verse represent what animation inevitably WILL be: a varied landscape as diversified as any medium in life can possibly get. The 2010s have been a rather progressive time for American animation and I'm more than happy to see Hollywood tackle things outside the 'Disney fairy-tale comfort zone'.I loved every second of this movie and I'm stoked for the sequels and spin-offs! This movie was a SUPER-BLAST!P.S. Stan Lee, Steve Ditko: you both made the world a happier place to be thanks to your genius creation.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","namashi_1","27 December 2018","Spider-Man movies have been really good. The ones helmed by Sam Raimi were particularly impressive, as those films focused on the idea of the boy beneath the mask, Peter Parker. The ""Amazing Spider-Man"" movies seemed lazy and hence 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse', being an animation tale, seems to be a risk.But let me tell you, 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is nothing less than Blockbuster Entertainment! Yes, this is the Ideal Christmas film, that is high on action, emotion and comedy. And of course...soul! I don't remember having so much fun at a Superhero film since Black Panther!'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' Synopsis: Miles Morales becomes the Spider-Man of his reality and crosses paths with his counterparts from other dimensions to stop a threat to all reality.'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a joyride from the word go. Miles is an interesting protagonist with his own demons and powers that he comes to realize, but this film brims in Magic and brings in too many Spidey's from other dimensions to offer us a blockbuster in its truest sense. I won't give away much spoilers, but this is a film, that deserves to be viewed with your entire family. Its got the bite!Phil Lord & Rodney Rothman's Screenplay is superb all through. Running high on energy while also focusing on soul and substance, this Animation film never runs out of breath. While the action is simply amazing, the emotional connect among its primary characters is what really stands out. Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman's Direction is excellent, as the animation gets enough scope to leave your eyes fun-filled. A special mention for Daniel Pemberton's Score and Robert Fisher Jr.'s Editing.The Vocal Performances are top-notch all across the board. Shameik Moore as Miles Morales / Spider-Man hits all the right notes, giving us a hero who must explore his own voice. Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker / Spider-Man is absolutely fantastic. Nicolas Cage as Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir does a remarkable job and seems to be having a ball. Kathryn Hahn as Olivia ""Liv"" Octavius / Doctor Octopus and Liev Schreiber as Wilson Fisk / The Kingpin, voice the menaces to perfection.On the whole, 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a winner all the way. It's a blockbuster that has heart and soul. What else could you ask for?","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","southdavid","18 December 2018","Glorious. There simply is no other word for ""Into The Spider-verse"" a fun, thrilling, funny, self-referential trip through the history of Spider-man, in both film and comics. It's one of the best films I've seen this year and one of the best animated films I've ever seen.The Kingpin (Leiv Schreiber) is conducting dangerous experiments under the streets of Brooklyn, opening wormholes to alternate dimensions. Aside from bringing through a radioactive spider, which bites young Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), the wormhole also drags through various versions of Spiderman from across the multiverse, who must team up to put an end to the Kingpins plans and save the multiverse.The animation style of ""Spiderverse"" is top notch. A beautiful blend of 3D computer animation and 2D elements. Occasionally aspects are ripped directly from the pages of the comics too, with sound effects written on screen or occasionally splitting the image in to panels. It's a unique and dynamic experience. That would be for naught though if the script and story wasn't up to much, so fortunately the film excels here too. The story finds a legitimate excuse to drag the various Spidys together and actually gives them something to do. It's funny too, self-referential to the universe, to the medium and to the film itself. The highlight of the humour is probably ""Spiderman Noir"" a 1930's detective version of the web slinger, whose whole world is monochromatic and is voiced with laconic style by Nicolas Cage.It does have some darker moments though, a couple of deaths that would be a bit much for some of the younger children in the audience. Stan Lee's cameo too, though nothing specific about the cameo is sad, it still pretty emotional for his first one since he passed (if you ignore ""Ralph Breaks The Internet""). Also, at least in the screening I saw, occasionally the image seemed to .... Duplicate somewhat ... as if you were watching a 3D film without glasses on.But those minor detractions won't take away from a magnificent film that I'd really like to see more of.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","jon.h.ochiai","24 December 2018","""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is astounding stylized state-of-art animation with the look and feel of 3-D Japanese Anime. The animation is visually shadowed and soulful with vibrant pastels. Not just mesmerizing eye-candy, team of Directors - Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman craft a fresh rites of passage narrative of immerging Spider-Man, half-African American Miles Morales, voiced by spirited and smart Shameik Moore. Although in Phil Lord (""The Lego Movie"" and ""22 Jump Street"") and Rodney Rothman's screenplay, Miles is one of several 'Spider-Men' and 'Spider-Women' intersecting in this Marvel superhero, sci-fi, family mashup.Turns out that villain ""Kingpin"", voiced by malevolent Live Schreiber, the blockish hulking bald cartoon figure used his invention - the Super Collider to collapse the multiverse. To what ends? Honestly, I don't think even Phil and Rodney know. That might be beside the point. Because, ""Into the Spider-Verse"" is just raucous fun with a warped sense of humor and a big heart.Directors Bob, Peter and Rodney introduce the Spider-Man in New York that we all know and love: Peter Parker, voiced by whimsical Chris Pine. He's the guy, who was bitten by the radioactive spider that gave him his amazing strength, agility and 'spidey sense' as in sixth sense. After an extended Superhero career of 22 years including his failed marriage to the love of his life Mary Jane, voice by Zoe Kravitz, Spider-Man dies as a Hero, doing what he loves to do: Saving others.Miles is a teen attending a college prep school on scholarship: The brilliant computer geek, who chills to Post Malone. His Dad Jefferson Davis, voiced by stalwart funny Brian Tyree Henry, is a police officer, who not a big fan of Spider-Man and his ""along with great power comes great responsibility"" dogma. Somewhat self-absorbed, he unconditionally loves Miles. Jefferson even coerces Miles to say, ""I love you, Dad."" - in front of his entire school.At school Miles is sweet on pretty smart blonde Gwen Stacy, voiced by wonderfully aloof Hailee Steinfeld. Their attraction is mutual. Miles derives security in his relationship with his Uncle Aaron, voiced with street gravitas by Mahershala Ali. Aaron and his brother Jefferson Davis are estranged, given Aaron questionable shady dealings. Yet, Aaron is the cool Uncle, who encourages Miles's distinct gift as the street tagger of amazing urban spray paint murals. While working one of his masterpieces, Miles is bitten by what looks like a radioactive spider. Consequently, Miles acquires his Spider-Man powers.At the same time Miles meets his alter-dimensional persona in older paunchy Peter B. Parker, voiced by funny, mildly cynical Jake Johnson, who teaches Miles the ropes of Spider-Man's web-slinging. While escaping from Kingpin's facility and swinging through the snowy forests, Peter and Miles encounter sleek white suited Spider-Gwen - Gwen Stacy (Hailee). Turns out too, that Gwen is the Spider-Woman from yet another dimension. Like Peter, she also needs to return to her home dimension.So it's up to Miles, who must wrestle control of Kingpin's Super Collider, to forge the dimensional pathway back to their respective dimensions. Meanwhile, Miles meets Spider-Men from other dimensions. Black and white Spider-Man Noir, voiced by off-the-wall Nicolas Cage, is from a past dimensional era. There's Warner Brothers-like cartoon Spider-Ham, voiced by hysterical John Mulaney. Life-size Japanese Anime Peni Parker, voiced by quirky Kimiko Glenn, is from the 31st Century sporting her advanced robotic Spider-Man. As Peter says, ""This could literally not get weirder."" Balancing this phase-glitched universe are versions of Spider-Man's villains: Green Goblin, Scorpion, and a few others that I don't recognize.There is a whole lot of nonsense running amok in ""Into the Spider-Verse"", yet the directors resonate in asking, ""What makes a Hero?"" With surprising poignancy, cartoon Spider-Ham tells emerging Hero Miles, ""You can't save everyone."" Otherwise, the great responsibility and power become a curse.When Miles has doubts that he can become the Hero, Peter tells him, ""Take a leap of faith."" Believe in the hero that's within all of us. Our Heroes arise from our belief from within, and from the love those who believe in us. For Miles that's the world-weary and wise Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, and brave and compassionate Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen. Radiant Shameik Moore makes us believe that his Miles shall discover his own greater than self within.""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is about summoning the Hero within all of us. Even more so than the amazing animation, that narrative makes ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" one of my favorite movies this year.","6/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","AdrenalinDragon","6 December 2018","Man I'm shocked to like this movie as much as I did. I never would have guessed it would have been one of my favourites of 2018. I expected the usual standard Superhero CGI Animated movie, but looking at the credits now and noticing people behind The Lego Movie wrote and produced it, it all started to make sense.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse could very well be the best Spider-Man movie ever! The animation was very stylish with mix of CGI and Comic-Book style art. This is a movie that did not take itself seriously at all, and with many different universes of Spider-Men it just went crazy and gave us a real packed 2 hours of entertainment. The use of music was decent, there was alot of heart to it, surprises, good gags, and it all felt fresh and interesting to the series.Overall, a real standout for Sony Pictures Animation and a very high bar set for Animated Superhero movies, giving other Animated movies a run for their money.8.5/10","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Horst_In_Translation","1 July 2019","""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is an American animated movie from 2018, so still relatively new and fresh and actually this was the dominating film at awards ceremonies last year from the genre. It won the BAFTA, Golden Globe and eventually Oscar as well, not to mention managing a rare clean sweep for all its nominated categories at the Annie Awards. I will spare you the names of the many writers and directors here, as you can check them out for yourself, but the voice cast sure was spectacular. Lead actor Moore is not too famous and Johnson (who voices Peter Parker) is probably also only known to New Girl fans, but Steinfeld, Ali, Tomlin, maybe Pine and of course Nicholas Cage (Kick-Ass anybody?) should really be known to non-film buffs too. Maybe a few others as well. I mean there wasn't a voice performance that really stood out, but they were all rock-solid. Maybe American viewers will recognize them better. In terms of their voices. Or won't because they did such a great job.Let me say initially that I watched the version that runs for under 2 hours slightly and not the one that gets closer to the 2.5-hour mark. Still a fairly long movie for the animation genre. But it never feels that long, it rolls really smoothly thanks to a good story at its core, constant comedic delight and distraction, memorable characters as well as great attention to detail. There are only minor criticisms I have here. One would be that the father-son story struggled for a long time to really become as significant as they wanted it to be, even if right from the beginning there are solid comedic moments like when he takes him to school and says something like ""I love you"" in front of everybody and towards the end, it is also nice as well. Another, maybe my biggest, was that really how he developed his strengths and talents felt way too sudden. There should be a slow path to his craft where we see him struggle and fail with using his webs, his invisibility, his electric shocks etc. but it was fairly rushed. Oh yeah, and I was a bit confused Gwen Stacy was also the alternate universe Spider Man really. Or the part about his dad hating Spider-Man.So much for the negative, now for the positive: This film was looots of fun all in all. Many highly enjoyable sequences and those that did not do too much for me, like the big battle scene vs. Kingpin towards the end were at least visually on a truly high level. You can also see that the film does not take itself too seriously although it had the right to do so. Kingpin's looks are the best example. And then the 4(?) alternate universe Spider Mans. I mean the anime girl was so much fun and it was actually pretty sad when she lost her vehicle near the end and also to see how they were bonding with her and understood her pain. Film noir Spidey (Cage) was a lot of fun with his Rubik's Cube. Spider Woman was good too, even if the female character that impressed me more was Olivia Octavius, maybe also because of how surprising it was they went for a female version of her. In general, the film used many interesting references from the franchise, Green Goblin has a brief presence, Doc Ock is in it for longer. The losing one's uncle part is of course a memorable parallel and still I did not see it coming. I wonder who Spidey Pig lost. By the way, if you thought Spider Pig was already amazing in the Simpsons movie, then you will be amazed by this one here. Oh God he even is a cannibal as we see on one occasion, but he has really many fun moments.The film's wit and courage can be seen so many times. The best example is probably that Peter Parker dies early on in here and somewhat ironically, this is the moment when he really enters the movie (from another dimension) and is seen constantly on screen to be somewhat of a teacher, but more than that, actually more of a friend in fact to the one who is about to take PP's place in this new dimension. This crucial story point of Miles being bitten around the same time when Parker dies was one of the best things about the film. There again it is not a special moment or so, he just pushes the spider away as if it was nothing. Funnily enough this is when it all started when he was hanging around with his uncle, later on his enemy, but still beloved. The one thing missing here was perhaps Jonah Jameson or maybe he was also in it so brief that I missed him. I think not though.I already mentioned the great attention to detail. This applies to the moments when the film moves forward story-wise, but also these small moments, be it a hommage to Stan Lee that most Avengers movies can only dream of quality-wise, the most funny pig comment with the actual pig standing right next to them or just really minor things like talk about ""great expectations"" literature-wise vs. no expectations. No idea why I remembered this so closely. I think usually these films stand and fall with the main antagonist, but this is really more about becoming a hero and defeating the bad guy on the way. Kingpin is okay, but he never truly steals the show. Also interesting his own background story why he wants to open the portal to another dimension not knowing that even if he can get his wife and son back this way, they are still doomed, so everything is lost in any case for him. Now looking at the animation, it was good overall in terms of characters, pretty spectacular in terms of special effects on many occasions and to me it did look a bit like a video game in the calmer more restrained moments. By the way, most random snippet of information, there is also an actress names Morales in here. You could also think that there is more of a focus on ethnicity with the protagonist being a mix of Black and Hispanic, but there really isn't and I certainly liked that. No need to shove any forced messages into our face here and make a cringeworthy try-hard impact to fit in with the current political climate.Instead, the film elaborates on friendship and togetherness more than anything else and another great idea behind it all is that this film does not take place in the dimension where Peter Parker is key. Or at least not after he dies. It does not take place in the dimension where we live in, even if it feels this way sometimes. Now overall, a really good film and almost a must-see for animation lovers. It is definitely better than the very overrated Incredibles sequel from last year that did a lot wrong that this film here did right. I still think it is maybe not as outstanding as you could think from all the awards recognition it received and also if you take a look at the rating here on imdb. Sure, during its best moments it is better than 3 stars out of 5, but all in all, that sounds pretty accurate to me as the really big emotions they sometimes tried to go for weren't really evoked when it comes to my subjective perception. Also not by any definition the best animated movie of all time, which it was here on imdb for a while. It is pretty revolutionary with the idea of different dimensions and the execution, but Top10 is the limit I'd say. And it's not my favorite Spider-Man movie either. That would still be Maguire's first vs. Dafoe. Perhaps it is approximately on par with the sequel there. All, in all a positive recommendation with no hesitation, just don't expect true greatness.","9/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","kingsgrl2010","17 December 2018","This is one of the most ambitious movies ever created and it's one of the best animated films ever made.This movie is so vibrant, it feels like you are flipping through a comic book + the pages just leap right off. Everything in this was brilliant from the script, the colors, the casting, music and overall feel. I really love the inclusion of so many different ""spider-people"" you have Miles Morales, Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and even Spider-Ham. It just made the movie even that more fun.You don't need to watch any Spider-Man movies prior to seeing this, but if you have (or read the comics) it is loaded with cameo's and easter eggs. While this movie can look flashy and have a whole lot pumped into it, this is simply Miles' story, his journey, and a joy to watch.... Stan Lee also has the perfect send-off cameo (that I may have shed a tear at).oh, and also stay to the end of the credits for this one.

It has one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. It's just this good. It has great character, a simple but very compelling and interesting story and it's just a really good time. Miles was great. I loved his insecurities. It's a weird thing to say but the character feels very relatable and real. You feel his struggles and the pressure that he has to face in his life, with his parents, him releasing that his uncle is working for KingPin, living up to Peter Parker and Gwen and all the other spider people's expectations. You real feel for him. As for Peter Parker, I didn't like that they killed off Peter Parker from this universe at the start of the movie and then another version of Peter just comes up immediately after that. It kinda ruins the death and sadness a little. I would have liked it more if they had a couple more scene or maybe a one day jump before introducing the new spider man. But that's just me. After the Peter J. Parker, was introduced everything just kicked in from there. The whole sequence with Peter and Miles breaking in and out of that lab was wonderfully entertaining and Gwen's entrance couldn't be better. The other spider people introduced later were less useful aside from looking cool and having some memorable moments.Have I talked about the animation yet? it's freaking amazing and watching this actually inspired me to work on some of my art projects that I have been putting off. From the details of the sky scrapers to the reflections and the whole climatic battle scene at the end is just beautifully done and just really really good and satisfying to look at.Overall, the plot, the characters, the animation and the Stan Lee (oh, yes that was good too. Rest in peace Stan Lee, the line he delivered was also really funny and emotional as well) were just spectacular and amazing (see what I did there) and I definitely recommend this movie, even if you're not a Spiderman fan, watch it please. We need a sequel to for this movie. My hope on Sony has been restored.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Animated_Antic","18 December 2018","Spider-Man has gone through a lot in film, hasn't he? From the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi with Tobey Maguire, to Marc Webb's two Amazing Spider-Man films with Andrew Garfield, and being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Tom Holland. He has really been through a lot. So if you took him as well as many different incarnations of the comic book character and put them into one movie, you'd get ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"". It may seem like a really crazy idea, but here it works. And it works phenomenally well. This is such an amazing animated movie and is also a breakthrough for new animation technologies. I haven't really seen a full length animated movie like this until now and it really is mind-blowing. This seriously is such an amazing movie.Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is a teenager living in Brooklyn who is having a complicated life. He has been accepted into a new school despite not really wanting to go and is having a sort of difficult relationship with his parents (Luna Lauren Velez and Brian Tyree Henry). He does though bond closely to his uncle Aaron (Mahershala Ali) over his passion for graffiti. One night though, Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and then starts to develop very strange powers. It doesn't stop there though. After seeing that Kingpin (Leiv Schreiber) has built a Super Collider in hopes to reconnect with his now deceased family, he then suddenly realizes that the portal has opened up other Spider-Men into his universe including Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Man Noir (Nicholas Cage), Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), and even an actual Spider Pig named Spider-Ham (John Mulaney). Together they must stop the Kingpin's plans of possibly destroying the world with his Super Collider and to get the other Spider-Men home before they glitch and eventually die. I would say more that happens, but I'd rather not spoil because you just need to see the film for yourself.Last year, I remember Sony Pictures Animation making their worst film to date with ""The Emoji Movie"". That film was boring, unoriginal, unfunny, painful to sit through, and clearly a product of corporate executive meddling. A year later, they have made their best film to date as it was captivating, funny, and a really thrill ride. For an animated comeback, this really is one of the best I've seen in years. It's clear the company is heading forward as a filmmaker driven studio which allows for more creator influences and ideas and less executive interferences and I'm very happy to see that. The story's main focus being on Miles getting the hang of his powers as well as the responsibility of taking on the role as Spider-Man is the highlight of the film. Seeing him growing as a character and getting through difficulties including struggling at this new school, trying to bond with his parents, and learning from the other Spider-Men characters is what makes the movie fantastic. It's what I expected to see from a superhero movie and I think it really delivered. As for the animation, it's incredible. This is probably the closest movie I've seen that looks like a comic book and it blends traditional animation and computer animation together really well. I've seen the technique dabbled with by Disney in shorts like ""Paperman"" and ""Feast"", but never have I seen a full length feature animated movie take on this style until now. Having seen it though, I can easily say I want more. This really is a game changer. The characters in this movie were the real highlight though. Although the character growth of Miles is the highlight of the movie, the other Spider-Men characters are all hilarious and stand out. Peter B. Parker and Spider-Woman are great teachers in a way to help Miles becoming who he is and Spider-Man Noir and Spider-Ham led to some of the funniest moments in the entire movie. I'm so glad they weren't in the trailers and I dare not say them here because they're so funny. This really was a fantastic animated movie, but I can say it's not flawless. For one, the dubstep like soundtrack did grate on me a bit and kind of got on my nerves. I prefer a full orchestra over dubstep any day. Also, I thought Kingpin could've been just a little bit better as a villain. I understood his motives and thought Schreiber did a fantastic job playing him, but I don't think he was quite as intimating and evil as I wanted him to be. He did come across as threatening, but he could've been just a tad bit more for me to legitimately fear. Still though, that's really it.""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is seriously a phenomenal animated movie with a great superhero story, fantastic and groundbreaking animation, and funny memorable characters to really hold it up. This really is such an achievement for Sony Pictures Animation and I'm so happy to see that they can really make a fantastic animated movie. I hope to see some more awesome movies like this in the future because this really did blow my mind.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","cinemawithcj","6 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse makes you aware pretty early on you're in for something special. The curious project long in development unsure of where it sits in Spider-Man canon makes it known that it is the Spider-Man canon.It's a love letter to every single piece of Spider-Man you know and love and even the stuff you might not. The movies, the cartoons, the comics, the character, the icon. If you want a definitive Spider-Man, I think you're looking at it.Into The Spider-Verse oozes so much style from it you can't help but be sucked into its universe. The animation is slick and gorgeous and perfectly on form here, translating Spider-Man to the big screen like you've never seen before. It's beautiful and it's technically impressive, playing with all sorts of styles (helped by the diverse supporting characters) but never losing sight of its spirit.There's never been a more true comic adaptation. Watchmen is so far back in the mind alongside every other comic book movie here, Spider-Verse uses so many techniques in it you just feel everything you expect Spider-Man to actually be. It's like if Deadpool had those yellow boxes, or if Fantastic Four had a good movie.You feel so much love for Spider-Man in the making of this film, full of everything for the hardcore fan to the most casual movie-goer. Whatever your working knowledge of Spider-Man, you're going to be impressed.The actual story and characters haven't even been touched in this review so far and that's because Into The Spider-Verse gets the groundwork just so right of course everything falls into place. It subverts expectations, it gives you the exact payoffs you want, it has such smart humour and touching emotion. It's everything great about every Spider-Man piece of fiction and almost none of the flaws.Into The Spider-Verse surpasses even the likes of Spider-Man 2 here. It's not hammy (beyond Spider-Ham), it's not cheesy, it's not full of bad CG, it's not got soap-Opera antics that don't land, it's not set outside New York, it's none of those things.Spider-Man is reinvented alongside all the references of his reinvention. It gives us an origin story that doesn't suck, because it knows you know all of that. Several times over. It knows how smart the audience is. It knows we know the stories. The beats. So instead it gives us a show. It gives everything slightly different to what you know and expect, but leaves you happy with how familiar things are.The entire cast and crew have truly made something special. The writing, the directing, the animating, the acting, the soundtrack, everything. It shows the work that has gone into it. It stands apart from most of the other animated movies of recent years. It makes yet another good case for animation needing more of that mainstream blockbuster highlight. This is better than pretty much most of the superhero movies that have been made to date.Life has been breathed into Spider-Man yet again. And it's not necessarily gone bigger and better. It's human. It's funny. It's down to earth. It takes us on the journey Miles Morales is being taken on. Things get weird. Things get fun. An all star voice cast's praises can't be sung more. None of the people involved can't be celebrated more.There's great power given when you get the reins of Spider-Man. And with it comes great responsibility. Or however the saying goes. I'm just glad that I'm in the Spider-Verse were it all goes perfectly with this movie.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","jg_1977","17 December 2018","Wow. That's the only word that I was able to articulate after being blown away by Spider-Verse. Normally I write my reviews as soon after seeing the movie as possible, however this time, I needed to give myself a few days to make sure I wasn't just riding the high that the movie leaves you on, and that it actually was as well-made as I thought. A few days later and my thoughts haven't changed. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not only the best animated movie of the year, it's also the best superhero movie of the year (and this is coming from someone who loved both Black Panther and Infinity War), and simply one of the best movies of the year period (not to mention the best Spider Man movie of all time). This film succeeds in every conceivable way: it's got well-written, compelling characters that are brought to life by superlative acting; the visuals are stunning and create the most immersive theater experience of the year; the action is thrilling and never gets repetitive; the story manages to be both completely groundbreaking while also paying homage to the Spider Man story we know and love; and best of all, the comedy is absolutely spot on, every single joke lands without feeling cheap or getting old. As good as this movie is across the board, I suspect it all stemmed from an impressively written screenplay. Not surprisingly, Phil Lord (and an uncredited Chris Miller), truly understands what people enjoy and relate to in the Spider Man story and brings that to the screen beautifully. What's accessible about the character of Spider Man is that he (or she) is just a normal kid who gets these extraordinary powers and learns to become a superhero. As great a character as Iron Man is, it's pretty hard for a child to relate to the hard-drinking billionaire who happens to fight crime. Spider Man is relatable because he is a superhero every person can see themselves becoming in those circumstances. And that is the thesis of this film. Anyone can be Spider Man. The introduction of the Spider-Verse actually serves this message and enhances the story, which is what made the movie so enjoyable. At no point did the multi-verse concept feel like a device for selling toys (ahem... Porgs), but instead was a natural way to set up Miles Morales. There are only two things I could think of that could get criticized in Spider-Verse, the first is its inaccessibility to people who don't like Spider Man or superheroes, and the second is its visual style might not work for everyone. To address the first issue, I suspect there will be people who think this movie is only entertaining for people who already enjoy Spider Man properties, but I strongly disagree. Taking the Spider Man aspect out of this film, there's still a lot of great storytelling at work. Within this movie is a coming of age story about a black-hispanic kid trying to fit into his almost all-white high school, a story about a father trying to relate to his son, a story about a man who has given up on life who needs someone younger and more hopeful to show him the way, and a damn good science fiction story about a multi-verse. All of these narratives work without the superhero aspect, and I think make this film completely accessible to someone who has never seen a Spider Man movie before. The second issue about the visual style I understand a bit more, as initially the visuals didn't work for me. The style is shaky and imperfect and I felt like I was watching a 3-D movie without glasses. However, I realized they meant for the look to be imperfect and rough around the edges, just like worn out comic book come to life. I think part of the problem is that in recent years, with Pixar and Illumination movies, animation has gotten so refined and smooth, that is was at first off putting to see something break out of that mold. But after about 30 minutes, my eyes adjusted and I was able to get absorbed into the world they created. In summary, Spider-Verse is a mesmerizing movie that is firing on all cylinders and absolutely succeeds. It's funny, smart, heartfelt, with a message that makes me feel as hopeful and optimistic as I did when I was a kid seeing Toby Maguire become Spider Man for the first time. If you love Spider Man, you will 100% eat this movie up, and if you don't already love the wall-crawling hero, you will by the end of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Go see this movie!","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","paul-allaer","24 December 2018","""Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018 release; 117 min.) is the latest version of the Peter Parker /Spiderman story. After a clever opening montage with the Columbia/Sony/Marvel logos, Spiderman introduces himself to the audience: ""There is only one Spiderman, and I'm it!"". We then get to know Miles Morales, a teenager who admires Spiderman, and does not like attending school at the elite Brooklyn Visions Academy. His dad is a cop at the NYPD, and does not care much for Spiderman. One day Miles visits his freewheeling uncle, and while Miles is working on mural art, he is bitten by a spider. He wakes up the next day having grown taller overnight, and with a lower voice, and with strange powers. Could there be more than one Spiderman? At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when a movie requires not one, not two, but three directors, it typically is a very bad sign, but in this case it turns out to be the exact opposite. Among the never-ending stream of comic book heroes live action fare, often with dubious quality (this week's Aquaman looks particularly bad), here comes a computer-animated film that has been freed from live-action shackles, and as a result is the freshest offering in the comic book superhero movies in a long time. The animation is dazzling, the characters are in-depth, the story line is complex and engaging. When I saw the movie's end credits, I saw all these big names for the voices (Nicolas Cage, Hailee Steinfeld, Lily Tomlin, Zoe Kravitz, Liev Schreiber, etc.). Truth be told, I hadn't recognized a single of them as the movie was playing. Look out for a cameo appearance from Stan Lee himself (sadly he passed away just weeks before this movie came out). Bottom line: ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider=Verse"" shows the way how, for me, comic books should get the big screen treatment. Can't wait for the sequel and apparent spin-offs (yes, plural!).""Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse"" was released wide on December 14, with tremendous positive buzz and critical acclaim. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely, with lots of families and kids ""from age 7 to 77"". If you are curious whether the film is as good as people say it is, I readily suggest you check it out, be it in theaters (for maximum visual impact), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","10/10"

The best thing I can say about this movie is that I had a smile on my face from start to finish.

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Eclectic-Boogaloo","12 February 2020","I wasn't able to make it through the first hour of this movie. First of all - it's a beautiful looking film, one of the best looking animated films I've ever seen. And I also liked most of Lord & Miller's quips. It's pretty funny.My first problem was that the movie's opening 45 minutes were a cringey diversity checklist (and this is coming from a minority). At least make the introduction of all the characters organic for god's sake. Spider Gwen's intro was one of the most obvious in the history of comic book movies.Another even larger problem was that the constant interjection of jokes and quips undermined every single bit of drama that there was to be had. I like jokes just as much as the next person but once in a while just let the drama build. Is that too hard? There doesn't have to be a joke every single minute. This was like a Marvel movie on steroids in the absolute worst way. Very disappointing.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","donaldricco","2 September 2019","Lots of positives in this - attention to detail, the six (well, 5 for me) alternate Spideys, and the quality of the animation! Loved Spider-Gwen and Spider-Ham! And I really liked how Spider-Man Noir looked! Super cool! (plus, it was amazing that Nicolas Cage didn't ruin it! I guess NOT seeing him makes him betterish!) I liked the name Peni Parker, but I don't like anime at all, so I could have done without her completely.
Negatives - fight scenes were boringly too long! WAAAAAY too long! And everything having to do with the machine thing was boring, lame, stupid, confusing, etc. Yes, it got all those Spideys ""here"", but it was a terrible plot point. And the fight at the end with the machine? It's length and pointlessness almost made me shut off the disc. Seriously, how long was it? 20 minutes? So, so bad.But if/when I re-watch this, I'll fast-forward those scenes, and probably have a 4, 4 1/2 star watch! And a much more compact movie!","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Artylo","28 August 2019","To preface this review, one ought to know that review will not be from the perspective of an avid superhero aficionado but rather from a viewpoint of one with little to no exposure when it comes to the Spider-Man comic books, graphic novels or anything besides the Sam Raimi film trilogy and the 1994 animated series for that matter. As such, there won't really be any discussion as to the quality of adaptation when it comes to characters and how they relate to existing plot lines as compared to those of the film; however, to compensate, that would contribute to a more objective viewing of the picture on its own merits. Also of note, the film was viewed in 2D through the digital home release and not the 3D version in theatres.Of course, there is no denying that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of the most aesthetically impressive animated features of quite some time. Everything from the models, to the lighting, to the shading is made with immense artistry and lends itself nicely to the diegesis of what an animated comic book would look like if one were to exist inside it. While the animation itself has its flaws in terms in terms of consistency, there was a noticeable and considerable effort put into the use of shaders in effects such as chromatic aberration, the simulation of halftone patterns in the flares of lighting and hatching instead of flat colour shading; while the animation makes use of some classical techniques, such as squashing and stretching movement, shifting between 3D and 2D through rotoscoping, and motion smearing. One could point to the visual fidelity of the film as its strongest asset - and it most definitely is; however, one could easily gloss over some of the inconsistencies, owing themselves to the bewildering amount of framerates at play in some of the scenes. The production company behind the animation process cites a variation from 24 to 14 frames per second, which some have attributed as a stylistic choice to represent a form of character development throughout the plot as movement becomes less bold and more fluid along the hero's journey. However, on first viewing, the initial minutes of the film's runtime were quite the eyesore, requiring some adjustment before being able to completely immerse oneself in the experience. Human vision still processes images individually at around the 10 to 12 mark and even if these 14 frames of animation are done ""on twos"", it feels like a slideshow most of the time. What especially makes this jarring is that two characters can be animated using two different framerates in the same scene, which would usually be a massive red flag.One other contentious aspect of the film is its music. The influence of the east coast hip-hop culture is written into the DNA of the protagonist and the film's setting, and the soundtrack reflects that by making liberal use of licensed music, featuring heavy breakbeats with an electronic flair. Daniel Pemberton's score is a more classical offering, mixing orchestral and synthesized sounds to elevate moments of humor or tragedy, but taking influence from 70's funk, as well as more eastern or ragtime infused bits from different styles of animation. The main failing of the soundtrack is the use of the aforementioned licensed tracks, as they usually play over dialogue. These tracks, coming from a style of music which values quick and high tempo vocals doesn't match with the slower more narrative pace of the underlying dialogue and ends up overpowering it, making the dialogue hard to hear. The instrumental score makes great use of leitmotifs and gives every character their own theme with about 2-3 variations, which usually get played with good timing in moments of distress, surprise or in the many comedic points throughout the film, and it usually made more of an impression than the licensed tracks that just seemingly bound the main character to a stereotype more than anything.The main weak point of the film is perhaps its plot development. To be brief, the film has too many characters to sufficiently develop any of them into anything more than a single archetype with slight variations. Even in the script (now available publicly), once can notice the emphasis on allusions to pop culture tropes and internet memes as a nod to veteran fans of the series, rather than an attempt to establish something more meaningful. In its defense, it does make strides on being free of the now clich√©d origin story of Spider-Man, however it also makes a point to repeat it three more times than usual, rendering the whole effort of being brief and self-aware pointless, as it would have taken up about the same runtime as just going through with it in its entirety in the first place.The events of the film take place in two days in their entirety, including massive character-defining shifts in confidence, ability and skill as well as long term relationships forming over a mere few hours. In the end this makes any growth from any character appear as if they embody a Marry Sue/Larry Stu archetype, who develops whatever the plot requires to progress almost instantly. Tragedies take place, which feel like obvious tear-jerker moments for characters we've merely known for a whole 10 minutes, seemingly requiring at least some familiarity of the source material or a long term devotion to the series as a fan to grasp the severity of their plight. Alongside that, characters appear in and out of places at the plot's convenience, ruining any idea of continuity, especially near the end. Even so, the relationships between the characters only have an effect in the aftermath of the main conflict, uninfluenced by everything that has happened, as if these paradigm shifts in their personal lives were going to happen regardless of their presence in the events of the film. No one ever really grows in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; the closest thing being an equivalent to a B-plot of a parent drifting away from their child, which ultimately gets played for laughs.The screenplay follows The Hero's journey to the last letter, only differing in the many references it makes to other properties of the Spider-Man franchise, which show up sporadically throughout the events of the film. Even the idea of the ""Mentor"" is present, but effectively thrown out of the window, since the trials and failures, the growth of new skills and the death and rebirth of the main protagonist happen in one single scene, skipping an entire essential quarter of the journey.Everything in the plot moves with such haste that it has no time to go anywhere. By the halfway point of the film's runtime it is still tying up the loose ends of its inciting incident. As said before, it has too many characters that get introduced too quickly and in bulk. Drama is experienced and is immediately forgotten, since there is no time to dwell upon it. Motives are not questioned and are washed away.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a shining display of the skills of the talented artists and animators who worked on it, but they are used on a film with little to no direction, except for repeating the same clich√©s it aims to subvert in a franchise that is already becoming oversaturated by its own offerings in an attempt to reinvent itself for a modern audience, relying purely on fan-service and relatable pop culture references. It boasts a colourful cast of characters which it spends little to no time developing due to the haste with which the plot moves in an incredibly small timeframe of events. Ultimately, an experience that is pleasing to the eye with its skillful execution, but vapid in substance due to poor screenwriting choices. Nothing more than another origin story.","9/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","legonerdy","24 December 2018","I have to admit that I only went to see this movie because I'm a good big brother. That said, I was proved WRONG. The art style was incredible, but I could tell that from the trailers. What had me wondering was the batsh** crazy plot conflict.
I will readily admit that comic books are often a bit sillier than most forms of entertainment, but Into the Spider-Verse actually managed to sell it. The comedy was genuine, the soundtrack was amazing, the character designs were on point, and the whole thing came together in an amazing way.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Russoguru","9 December 2019","The first time I saw Into the Spiderverse... no kidding, I walked out. I freaking hated it. I didn't care for Miles Morales and his stupid uninteresting family dynamic BS between him and his felonious uncle, I didn't care for the ugly, choppy looking animation, nor did I like the stupid, overly cartoony ridiculously goofy tone. I don't care that this movie has all the spidermen in it, by the time all these other guys start showing up... it's too little... WAY too late.I watched it again recently and sigh... I still hated it. Seriously, I freaking despised this movie. Why people love this movie is beyond me... and yet... it won the OSCAR for best animated feature!!!! Slow year for animated films maybe?Well, maybe, or MAYBE I'm just missing something. I just find absolutely nothing of redeeming value whatsoever in Into the Spiderverse. You've got to also bear in mind I LOVE the MCU Spiderman. I think Spiderman Homecoming and Spiderman Far From Home are really good movies. It's just very difficult for me to take this movie seriously when it's so overwhelmingly goofy. I think that's my problem.And yet... kids and adults alike SOMEHOW like this movie! So maybe I am missing something, and maybe I should concede that this just isn't a movie for me. I didn't like it at all, but hey I guess chances are you and your kids will.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","hobgoblinlol","2 May 2019","Didn't really care for the film when it was first announced mostly because of the odd looking animation and the character Miles Morales, who I'm not a fan of, in this case screamed ""Look! black Spider-Man gets his own movie now!"" all over. But after the overwhelming praise this film got, it's every detail from animation to story-telling receiving colossal praise, I had to see it.With all the hype, I thought I was gonna watch a masterpiece that would blow me away and boy, was I wrong. The only thing I enjoyed about this film were some dialogues from classic Spider-Man and noir, Miles felt extremely generic, another story of how someone who isn't talented or capable at first BUT gets better because he ""believes in himself."" of course. The villains in this are just so bad. We have one villain for a simple emotional twist, throw away villains like the FEMALE Doc Ock, Tombstone and Scorpion. And Kingpin another attempt with the overused ""sympathetic villain"" trope who's design is absolutely horrendous, it literally looks like his head is attached to his chest, they could have at least given him his classic white suit which they of course didn't. The plot is extremely generic and predictable, it has some decent moments but overall nothing memorable. Don't get me started on the god awful soundtrack.My main problem with this film is the PC, SJW, diversity angle. It's just extremely conspicuous how there's such a HUGE amount of colored people even at a prestigious school that according to liberals are filled with the white privileged elite, it's just so ironic at this point. Even the villains. Either my standards are too high or everyone else's have lowered drastically. I love being proven wrong, I had low expectations when seeing Logan and John Wick 2 and I ended up loving those films. Either this movie is for a certain demographic of specific age or I'm one of the few insane people that think it's extremely overrated. Spider-Man 3 was at least entertaining, this is above everything is just boring.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","setsedrakyan","14 December 2018","Being one of the greater animated pieces created so far Sony managed to give fans everything they would ever expect to see in a spider-man story.

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","MJL_Uncensored","18 December 2018","Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is Sony's latest attempt to cash in on their license to Marvel's Spider-man franchise (like Venom), is one of the best non-MCU affiliated endeavors Sony has ever produced. While Venom was a refreshing update to the character's origin story, after the disastrous outing in Spider-man 3, it still lacked the presence of his most crucial adversary-Spider-man. With the infectiously fun Tom Holland's take on the web crawler side-lined till 2019, Sony needed to keep their only superhero franchise in the public sphere. However, this time, they took the bold step of animating the Spider-man franchise with a story centered around his multiverse doppelganger-Miles Morales.For those who are unfamiliar with Miles, he's an Afro-Latino character introduced in the comics world in 2011 as Marvel experimented with shedding their homogenous base and reached out to attract readers of all cultures. In Spiderman-Homecoming, he's briefly mentioned by Donald Glover's modest take on The Prowler. He even appears in Sony's newest PS4 Spider-man game, so the ground was tilled in advance of his arrival. Moreover, his appearance is nothing short of spectacular.Miles is a charming teenager with loving parents who are willing to send him away to ensure he receives a world-class education and the best chance at success in a dangerous world. He is the by-product of Gen-X age parents who were reared the same way. When he discovers his powers after the all-to-familiar radioactive spider bite, he has a chance encounter with the real Spider-man and soon has his entire world torn apart (literally) when an experiment by King Pin sucks multiple versions of Spider-man, into Miles reality. These multiverse Spider-people include two female versions of the acclaimed hero, two additional male versions, and a Looney Toons inspired pig version. It sounds like a recipe for disaster narratively. Surprisingly, the story works amazingly well. Moreover, that's not the only thing that works well in this film.
Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse blends the beauty of 3-D animation with the stylized look of ink to paper art. The union creates a fascinating phantasmagoria of lucid animation that will leave you in awe of its quality for the first half of the movie. When you're done being mesmerized by that, there's still room on your plate for a heartfelt story about friendship, discovering one's purpose and the love of family - all the things you've come to expect from this franchise. There's enough heart in this movie to make you care about the stakes in this film-which are felt early on and repeated later in the movie to remind you that this isn't a rated-G film.Now, it would be irresponsible to ignore Stan Lee's overriding message that the diversity of the Spiderverse (or Marvel in general) is a good thing in an era of diversity resistance. Miles parrots this, and so do all the other versions of Spider-man. Moreover, it's true. There's enough room in this world for multiple versions of this superhuman and we should all welcome updated take on the character when they're done this well.This film is a dazzling display of style and story. The tongue in cheek narration finds a way to celebrate the ups and downs of the Toby McGuire & Andrew Garfield Spiderman eras. Also, it's as much of a nod to the past as it is a celebration of the future of this franchise. Now, if Sony can find a way to make its villains as intense as they were in this movie-in their live-action films-they will be able to milk the franchise for all it's worth.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","ariqakbar","18 December 2018","Everyone was talking about the animation and I don't really have enough knowledge about that. But here's the things i can tell you about.Great visual even though I kinda got a little bit dizzy sometimes because the color and the speed of this movie but for me who doesn't know much about animation technical stuff, i still can tell this movie was dope.I love the story. The culture that this movie bring, the little twist that they give, the emotion. It's been a while since we got a movie like this with strong story. The music was good. It's genius, this movie have a lot of little details that make it great.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","thebricks","19 December 2018","Saw this today thanks to AMC's A-List. It was truly awful. I fell asleep and when I woke up, Miles formed some sort of Spiderman team with some Japanese girl in a suit, Spiderman Noir(?), Spider Pig, who I actually remembered from the nineties and some other characters. This was just absolutely weird. This movie was just all over the place, I don't think Marvel could possibly have had anything to do with this mess unlike Spiderman Homecoming. I'm at a loss as to why Sony has problems making a decent Spiderman/Venom movie. Yes, I know Venom did well, but let's be honest, people only went because Homecoming was so good, so they thought Venom would be as well. They didn't know Marvel wasn't allowed to have any say on that film though, sadly.Thanks for wasting 2 hours of my time. Don't waste yours.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","elgsdyr","22 March 2019","The strong point of this animated movie is definitely its fairly creative visual style but other than that it had nothing we haven't seen quite a few times before. Of course, within the usual strict narrative style in most Marvel stories, this one breaks the boundaries a bit of typical Marvel canon, but in the broader sense it's nothing original. Still, decent entertainment.","9/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","joexrayguy","16 December 2018","Absolutely spot on. Respects the history of the characters and story, but has a totally new fresh look. Visually amazing, its hard to absorb EVERYTHING that is going on on screen. I did have to go,out and make sure I wasnt in the 3D theater; some of the background items have a double outline that gave the impression of a 3D projection. I found out this was a production choice and I was in the right place. I think the way to tell a perfect melding of voice acting and production is when you look at the character onscreen and think ""Wow, they're really giving a great performance"" then realize, it's a cartoon, not a person in n the screen. You've been drawn in...they did their jobs well. Nice tributes to Ditko and Lee can be seen.","9/10"

This is a movie that's special as it is.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Pjtaylor-96-138044","16 December 2018","Just because 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)' is animated doesn't mean it's a 'kids' film. Here, the danger is always real, with the stakes never being anything less than (on-screen) death, and the experience is all the more exciting for it. Don't get me wrong, it's not overly grim; if you, or your children, have seen any of the web-head's previous films, you're probably good to go. This one is essentially everything you could want from a 'Spider-Man' story, an accessible yet comic-conscious blast from beginning to end. It really is an incredibly entertaining time, a joy of a movie that pretty much just gets better and better as it goes along. It manages to expertly mask its more conventional (though, as yet untold) 'origin story' elements behind its bolder and more unique 'multi-verse' motifs. You usually don't know what it's doing until it has just done it, even if what it has just done is the most by-the-numbers superhero plot-point you could possibly imagine, which makes for a refreshing, constantly original and highly enjoyable thrill-ride that's easily up there with the best of its genre. On top of all that, its phenomenal animation is literally groundbreaking, a unique blend of 3D and 2D that expertly evokes a 'comic-book' look. Because of this, as well as its quick pace, it's potentially the most lively and energetic film I've ever seen. It's amazing. Plus, it has one of the, if not the, best post-credits scenes of recent memory, one that not only bookends the piece with a relatively subtle yet still intriguing tease for the possible future of the franchise but also with the feature's best joke. It's a fantastic, genuinely funny note on which to end. 9/10","9/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","athanasiosze","2 December 2023","This is so much better than i expected. I am 45 years old, probably too old for animation movies, however i saw those astonishing reviews and i thought, why not, let's give it a try. During the first 30 minutes it was like another reviewer mentioned, ""just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman"", i didn't love it but it was not bad so i kept watching. To my surprise, this was getting better and better. Suddenly, i was hooked. And the last 30 minutes were amazing, i had goosebumps, i felt like i was feeling when i was younger watching movies like MATRIX, almost same excitement.I can't rate it higher because i didn't love the first half. First half was crucial though, in order for the events of the second half to happen. Sorry for my bad English, i mean this was a well structured movie and everything is happening for a reason here.I watched immediately after the ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE. Yes, this is a trioumph.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Animany94","19 December 2018","I admit it, I was a little sceptical about this movie knowing the history and reputation of Sony Animation and after I watched their live-action departent butcher the character of Venom in theaters earlier this year.But this was a stunning expirience! The company that gave us garbage like The Emoji Movie actually cared this time and stepped up their game.First of all, the animation was fantastic with lots of vibrant colours and an overall comic book feel to it unfolding when Miles Morales is discovering his new identity as his dimension's Spider-Man. Your eyes will be glued to the screen when this riot of animation gets going.We also get a well paced coming-of-age story of Miles Morales which is filled with lots of real-life struggles which makes him so relatable just like Spider-Man is supposed to be. I was so happy seeing a portrayal of him which understood his comic book character. The writers definitely knew about certain misinterpretations in the past.Even though not every character has a ton of development put into them, they still manage to make them work to serve the story. They get to tell a brief origin story just to make clear to non-Spider-Man viewers who we're dealing with. And the Spider-Man team is just so loveable and make great dynamics off of each other while they still keep both feet on the ground knowing how serious the situation is.And wait for the climax which is super intense and showcases animation's full potential in creating art and entertainment.A good coming-of-age story with amazing animation and intense action scenes that will blow your mind!","9/10"

The traditional 2D animation mixed in with computer animation and cell shading technique is something that you have possibly never seen before.
The story is easy to follow because they explain it as the movie goes along, so you do NOT have to know about the comic books or much about this particular version of Spider-man.
Do yourself a favor and try to see this on a big screen such as IMAX. I saw it in 3-D and I can say it does add to the experience.
This movie is definitely in the running for not just best animated movie, but best movie of the year.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","brianmlucas","16 December 2018","This is one of those rare instances where all the creators, the directors, writers, animators, actors, musicians, everyone, are able to put together a film that is both a homage to the rich history of a long established franchise without being subservient to it and also takes it into mind blowing, eye popping, emotion wrenching new directions. The final act alone is worth the price of admission and again one of those very rare instances where 3D is not a gimmick but actually enhances the pleasure of the experience and has meaning to the film.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Tivanboven","22 December 2018","In the midst of all the raving reviews, I almost feel like a fraud giving this film such a high score. However, for me personally, this does what it needs to do and more. Let it be known that I used to watch the Spider-Man cartoon in the 90s nearly every day so yes, I am influenced by nostalgia.Animation
I don't think that a lot of people can deny that this is the most interesting, dynamic and artistic animation which stays true to the original medium yet. When I first saw the comic book text and thought bubbles in the trailer, it kind of put me off a little bit, but it wasn't used throughout the film, only to depict Miles' newly developed awareness. I can see how the neon colours can induce headaches for some, but to me it was perfect. Maybe take an aspirin before going in if you're probe to headaches!Story
There are so many things to love! Granted, I'm not a comic book reader (contemplating to get into that thanks to this though) so all of the stories were fresh to me. I loved that (big spoilers ahead!) Miles' universe's Peter Parker actually dies in the first act. This gives great motivation to an otherwise uninterested Miles, shows the need for a vigilante, stars Miles' dad's character arc, shows the danger that Kingpin poses, allows for aunt May to show her strong side (nice change of pace from the classic worried old lady) among others. Even Kingpin's motivation can be sympathised with. I agree that the other henchmen, who are normally fully fledged bad guys, could get some more backstory though. However, for veterans of the series, the fanservice is gold. (Did anyone else get excited when doctor Olivia revealed her last name?)All in all I'd say that this is a masterpiece. But does it still the hunger for any other rendition of Spider-Man? No, so -1 point there.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","eparazak","15 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the latest movies from Sony Picture Animation and is about the coming of age of Miles Morales, the next Spiderman. After getting bitten by a radioactive spider, he gains the powers of Spiderman and after a run-in with Kingpin, he meets Spiderman variations from different universes and needs to work together to stop him from ending the universe.2018 has been a large year for superhero films and I gotta admit I was excited for this one, mostly because of the animation style. When that's taken out, I really enjoyed this movie. The animation's style looks like a 3D version of a literal superhero comic book, and the pacing makes it feel like one too. The action is fast-paced, crisp and it really made me wonder what was going to happen next. That alone makes this film stand out from any other mainstream animated movie, which feels really refreshing.Aside from that, I enjoyed the company of every protagonist. Every Spiderman variation has a different charm to them that makes each one memorable. Take the main character Miles, who has to come to terms with accepting his father's wishes in being a better person by not looking up to his uncle instead. I think that arc was handled really well. I could go deeper into come of the other characters, but that would spoil parts of the movie.If I were to name a couple small issues with the movie, I do think it contains a weakness that most good Marvel movies share and that's a good villain. Kingpin for the most part felt pretty generic and didn't seem to have much character going for him. Aside from that, I do wish they could've gone more in-depth with Miles' relationship with his father. I have no problem with the execution of it, but I would've like to have seen more.Despite this, I highly recommend seeing this for superhero movie fans, comic book fans and animation fans. It's got amazing animation, great characters, an engaging story and lots of heart.9/10","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","dbrown-74306","21 December 2018","I had my doubts when Sony said they they were making a new cartoon Spider-Man movie, considering their last outing was the Emjoi Movie.
The trailer displayed the artwork pretty well, but still I didn't want to get my hopes up. The reviews made it sound like the best Spiderman movie ever. So I went to the movie theater and watched it with my brother. And I was, in short absolutely captivated.Miles Morales is a teen protege growing up in Brooklyn with a hard nosed cop for a dad, a loving mother and an uncle, Aaron who helps him explore his ambition as a graffiti artist. The problem is the new school he goes to isn't the life he's looking for, and he is doing all he can to get out of it, against his family's wishes.But that all changes when he meets three people: a girl in his class named Gwen Stacy, a 26 year old blonde guy named Peter Parker and a radioactive spider.Because of a portal opened by Wilson Fisk, the dna of. Spider-Man attracts in alternate Spider-Ma.... i mean Spider-People, dragging them all into Miles' Brooklyn neighborhood. It's up to them, including a middle aged and cynical Peter, Spider-Woman, Spider- pig, and a depressed and grungy Spider-Man Noir, to stop Kingpin from using the portal again to rip a hole in the space time continuum.But that being said, that doesn't touch a bit on how hilarious, how heart breaking, and how endearing the scenes can be moment by moment. The animation and concept art go hand in hand, and gives the film a high tech, pop art appeal like nothing the world has ever seen at this scale or skill. Words can't describe the way this movie moves and feels like the best comic book ever written.I can't recommend this enough. Go watch this movie right now and you will not be disappointed But don't watch it if you have epilepsy or anything like that. It gets pretty flashy.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","varun-25071997","20 February 2019","Conceptually its brilliant but like every other superhero movie, there are way too much unnecessary action scenes which ruins the 2nd hour of the movie. Its visually stunning for an animation film and manages to be lively throughout by mixing humor and action like the Homecoming movie. But too often the characters are left under developed like the Spiderman Noir which really was disappointing because I was looking forward for Nicolas Cage. The soundtrack was fine and the song placements were perfect and as for the casting goes its very diverse and is a good representation for BAME. Overall its an interesting film with a great post credit scene but the major drawbacks are excessive action and a basic 3rd act.","4/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","idanporat","11 March 2019","I really enjoyed the animation, the art and the music. This movie has a real comics feel to it. However, it is far from being the masterpiece everyone is talking about.

Like many Marvel recent films, overhyped.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Benslie","15 December 2018","First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we've all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don't know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you'll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn't the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a ""Marvel""ous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would've been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would've been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn't overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn't make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you'll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn't overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","themadmovieman","6 December 2018","This is a genuinely exceptional film. Away from the world of the big-budget, mainstream comic book movies, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse breaks boundaries with a stunningly original and fresh take on the classic superhero tale, combining hilarious self-referential humour with an equally thrilling story, all topped off with spellbinding visuals from beginning to end.There's nowhere we can start from but the film's stunning animation. With clear love and passion for all things superhero poured into every single frame of Into The Spider-Verse, the film sings with its mesmerising comic-book style visuals, bordering on the edge of a kind of gritty stop-motion that blends seamlessly with individual panels, captions and even the odd THWACK or BIFF that pops up on the screen.But not only does this film bring comic books to life on the big screen like never before, because it also has a stunning and vivid urban vibe throughout that adds to the atmosphere and excitement of the whole affair. Again blurring the lines between gritty urban visuals and psychedelic, kaleidoscopic colours, the film is a dazzling watch, with cinematography that pops in hugely entertaining fashion throughout, adding to the jaw-droppingly good-looking nature of the film, all the while furthering its unique and distinct atmosphere.And that's the next thing I want to touch on, because although Into The Spider-Verse does centre on a big Marvel character, what makes it feel so fresh is that unique atmosphere. Of course, the visuals are integral in that, but there's something deeper that comes from the film's brilliant screenplay and passionate directing. Landing us in a parallel version of New York City, the movie has the opportunity to play with things we know and love, and give them an original twist to help set the foundations of this world apart from the mainstream comic book movies.As a result, this film completely breaks the rule book when it comes to modern superhero movies - surpassing even the likes of Deadpool with its originality - with a gleefully fun and playful take on comic book tropes and clich√©s, all the while still surging with an immensely exciting blockbuster plot that feels pleasantly familiar, but just different enough.So that means that you can enjoy Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse in a number of different ways, whether it be as a straight comic book blockbuster akin to the MCU and DCEU, a fresh and exciting urban thriller, a visual masterpiece filled with a kaleidoscope of colours, or even a flat-out hilarious comedy. There are few movies in the genre with that degree of diversity within, but it's that very fact that makes it such a stunning watch throughout, leaving you barely a minute to breathe as it enthralls you from every single angle.Finally, a mention about the film's comedy, which is absolutely amazing from beginning to end. It's a laugh-a-minute rollercoaster of a movie, with both well-written and character-driven humour throughout, as well as fantastically tongue-in-cheek, self-referential humour, doing for Spider-Man what Warner Bros.' hilarious The Lego Batman Movie did for the Caped Crusader, and a whole lot of winks and nods to modern superhero movies that are sure to have fans laughing on a near-constant basis.Overall, then, I was blown away by Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. For a film that seems so small at first, it's actually one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen, breaking out on its own in brilliantly unique fashion with an absolutely mesmerising visual template, a thoroughly exciting and original story, a passionate and tangible urban atmosphere, and utterly hilarious comedy from start to finish.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","stuartpbottomley","13 December 2018","The answer to that is YES. The best superhero movie ever, it's up there.
Great storytelling , great animation technique. The story buzzes along and doesn't stop the only flab is on the older Peter Parker. It self parodies Itself without ruining the story. Ignore the doubters and the ignorant one star reviews on here, go see it for yourself you won't be disappointed","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","sunraider","16 December 2018","The most over-hyped movie of the year. Now, I'm not a comic book fan, nor an MCU fan although I've enjoyed a few, especially ""Spider-Man Homecoming,"" which I loved as I'm a sucker for those teenage, coming of age tales. The animation style was lovely in this movie but, the plot was humdrum and there was little character development and none of the witty repartee that is such a hallmark of the best animated films that appeal to both children and adults. This should have focused on Miles Morales getting a disillusioned Peter Parker to train him and get his mojo back. THe other iterations of Spider-Man were unnecessary. This was truly little more than a mediocre kids' animated movie. The small audience in my Friday morning theater was exclusively adult and there was little reaction from the audience throughout. Sitting in the Dolby theater, with the recliner in use, I actually thought about taking a snooze at least a couple of times during the movie.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","donepudisrikar","20 December 2018","We all grew up with Spiderman, mine was Raimi's blockbuster trilogy. This film not only nods to those Masterpieces but gives us more. It was crazy to see the Spiderman PS4 suit in there along with the post credits scene throwing us way back to the comics. Also everytime nicholas cage spoke it was basically greatness (greatness awaits?)The plot while not complicated was well executed using fantastically funny internal monologues, well painted backstories, and of course beautiful action sequences which contain a crazy amount of Easter eggs btw! A Spiderverse shows the many shades of Spiderman, inspiring us as well to find our shade and take that leap of faith. I guess we are indeed Spiderman, Stan Lee. This movie makes you REALLY feel like spiderman.The one con I had with the movie was that while the movie didn't want to become another Peter Parker joint, Peters arc took up a significant amount of the time taking away from the other spider people (&pig). Maybe the movie could have been longer to use the others to strengthen Miles' arc into an even more explosive finale.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","gabrielmorenocorredor","24 December 2018","I give Sony a 10 for probably the most ambitious film to date of just the art being a comic book. The movie is also very impactful of the drama (watch out Disney Sony is coming) what I liked about this movie is for the cultures of different people in this movie (Go Hispanics/african Americans and Japanese people). The different Spiderman/women even thought I know who they were but it was fun to see them in a short easy version of explaining their backstory in a very short time. The drama which is awesome ,which beats all the Spiderman movies on drama. This One is the king of Spiderman movies aside the Tobey Maguire trilogy and Andrew Garfield movies. This is by far the most ambitious to make the different art styles for each character and how they show New York in this version.
P.S DO ANOTHER ONE with the same charisma and love that has a very meaning full way of spiderman","6/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","forpassord","27 December 2021","I have heard a lot about how great the animation in this movie is supposed to be... Yes, it is different, but I can not see anything about it that is better. Rather the opposite: The animation seemed simple, grainy and with some stuttering and strange coloring at times. So NO: Different is NOT necessarily the same as better... Mixing anime and the cartoon style in this movie just clashed. Together with the style at the end of the movie that looked like the animators were drugged on hallucinogens made the animation messy and inconsistent.In addition to the animation, this move continues the idiotic trends these days with distorting superheroes into something COMPLETELY different instead of creating new characters, and thereby cannibalizing on the established characters! I have no problems what so ever with female superheroes (I LOVED ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) for example), or super heroes with other skin colors than white (like The Hulk ;-) (PS: That was a JOKE...!), and I liked Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon for example), but I HATE when an established character is turned into something completely different in stead of creating a NEW character!!! A third trend that I dislike these days are children/teenagers that take over and saves the day when experienced adults are unable to.The anime girl and her robot, and the Disneyesque/Simpsonesque ""Spider-Pig was just malplaced in this movie and idiotic!As mentioned earlier: The animation towards the end is just a mess and looks like a hallucination! And the sequence after the end credits was just idiotic. There are several reasons for why that kind of acting/dialogues no longer are in movies, animated or otherwise. People behind this movie should have stuck to making Lego movies for children.In the end: If you like the devolution of Sider Man into the childish character in the most recent Spider-Man movies with Tom Holland, I suspect that you will like this movie. But if you, as I do prefer Spider-Man as an adult as in the movies with Maguire/Garfield, then I suspect that you too will not like this movie.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","RussHog","17 December 2018","This film has moments but I am not a big fan of Brian Michael Bendis and his weird politics or the inside jokes he filters into work. This film is Bendis on steroids and LSD. Peter Parker is a washed up white guy (hello America) and the future is Miles Morales - a black / latino kid & a white woman (Gwen) who is independent and puts Miles in the friend zone. They rip the classic Kingpin design of Bill Sienkiewicz. I honestly feel this movie was trying to brainwash me or something. I wasn't big fan of the animation.","10/10"

I respect the animation which was original, wonderful and some of the best you will see but I just don't enjoy these types of movies. Sorry. Everything was just too hectic especially the soundtrack. It was just way to OTT. I also had a real issue with our own Spider-Man Peter Parker who they portrayed as a loser/slob. It grated on me. Miles is cool though. I get why people like it but just not my thing.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","aidanratesmovies","28 November 2021","Although on paper and of course aesthetically this film seems rather pleasing- Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse feels like a missed opportunity of epic proportions- hardly showing any emotion and lacking the depth to triscend it into something extraordinary. I'll start with the pros for this film, I love the animation. Yes it can be a bit jumpy and flashy at times, but it's an incredibly unique and magnificently detailed art style- not to mention its comic like quality in the terms of a comic book based superhero film. The voice work is also pretty well done for the most part, my favorite being Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker and the smaller cameos from John Mulaney and Nicolas Cage as Spider-Ham and Spider-Noir. The film has good intentions and a sweet message, and it's fun to see all the different variations of our favorite characters on screen, but it just seems to lack the emotional depth and charm that so many other films have. It's a trend that has taken a lot of potentially great superhero films down to blissful mediocrity, and never has it been more prevalent to me here. Its formulaic attributes and pacing, and even rhythm at times makes it seem more artificial than genuine and I just feel like it misses the point of what it is trying to say. It has all the right elements, and it even works at times, but it could have been so much more impactful than it was, and that just makes me sad. In the end, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not at all a bad film, but a mediocre one with somehow high accord. I feel its potential is often greater than its execution and in most people's eyes, they may not be able to tell the difference. I just hope the second one is an improvement.My Rating: 6.4/10.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Dorkboss","19 December 2018","Out of every Spider-Man movie I've seen, this movie is the most satisfying Spider-Man film I've ever watched. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse not only tells the story about Miles Morales becoming Spider-Man, but a machine that has the ability to open the multiverse that holds many Spider-People such as Spider-Gwen, Noir Spider-Man, Spider-Pig, etc.While the story is both great and fun, the film also has heart added to the film which is great because you really get attach to the character especially Miles who I really feel for throughout the movie. The animation is really like a comic book is coming to life, not only does the animation helps the action sequence looks so awesome, but each Spider-Character has their own animation style that looks good.With Sony co-owning the Spider-Man rights, along with the MCU, I can see the possibility of this movie having a sequel, they don't need to retell the same story of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man many times, they can open up the world that is full of Spider-People such as Spider-Man 2099, Scarlet Spider-Man, Cosmic Spider-Man, Spider Carnage, and more.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Ziglet_mir","12 January 2020","Heard all the great reviews on this, got excited to see it, and was majorly disappointed. The animation was different and I can certainly appreciate how it reminded me of stop-motion (it is also super colorful), but it gets blurry and weird at times, and I'm not exactly sure what this accomplishes.I am glad to see King Pin as the villain, and I'll be honest I'm not totally up to date with the Miles Morales story arc, but none of that is what made the film disappointing. As already mentioned, the animation is overhyped (colors are pretty and some sequences are well made), but if we are honestly talking about best animation ever... there are at least half a dozen movies made in the last decade that would surpass this IMO (Kubo and the Two Strings probably being the best).Then, the story falls flat and I never felt like there was anything at stake. The universe gets mixed up and Miles is just trying to find his courage in being a hero. Nothing ever feels dire. Most of the comedy falls flat except for some good jokes being made at passed Spider-Man movies and Peter Parker. Far from the best animation ever as most are dubbing it and also far from being awful. I'll probably be one of the few reviews that sits middle of the road.","10/10"

Not entirely sure why the main kid has the powers he does because it seems to have nothing to do with a spider but a robotic spider??
Nevertheless it was cool and the story was fun.
HOWEVER its clear the film was animated for 3D but when I watched it in my 2 d theater the normally blurred images in the background (the way we humans see things) were occasionally double images, the likes of which you see in a 3d movie when you watch for a second without the glasses.

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","reesepaul","6 December 2018","I was very lucky as my son and I just got to see the movie before it comes out. I was very impressed. The animation work alone was some of the most impressive work I have ever seen. Thencolorations, and fluidity of movement made a comic book come to life as a motion picture. Props to the soundtrack it was great edgy New York hip Hop in places, heck even works St. Elmo's fire in. I was surprised at the excellent humor throughout.Technically as an older male my knowledge of Spider Man was confined to the classic Peter Parker line. I didn't know of this multiverse. But seeing is believing and it all made sense in the film. I had no idea Spider Ham existed but you will love his parts.I don't and won't spoil the story line but as you can imagine good vs bad many excellent fight scenes. Dr. OC and Kingpin battle the several spider people. If you like animated movies, Marvel comics, go see this movie FYI stay all the way through the credits for a very funny finale.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","abramzjeremenko","18 December 2018","I personally not see the appeal in movies like this. However, when I sat down and watched this in theaters, I'd have to say that it's the best movie I've in 2018. For those who haven't see this film, I won't spoil any of the plot points. Getting that out of the way I loved many styles the film portrayed. The films way of creating a layered animation, in which, you can see multiple different versions of the same person or object. It mostly gave off the feel of looking through the eyes of a spider.I was also happy to see in this film that they didn't keep dragging on the same story, but just using different actors or scenes. No film, like Spider-Man Homecoming, gave a new outlook on Spider-Man. With a diverse cast whom all seemed to voice act perfectly, my favorite being John Mulaney, they didn't just feel like a bland group of individuals. Instead, the film allowed for the audience to really connect with each character. I don't think that the animation ruins it, I also don't think that it would have changed the quality of the film if it wasn't animated.So, what can a really say? Well, I came into the movie theaters expecting another super-hero movie, but instead, I got to watch a miraculous film that makes me want to become a super-hero fan. It was perfect and amazing.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","andreaf-78503","20 December 2018","This movie was outstanding! After seeing The Emoji Movie last year, I had low expectations for any Sony movie coming out. After I found out this movie was coming out, I was nervous. Being a Marvel fan at heart, I didn't like the idea of a Marvel movie being put in the hands of Sony. After watching the trailers, I got more hopeful and decided I would check it out. And boy am I glad I did. This movie is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. Let's start with my favorite part of the movie, the animation. I absolutely loved the idea of an animated movie being told as a comic book. It was so colorful. Sure it was a bit blurry at times (once to the point where my friend thought we went to the 3D version on accident) but it made up for it. The part where the glass breaks from the building was beautiful. And Kingpin's body was hilarious. 10/10 for animation. Next, storyline. It was a pretty good story line, but it could've used a bit more work. The beginning was a bit confusing but I would say I was just about as confused as Miles was. One clich√© thing though was that if the rest of the Spider people didn't get back to the universe they would disintegrate. Very funny Marvel, very funny. One thing that was really shocking was how(SPOLIER ALERT!!!!!!!) Aaron was secretly Prowler. That shocked the heck out of me. I liked Kingpin's motivation, but I could point it out a mile away. 8/10 for storyline. Last but not least, characters. I personally really enjoyed the characters. I loved that some of the Spider characters got a chance at the big screen. Miles was my favorite by far. I also enjoyed that they had a different version of Peter Parker. The middle-aged, overweight, divorced side of him. I wished they would do a bit more character development for the other characters though. 9/10 for characters. One last thing. I found it really touching that they did a tribute to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko after the credits. They would be very proud of this movie.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","nickgray-12862","3 January 2019","Miles Morales might just be my favourite Marvel character.

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Dello_","16 October 2022","""Spider-Man into the spider-verse"" is truly an animation masterpiece. It is hands-down the best Spider-Man movie, and one of the best superhero movies ever made. But why is it so? I usually tend not to give maximum ratings to movies, because I think that to be worthy of that 10/10 they need to be great, but also have something very special about them. In this case it is the animation style, that in the end is a comic translated into a movie. This animation is style is not only there to be beautiful, but also it enriches the scenes and the story points thanks to some inspired visual solutions. But is the plot able to take advantage of the animations style? Yes, it does. Indeed, it is entertaining, fun, but also profound and moving in few instances. And finally, also the score is really great and the songs are perfect. The best example of it is the ""what's up danger"" scene, that is able to give me chills every single time I watch it.In the end, ""Spider-Man into the spider-verse ""is a very very good movie. If you are a Spider-Man fan you will probably love it, but even if you're not and you don't usually see superheroes movies, I think that this one is a great watch anyway.","8/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","troy-daniel-bush","20 September 2023","I like that line! It made me feel something.My first time watching this ever and I really enjoyed it. (Duh, right?) A unique style of animation that you'd think would be a detriment to the action scenes, but it really isn't.The action scenes were a lot of fun.Most of the jokes landed for me. I especially enjoyed the slapstick. The birds... LOL!All of the voice acting is great, for the most part. I especially liked Jake Johnson, Nicolas Cage, Kathryn Hahn, and Hailee Steinfeld.Likeable characters with satisfying arcs.Miles was a fun protagonist to followMy favorite character was Noir Spiderman. And I felt Nicolas Cage was a good choice for that character. His voice made him sound old-fashioned, and his voice helped make the character funny without even trying.I love how Miles learns how to be Spider-Man by reading Spider-Man comics.The twist with Prowler was unexpected.Speaking of twists, when the Doctor revealed her name to be Olivia Octavius I was like, ""Oh crap.""I like most of the character designs.I liked the music.However...The more I think about it, the more I think the usage of a certain licensed song was inappropriate. I'm aware that this is a common criticism and it's common for a reason. It happens at a moment in the film, where it supposed to be emotionally resonant, and it kind of takes away from the intended impact of the scene.I think the movie feels longer than it is. That might change on my second watch.I personally did not like this movie's choice of having Kingpin as the main villain at all. I feel like there are more threatening villains they could've chosen, especially in this movie. I wish the main villain was just Kathryn Hahn's Doc Ock. I found her threatening-enough, as well as deliciously sadistic. And I found Kingpin's design to be incredibly distracting. In all honest, I cannot stand his design. Hahn's Doc Ock looked awesome. I also didn't like Goblin's design. Why is he giant? And where's his glider? Or Scorpion's. I don't like the fact he looks like the Scorpion King at the end of The Mummy Returns.While I didn't mind the Porky Pig Spider-Man, John Mulaney's voice was very distracting. It reminded me of Steve Buscemi in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. (Don't watch that, by the way. Unless you're a masochist. Or if you want to know how to not write a script.)How did Kingpin teleport out of his van before shooting his gun? There was no sound from the car door opening or closing. Then again, maybe it's cartoon logic? I mean, how does he even fit in that tiny car? Lol. Also, during that scene, shouldn't have Miles' Spidey-Sense gone off? Or does that only work if the gun is being pointed at him? The slow-motion following the gunshot was unintentionally funny, too.I did not feel for Kingpin's plight whatsoever, and that's not a result of his character design. I just didn't like him or his role in the film.Also, when you break down the plot, it's pretty standard. However, the animation style, characters, action, and humor make the generic plot totally worth it.Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite Spider-Man. Yeah, I have nostalgia for the Raimi Spiderman movies, and yeah, I am a Raimi shill. But even if those things weren't true, Spider-Man 2 would still be my favorite. The poignant story, the music, action, the villain, Alfred Molina's performance, etc. Plus, there are things in it I personally connect with. Although, Gwen Stacy in this movie is a lot more likeable love-interest than Mary Jane.Looking forward to watching Across the Spiderverse. Apparently, it's darker than the first one, and I love me some darkness.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","CANpatbuck3664","23 December 2018","I didn't think much of the animation style of this movie when I saw the trailer, it didn't catch my eye and before I learned more about who was involved, my first thought was that it might be a straight to VOD or Blu Ray release. Getting to see it in the theatre, I was blown away. The animation is fantastic, it has its own sense of style, but the colour palette is bright, and the movie is constantly moving throughout its environments. It looks as good as any big studio animation movie for kids if not better. What makes it even more amazing is how the action scenes are put together. They're stunning, the movie is inventive with how they use their characters and you never lose focus of what's happening, but you feel the hits and each character gets bad@$$ moments to show what they can do. In a bloated superhero movie landscape, to get something that kept me this engaged from a visual standpoint is impressive.I prefer my superhero characters to have rough edges and to have some flaws when they dole out justice. Its one of the reasons superheroes like Ironman or anti heroes like Deadpool work so well. I liked Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as a character because he has a hard time picking up how to be Spiderman, because he has a hard time making the tough choices and because he's so new to this job. He also has some relatable problems (being homesick, trying to live up to expectations, having to choose between what's right and what's easy) that help endear him to the audience. He's a good kid at a difficult time in his life. I also like the fact that they have other superhero characters like Jake Johnson's Peter Parker, Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld) and others to provide some contrast to his style of being Spiderman. But you also have more human characters such as Jefferson (Brian Tyree Henry), Aaron (Mahershala Ali) that present more real-world consequences and represent the different branches he could take depending on what he chooses to do. Especially with his family, things get dark and they really sell the drama of what's going on with Miles and the consequences of his actions.You've got both the action and the drama but the best part of Into the Spider-Verse is the comedy. This movie is gut-busting hilarious, the dialogue is razor sharp and they aren't afraid to get meta or to poke fun at the genre. I saw this with a friend and she described it as Deadpool for kids with the film pointing out dialogue boxes, going into comics for visual representations of origin stories and pulling scenes out of the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies and making jokes about them. So much of the funny content in this movie comes from the alternate universe Spidermen and Spiderwomen and more specifically the Jake Johnson version of Peter Parker. He nails line after line and left me giggling every time. One of the small complaints I had about this movie is that it was so entertaining as a comedy, when it got dramatic (and to be fair those parts are done well too) I waited on the edge of my seat till the jokes started flying again.The voice cast is good across the board and other than my continuous praise for Jake Johnson, everyone does at minimum a descent job. Again, some of my favourites were the alternate universe Spidermen with Nicolas Cage, John Mulaney, Hailee Steinfeld (Gwen is in that category) and Kimiko Glenn all doing unique takes on their characters to round out the cast. Chris Pine is solid in his all too brief appearance as Peter. I really like Mahershala Ali and Brian Tyree Henry as Aaron and Jefferson. Liev Schrieber does what he can as Kingpin, he doesn't get many dialogue heavy scenes, but he gets the job done. I also thought while Shameik was decent as Miles, he gave more of a nondescript performance.This movie was an outright joy to watch. I had heard it was good going in, but it surpassed high expectations. My advice is don't just lump Spider-Verse into the group, it represents what superhero movies need to do to avoid plateauing. You have to change things up and try new things and I think this version of Spider-Man did that for sure. I'm eagerly awaiting a sequel from the same team and although I was late to see this, don't make the same mistake if you love this genre. I wholeheartedly recommend Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and I was close to giving it a 10/10 but I'll still go 9/10 for a couple of small missteps.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","MarcusMaatta","21 February 2019","This movie is like the most beautiful canvas with a perfect pace, soundtrack and setting. Each character sets their own mark as a personality and animation, and I have not been this stunned by an animated movie (outside of Japan) since Fantastic mr. Fox. My only complaint is the lack of depth but all movies do not need to have an amazing plot twist or intellectual revelation.It is what it is, and I really hope this is the start of something new.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","15 December 2018","I totally enjoyed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in IMAX 3D. It was action-packed, funny, at times emotional, inspiring & completely exhilarating. A TRUE comic-book movie. Great for kids & families. It has also got a great, memorable music. As it's a Spidey movie, there's a lot of action as said before and it's executed very well. Every single Spidey is impressive. It's not only for kids but also for adults who won't mind bringing out the kid within themselves. I myself felt like those days, when I watched animated Spider-Man on television with an action figure in my hand, were back.In short, it's a must watch action-adventure movie. Plus, there's an interesting post credits scene, so if you want, you can stay. And of course, love and respect for you Stan Lee, may your soul rest in peace.","9/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","nimdude","13 December 2018","This one is a complete home run. I'm pretty sure that the praise for this movie will be positively one-sided and for very good reason.Quickly touching on the negative . Like there's only two things I didn't like about this movie. The first is the narrative cliche's found in every super hero movie ever so its not a big fault but it happens and it annoys me but only ever so slightly. The second is when a character learns a particular skill set just by deciding he wants to be good at it, its an unconvincing way to further the story and a pretty lazy one.But all that is only about 5% of the whole movie. The rest is an absolute overload of the senses in a very very good way.I don't want to mention the characters in this movie because some of them might surprise you so all of them worked and all of them were fantastic.The movie is crazy funny, and its funny in a way that is actually refreshing in modern blockbusters. Its funny without being political. CONGRATULATIONS you didn't make any politically charged jokes that are one sided in a big budget Sony movie. I hope this new trend continues where jokes aren't politicized in movies.The voice acting is spot on from everyone, don't want to mention names as some might be a surprise.I find the story to be almost on par with everyones favorite Spider-Man stories (Rami) in terms of quality, mainly because all the central themes and character morality are there in the story. Power, responsibility and all that jazz. It isn't empty like in the Amazing Spider-Man .The thing that surprised me most about this movie (aside from how genuinely funny it is) is how much emotion there is at it's core. Family, friends and sacrifice are a huge undertone of the movies core message.The main thing I took away from the film is the visuals. Holy every god ever this movie is gorgeous as hell. The most gorgeous in recent memory, and certainly my personal favorite visuals in an animated movie ever.9.3/10","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","moviexclusive","7 December 2018","Before you groan that 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is yet another origin story on the titular superhero, let us reassure you that this animated action-comedy from the irreverent minds which brought you 'The LEGO Movie' is like no other origin story you've seen.And truly we mean that in a good, even great way: producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, together with a trio of directors (Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman), have completely embraced the freedom that the animated genre provides in adapting the array of comic books of the Spider-Man canon. Untethered from the sort of realism that live-action movies are bound to, they have instead created a film with an ultra-stylistic, hyper-kinetic, over-caffeinated aesthetic that is visually dazzling in its own right.Amalgamating Ben-Ray dots, hand-drawn effects and soft-focus backgrounds (reminiscent of the old non-polarised 3D movies with blurry red and blue edges), with a deliberately stilted frame-rate and signature comic-book elements of panelisation and dialogue boxes, it is probably the closest we've come to see of a comic recreated in motion. To be sure, it does get a little over-indulgent at times; in particular, the retina-searing finale that takes place inside a universe-collapsing subterranean device resembles what you may get within an overly aggressive lava lamp, playing like the most sustained stream of vibrant psychedelia we've ever recalled seeing. It's breath-taking all right, even breathless at some points, but there is no denying the imagination and originality that is on display.The same can be said of Lord's script, co-written with Rothman, that boldly imagines a formula-busting origin story with a potent emotional core. At the centre of it is the character of Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), a Brooklyn Afro-Latino teenager having trouble adjusting to life inside a new elite boarding school. Miles, who first appeared in the comic seven years ago from writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli, has had great expectations thrust upon him by his NYPD cop-father Jefferson (Brian Tyree Henry) and nurse-mother Rio (Luna Lauren Velez), but prefers hanging out with his father's estranged brother Uncle Aaron (Mahershala Ali) graffitiing the subways.In Miles' version of New York City, Peter Parker's Spider-Man (Jake Johnson) is a well-established community hero/ vigilante, but Miles realises that Peter's powers aren't quite that exclusive when he himself is bitten by a radioactive spider. Unfortunately, before Peter can teach Miles how to properly navigate his newfound powers, the former is killed while trying to stop the Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) from using his nuclear super-collider from ripping a gash in the space-time continuum and causing several alternate universes to collapse onto the present.Thankfully for Miles, that same machine also opens up portals in other parallel universes, pulling in several alternate Spider-People into his universe. These include a paunchy, washed-up 40-year-old Peter Parker (Johnson again); the graceful, ass-kicking and too-cool-for-school Spider-Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld); the hard-boiled, black-and-white Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage); the cartoonish Peter Porker a.k.a. Spider-Ham (John Mulaney); and last but not least, the anime-inspired Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and her arachno-droid SP//dr.Even with upwards of seven Spider-beings and five bad guys (besides the Kingpin, there is also Doc Ock, Prowler, Tombstone and Scorpion in the rogues' gallery), the movie never comes off overstuffed, thanks to a surprisingly poignant relationship between Miles and Peter.Ultimately, this is Miles' coming-of-age story that sees him struggling to step up to the mantle in order to save the world. Next to Miles, the curmudgeonly Peter is both his foil and his mentor, and their relationship is the heart and soul of the movie. In fact, they anchor some of the best sequences in the movie: their first encounter which finds both of them bound and dragged by a subway train through the streets of New York is both exciting and hilarious; and Peter's lesson to Miles how to web-swing through from tree to tree in upstate New York while being chased by Doc Ock is also both exhilarating and joyous to watch.Yet we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge that 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' does sometimes veer into excess. As unapologetically self-referential as it is, its self-awareness sometimes proves too clever for its own good, tipping so far into fan service that it comes off rather self-indulgent. It is also guilty of resorting to the same superhero comic-book clich√©s that it pokes a postmodern finger at, most notably how the key to disarming the Kingpin's supercollider is a simple USB device. And there is so much going on that certain emotional notes do not ring as loudly as they should, and that is especially true of the family triangle comprising Miles, his cop dad and his cool uncle that feels less fleshed out than it should be.Even so, this is one of the most original superhero origin stories we've seen in a very long while, and that alone says a lot for a character like Spider-Man which has seen no less than three reboots over the past few years. With this high-concept animated movie, Sony has finally moved on from Peter Parker in a manner that acknowledges his significance and expand the Spider-Verse in fresh and exciting ways. Credit to that belongs very much to Lord and Miller, whose sensibilities are all over the movie, ranging from its witty quips to its breakneck pace to its meta-textual treatment.Fans of the Spider-Man comics will quite surely love it to bits, but there is also plenty for the casual viewer to enjoy in this fast, funny and thrilling piece of definitive pop-culture. It is brilliant all right, and we dare say one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","erenerginler","21 December 2018","I'm not a person who likes to rewatch movies right after finishing them. But for this, I can say that everything has a first.Let's get the obvious out of the way, the animation. I love how this movie looks. The creators really put effort in making this. There are scenes where text appears on screen. It literally looks like a comic book. And while I haven't read many comic books, I still think it looks amazing. I also appreciate how Peni Parker is drawn like an anime girl, and Spider-Ham (aka my favorite one) is drawn like a character from loony toones. But everyone has talked about the animation, so you probably know anyway.The story is as amazing as the animation. Well not quite, but close. If you didn't know, this movie is about this villian king pin (if I'm getting that right) who opens portals to 5 different dimensions. Each one brings a new spider person. But the main character isn't even peter, it's miles. Miles gets bitten right before the dimension opening, and so he is a noob for most the movie. Ok I'll stop the spoilers. The emotion in this movie, while predictable, is pretty powerful. The humor, which is important to me, is pretty good. And while that mainly comes from the spectacular peter porker, there are some other good jokes too.My probably biggest complaint is that the sidekicks (noir ham and peni) weren't used enough. Like I know this is about miles, and peter and Gwen play a big role in that, the sidekicks were advertised a lot too, and they barely got any screen time. Although in the final battle, peni and ham get pretty good scenes.
Overall, I can't wait to rewatch this when it's on dvd, and please just go see it.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","alexthegreat350","14 December 2018","My expectations were pretty high, I knew this film was gonna be good, but not THIS good. I mean I could give this film a 10 on animation alone. Its bright colors, fluid movements almost like a music video, and those comic book text boxes across the screen were a brilliant artistic choice. I realize that with movies like this the more obvious aspects like amazing action and visuals can make me not even think about the amazing character relationships and dialogue. The triangle between Miles, Jefferson an his uncle(sorry I forget lol) felt very realistic and grounded. Miles had a specific soft spot for his uncle, which was explored early on in the film. I really enjoyed how Jefferson wasn't a hardass annoying dad, and he wasn't a softie. He was just a guy, that wasn't 100% sure how to reach out to miles, but that didn't matter because he was doing his best. Also the talent from the amazing voice acting cast was undeniable. As a huge big mouth fan I kept finding myself laughing at John Mulaney as Peter porker. Not to mention they got Nicholas cage, who felt very natural for Spider noir. Who doesn't love that guy. I was pretty happy to see the concept of the multiverse explored in this movie, and I loved the brief, but still unique and interesting takes on each of the characters universe. I would love to see a solo movie for one of these characters, but I feel like thats a bit of stretch. I also want to talk about the most grabbing and probably the best aspect fo this film, the incredible visuals. I have always been a fan of animated films and TV, because with animation, there is not creative limit. Those limits, or lack there of is clearly on display for a majority of this film. Some of the shots and scenes (Especially the final act) just look like they would be incredibly difficult and/or expensive to film in live action. Not impossible though of course because we all saw ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Any-who I was constantly looking up at the screen in awe as I watched these beautifully animated and well developed swinging around the screen. I really enjoyed watching miles grow from not knowing what he was doing at all do understanding and really feeling his powers, with the help of Peter Parker. Speaking of Peter and Miles, I love the kind of relationship they shared, almost comparable to a really cool teacher and a student who desperately anted to learn everything. Overall this film had Excellent characters and character building, stunning visuals, beautiful animation, amazing cast, and an amazing script with dialogue that felt like a real conversation, and at times, very very funny. Point is go watch this movie ASAP it truly is a spectacular, colorful, work of art.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","CinemaSerf","24 October 2022","I'm still a little wary of this multi-verse theme. I find it can lead to some seriously lazy writing as inter-dimensional characterisations can write, then re-write their own pasts and futures in a fashion that can become dull and repetitive quickly. This is not one of those. It centres around ""Miles"", a young lad who likes to hang out with his wayward uncle ""Aaron"" and who has a penchant for street art. It's whilst they are decorating an underground wall that he gets bitten by a spider and soon afterwards starts to feel the effects of his spidery-transformation. Meantime, the real ""Spider-Man"" aka ""Peter Parker"" falls foul of the evil ""Kingpin"" who has created a collider that will enable him to enter parallel realities in the hope of reuniting with his family, tragically lost to him years earlier. The more he messes with the timeline, though, the more chaotic the effects and the more our new, trainee, ""Spider-Man"" meets his equivalents from those different dimensions. It isn't long before they conclude that only as a team can they hope to thwart the megalomaniac and young ""Miles"" must find new inner strength to take charge of this mission to ensure all his colleagues get safely home. It's a good, characterful, story this - the youngster finding his feet and learning to use his new-found skills is entertaining to watch. The dialogue is frequently quite amusing, and the action scenes hold the attention rather than recycle themselves endlessly. As I watched it, I wondered if it might have made for a good exercise for 3D cinema. As it is, though, it's quickly paced with plenty of action, a little food-for-thought and it might just be the most ""human"" of the Spidey iterations I've yet seen.","10/10"

Its colorful, sketchy, comic book style but like dope.The best part is story tho. The problem with spiderman is that, its always somehow an origin story and we have dozens of those by now. Aaaand this one is also an origin story, however its not. It is but its told in such a way that you don't feel bored. You wanna know more, you get excited for it.Honestly I can keep rambling about it..i loved it, everyone i know loved it. Its freaking lovely.Watch it. And watch it in a cinema.

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","realmuthaf","16 December 2018","I didn't quite expect this level of good when going to the cinema - Into The Spider-Verse ended up delivering on pretty much everything.The jokes are actually funny - no underage cringy garbage shoehorned by Disney into their movies. Special thanks to Nicholas ""Noir"" Cage. The visual style is astonishing, pays close homage to the comics, but still looks distinct and aesthetically pleasing. The drama here surprisingly works, and some moments in this movie are very far from being childish. Of course the Spider-Verse also has a ton of references to everything from the Raimi trilogy to the recent PS4 game, and they're also great, make sure to stay for the after-credits scene. Even the protagonist Morales also works, as opposed to the aforementioned PS4 game, where he was kind of dull.So yeah, miles (no pun intended) ahead of the MCU and of Sony's own previous live-action attempts, Into The Spider-Verse is a great animated movie, totally looking forward to the announced spin-off and sequel.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","K-Noah","27 December 2018","Was that very hard to make a very decent Spider-man movie, Sony?Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse is directed by Peter Ramsey, Robert Persichetti Jr. and Rodney Rothman, screenplay by Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman, and voices-starring by Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld and Mahershala Ali.Story by Phil Lord, and it's about Brooklyn teen Miles Morales, and the limitless possibilities of the Spider-Verse, where more than one can wear the mask.First time I heard about this movie I wasn't that hype about the idea of the movie or the animation. The trailer wasn't so clear about its animation, or the very bold storyline! When I went to see this movie I was blown away by the striking animation and the bold storytelling.. I think it's a very risky step for Sony to take, to make a very unique, new and comic-alike animation, I mean what if the audience didn't like it? It could have been a big disappointing movie, because it has an amazing story, I think this story is definitely the best story of the whole Spiderman movies, also the animation is amazing, it's flawless!
When an animation movie brings the live-action movies down, it means that it's definitely unique and bold!!The story didn't take so long to get you into the main plot, it went with its surprising ""scene"" -I'm not gonna spoil anything in this review- and though it made a very good introduction of the characters, so the first act was very good, shocking and humorous too!The second act still a very funny and thrilling as the first act, introducing the rest of the characters, so it took more time to get us back to the main plot, and I loved it, because some characters wasn't that clear in the first act that I wanted to know more about, and others that I wanted more of their backstories because I liked them! After introducing the ""rest of the characters"" we get another shocking scene, driving us to another shocking scene.. excuse me if I'm mysterious about some stuff, but I don't want to spoil anything, and still, if you watched the movie, you're gonna understand me very well.The third act was very predictable though, but still very thrilling because of its amazing animation combined with the amazing action, and emotions... Oh yeah, the third act is completely emotional, and action-full!There're not any subplots like Fantastic Beasts the Crimes of Grindelwald or something, it's very straight and clear.. very good for kids, and amazing for Spider-man fans and adults as well.I think that Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse is the Spider-Man that we deserve as fans of Spider-Man and it's definitely the best Spider-Man movie of all the time.! And of course, Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse gets an A+!Alright, guys.. thank you as always for reading and supporting my work, and if you liked this you can click on my name above and read all of my reviews, lots of movie-reviews are coming ahead.. thanks again!","5/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","benj-20839","12 December 2018","99% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is the Highest rated DC and Marvel movie EVER! And an 8.6 IMDB rating...so i had high hopes going in, plus i love the previous Spider-Man movies but boy was this one average, below average actually hence my 4/10. I feel duped by the critics AGAIN. The critics scores for this movie are WAY too suspicious for this.Let's get the animation out of the way first since they seem to be raving about it so much. Through watching many many animations we all know that nice visuals don't make for an entertaining film, especially if the other components of storytelling don't add up. The animation was as good as any good ones out there already, so i would say that it's not a good reason to go and spend loads on money at the cinema for that reason alone. This definitely can be watched at home. At random times throughout the film they do this kind of 3D visuals animation which give your eyes and head a funny turn tbh. If you've watched a 3D movie without glasses then you'll know what i mean.The film was so haphazard editing and story wise that it really took you out of the flow of the story, so it made it difficult to stay connected to the characters and story. This made it feel like it was aimed at young children to stop them from losing interest. It almost just felt like constant random scenes which didn't flow smoothly story wise.The other thing that made the film tiresome when trying to connect to the characters/story was the use of jokes/one-liners, they were relentless and was full of them. I love comedy in superhero films, the MCU do a great job of that and the previous Spider-Man movies too but this was like a kids animation style of non-stop but with adult humour, that i'm afraid i didn't laugh at once...and i usually laugh at nearly everything. Besides myself, there was only an adult and 2 children in the screen and i didn't hear them laugh either tbh.The story was pretty standard, exactly what the trailer tells you but i did get restless and bored when there was no action.Its my least favourite Spider-Man movie and as animations go its not good either, especially when you've got Pixar, Illuniation, Manga, etc delivering such epic and fun movies already.Nicolas Cage was my favourite Spider-Man in this, even though he wasn't one of the central characters and didn't get much screen time. It would be great if they made a film just centered around his character sometime.There were 2 or 3 short emotional scenes in this that i liked, i'm a sucker for that stuff lol.There is a post-credits scene so stay til the very end.4/10.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","jhalcollege","22 December 2018","This movie is definitely not as good as everyone is making it out to be.The movie starts off simply enough. Miles is your average Hollywood teen, who is the son of the only police officer in New York City. And if you want to see yet another person get bitten by a radioactive spider, then you're in luck.75% of the film is Miles trying and failing to be Spiderman. He's incapable of controlling any of his powers, and does little more than get in the way and utter cliche lines such as ""I have to do this. I promised."" It's rather frustrating to watch. But conveniently, he figures everything out in the last half hour and becomes a better hero than all the other Spidermen who've been in the business for years.Speaking of everyone else, as the story progresses, the audience is introduced to more and more Spiderman variations (and more unusual villains). With so much content, they barely get any more than just a few minutes of screen time. Spiderman Noir was interesting, for the five lines he had. I'm pretty sure there was some kind of Penny Porker character, but I may be mistaken. There's also a Scorpion villain who shows up out of nowhere, then mostly disappears.As a whole, the movie was filmed assuming that the audience's attention span is a about 1 second. Most jokes are cringe worthy, especially after you've seen them in the trailer. There's also way too much flash going on, and the movie's final scene is about as visually complex as a Jackson Pollock spatter painting.Spiderverse doesn't do anything that hasn't been done time and again.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","u-66754","24 December 2018","This must be the most impressive animation for me this year and the whole movie is beyond my imagination!Sony and Columbia really have done a great job, the music, the scenes and the spot are really excellent. As a crazy comics fan (both Japanese comics and American comics), the expression of this movie undoubtedly wins my heart. At first I was a little worried about the fusion of 3-D and 2-D and lower frames, the finished movie completely removes my worry, even I prefer this form than common animation! At the beginning of the movie, I was not into the mood of it and felt kind of strange. Then getting used to it, I felt like I was in a huge comic book. Every scene's just so fascinating, like a page of a comic book. Of course if you are more used to reality TV shows and movies, you may not like this expression XD.The fusion of comics in this movie, to a certain extent, is a supplement for limitation of 3-D animation. It is hard to directly (visually) show the inner side of a scene in a pure 3-D animation. The word it posts, the switching color it shows, extremely enhance the sense in that scene, such as the shot part. I think Disney's 3-D animation is more and more pursuing the sense of reality, and it is sophisticated to copy the sense of exaggeration, which is easily conveyed in a 2-D animation movie. Hope that more companies can consider more innovative expression of animation, instead of making orthodox animations all the time.Back to the movie itself, under excellent background music, the narrative, the pace, the characters and emotional expressions are great, better than some superhero movies. The main topic is absolutely ""Expectations"", and the whole movie clings close to it. Miles yearns for Spider-Man and shoulders expectations from his mates. Conflicts between father and son, Peter and MJ are solved in the end. The description of growing, friendship, family and love is very touching, thanks to excellent music and pace-controlling.Somehow I perceive kind of shadow of Japanese animation, don't know it is my illusion or because of Peni Parker XD. I think Sony is suitable for this kind of movies.As defects, maybe this kind of expression is not suitable for some audiences. Such as dizziness in the background, I'm fascinated by this unique style personally, but I find some people think it makes them dizzy. And the plot in the middle part is kind of disfluent and averaged.And, hardly count it as a defect, the final fight is so so so gorgeous and extraordinary! I was completely captured by the switching color in the background and could not focus on the fight! (My bad!!)In general, I really adore this movie and hope you all guys can watch it!","9/10"

The first hour of the film was pointless and boring. Story was non-exsistent bringing characters that were never on the screen long enough to be explained, the animation for the most part was alright until the bright colours start giving you a headache. Really not sure why this has so many 10/10 ratings unless ofc people are fake hyping which is what most of the reviews seem to show. Best to stick to what your good at Marvel and it's not this.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","26 December 2018","When I saw the teaser at the end of 2017 after Spider-Man Homecoming came out, I became really interested as did my brother and later this year we saw it on its second weekend. To our surprise, we loved it so much I consider it the number one movie of the year. Even more so than Avengers Infinity War.Not only does it pay homage to the Spider-Man legacy, but it also respects everything that made it so iconic since the 1960s. The writing from Phil Lord who directed the 21 Jump Street movies, The Lego Movie, and Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs with Christopher Miller is very good making for some nice humor and really solid emotion and drama and the idea of other spider people coming from other dimensions is done really well. Also the character arc for Miles Morales, a likeable character by the way, is really compelling as he struggles to find who he is.The music score is atmospheric and beautiful and the song choices don't feel out of place which is very rare. The pacing is really good and there's not even a dull moment. The directing from three directors including Peter Ramsey (who directed DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians) is superb and the voice acting is entertaining with Shameik Moore Jake Johnson Hailee Steinfeld Mahershala Ali Brian Tyree Henry Lily Tomlin Luna Lauren Velez John Mulaney Nicolas Cage Chris Pine and Leiv Schreiber giving fantastic performances.And last but not least the action sequences and the animation which is by far the best elements of the movie. The Spider-Men costumes and the Spider-Women costumes are well detailed and the choreography for the action revolving around them are some of the best I've seen in animation history since the Kung Fu Panda franchise. Especially the leap of faith sequence which I'm sure you've all seen from the teaser trailer which was the highlight of the film to me.Anyway, Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse is for my perspective the best Spider-Man movie and one of the best animated movies of 2018. A sequel and spinoff is in the works and with that, this receives a LordoftheFuture seal of approval. Go see it!","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","jos-dsouza","18 January 2019","If this movie is for the kids, I doubt if any of them will even understand the plot and the purported humor. They tried to complicate the plot too much.
So it is the adults who are going ga ga over a kids movie. So much for the purpose. But who cares when the box office cash is flowing.
I found the plot to be mushed and too complicated. The animation seemed blurred in many places. I dont know if that was the intention. And the 3D effects are nothing to rave about. Very Ordinary.There are far better 3D animation movies out there and I wont rate this in the list of Top-10 3D animated movies..","9/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","TheMovieDiorama","16 December 2018","It took Sony over a decade to finally create a decent superhero flick that involves not one web slinger, but six of them. Well, better late than never I suppose. However, it's not just a decent adaptation. Oh no no no! Much to my surprise (and everyone else's), it is one of the strongest superhero blockbusters to ever be released. In a time where saturation and fatigue is settling in, it is incredibly refreshing to see one beautiful animation reinvigorate an entire genre. Student Miles Morales is having a hard time dictating his own life, but after being bitten by a radioactive spider he soon comes to terms with his new powers. Stop right there! We've seen this far too many times now. Fortunately, something unique is injected into the repetitive origin story that we all know and love. Parallel dimensions are merged, forcing six alternate ""Spider-Creatures"" to team up and stop Kingpin from destroying worlds. So why after all these years does this work? Well, we actually have to thank the failures that came before it. The origin story has been told countless times, the writers know this and intelligently use that to their advantage. Satirising 'Spider-Man 3' and the infamous ""emo"" dance sequence. It almost lovingly pays homage to previous iterations, but translates the mediocrity into humour that consistently hits with every line of dialogue. Honestly, haven't laughed this much during a film in many years. The humour is never forced, with each punchline ingeniously executed heightening the personality of the various incarnations of Spider-Man. Mix that with the astute action that feels both chaotic and beautiful, creating frequent doses of entertainment.Then the ambitious amount of character development that is spread between Miles, Peter and Gwen (the other three are utilised mainly for comedy) allows warmth and humanity to be at the core of the story. You see the natural progression of Miles as he experiences tragedy, you witness Peter wanting to repair broken bonds with MJ. The familiar yet unfamiliar environment and the newly obtained powers allows them to interact with each other, becoming better superheroes and people. It doesn't stop there though. The family life of Miles is then tested as he rapidly becomes distant from them, establishing a delicate relationship with his father and uncle. Kingpin's motives into creating a dimensional collider, although thinly developed, adds a layer of sympathy towards him. And so much more! What I'm trying to get at, is that the screenplay balances everything. It's a perfectly toned story that nails absolutely every aspect. A rare achievement for the majority of family-friendly blockbusters, whilst still catering to hardcore Marvel fans. The pop art animation is sensational. Various shots of Miles swinging between skyscrapers were breathtaking. The excessive use of vivid colours enables the comic book style to seep through the screen, almost crafting a visual comic strip. Subtitled onomatopoeia and dialogue further aids the comic aesthetic. The voice acting was decent. Whilst there were no standouts, all the actors were consistently good and gave life to the animation. Was a nice surprise hearing Cage as noir Spider-Man. My only critique, and it comes down to personal taste, is the overuse of pop music. A trend all too popular in modern animations, it may feel current now but in years to come will become exhaustingly outdated. An all original score would've been more beneficial. Suffice to say, Sony finally delivered the film that Spider-Man fans deserve. A gorgeous web of entertainment that will appeal to everyone.","1/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","krishkhatiwada","19 December 2018","Summary: MUST WATCH in cinemas. Do not watch this movie on your little phone or laptop.You have probably already noticed everyone talking about how amazing the amimation is, and all of it is 100 percent true. I find it hard to describe the animation and be able to justify how amazing it is, so go witness it for yourself on a big screen. The movie is funny and ""over-the-top"" in the best way possible. Soundtrack is really good.Pros:
All the characters are surprising well developed considering their unequal screen time, but off course this is Miles Morales' story first and foremost and he gets to shine. His arc is great and the ending to this arc is executed really well.
All supporting characters are well thought out and have their own moments to shine.Con:
I felt that a few emotional beats failed to really hit me, and be totally invested in Miles' story.All in all, Spider-Man: Into the spiderverse is an awesome movie to watch and I hope we get to see this type of animation further developed and used.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","andrewburgereviews","30 April 2019","The triple, yes, triple directed (Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman) ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" runs like a comic-book from the year 3019, a mostly stop-motion animation style executed to a revolutionary level, but also mixing noir, anime and freaking Looney Tunes-inspired cartoons. It's one of the best films ever when it comes strictly to animation, every frame filled with clever pop culture references of which I probably missed most.Albeit, this is a very stylized film, even for an animation. Young, chic and cool as hell, this is a blast to watch from start to finish and, thankfully, the style does not get too much in the way of substance. But this film does not go too deep in the feel department, although for something that looks this cool and restless I was mostly satisfied with the treatment for its characters. They all lost someone or something, including the villain here, which is Wilson Fisk a.k.a. Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) even though the film does not treat him with the same sympathy as the heroes. You must argue that this is normal, and it would be, but by the end I felt for the big guy.But indulge me as I get back to the animation. Its quality resides not only in its ans-amble look, but also in the design of its characters. I am still amazed by Kingpin's gargantuan look, spawning a black suit and tie with a white shirt and his imposing bald head stuck in the middle looking asymptotically close to a parody, yet it wasn't. This extreme design creates an intensity and pace that never really stops, not even in the film's quieter moments.Between the ""you can do this"" and ""believe in yourself"" teenage angst there are many fourth wall moments, most notably the way it parodies previous Spider-Man materiel, especially a certain dance in the street. There is a lot of fan service here as this film's ultimate point is to symbolize Spider-Man as an ideal rather than a person. But Spider-Man is not worthy of something like this. He is too stylish and not morally complicated enough, but the effort was visible and admirable.""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a hip, creative teenager with big dreams and it does not have enough patience to involve itself emotionally too much. But it pays you back with every single frame. If you are a fan of animation, this is a must-see.","4/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","shakes77","2 January 2019","Where do I begin with this film? I'll keep it brief:
Hopefully zero spoilers!
Let's start with the visuals - Sony have taken the game forward with this animation! It's breathtaking, beautiful and really is like you're watching a living comic book. It's visually stunning and defines the quality of this film from outset. Even the dots on the screen to represent the comic book style - amazing!The story is so good and does justice to bring the Miles Morales story to the fore. Mixing the characters from the multiverse is done so well - all lovable given the right amount of screen time respectively.It's genuinely funny - if no one laughs when you watch it then it's probably the zombie apocalypse - the jokes are heartfelt and honest. That's not to say that this film doesn't have the feels - it does - but used in the right way.Finally - the music. We all know Post Malone is a genius and this soundtrack is epic - better than Kendrick Lamar's Black Panther - and used so well throughout the film.This ia a wonderful film that will make you fall in love with or reaffirm your love for Spiderman while at the same time introducing Miles Morales as the future of the Spider-verse.Stay for both post-credit scenes - worth it. Also look out for Stan Lee's cameo in the film - emotional.","8/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","martinmcdonough","28 January 2019","I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. Usually, a ""first"" super hero movie gives us the hero's backstory, the origin of their powers, how they grapple with these new found powers, some sort of personal tragedy (that ultimately leads them to becoming a hero instead of a villain), and a focus point for the resolution of their conflicting issues in the form of whatever shape or form the villain takes. After that, it's sequel after endless sequel.I get it.What I don't get is the purpose of THIS movie. There already IS a Spider-Man. He's Peter Parker, photographer for the Daily Bugle, and so on and so forth. We all know about his Aunt, Uncle, the radioactive spider, J. Jonah, M.J. and the cadre of bad dudes he eventually takes on (and down). So, with that in mind, I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be (1) yet another re-imagining of the story for a newer, hip audience, (2) an introduction of several new characters, or (3) an intense marketing ploy to get young viewers interested in the printed version of these heroes? Why else would each character have it's own ""Issue #1"" cover shown during the movie as well as their own brief backstory / origin explanation?It has to be one of those explanations because in every stand-alone movie or comic book, the super hero fights the bad guy typically by himself / herself without the aid of other super heroes (Avengers and other super groups notwithstanding). Spider-Man, Superman, Batman, et al always fought the Green Goblin, Lex Luthor and the Joker (among others) by themselves. But in this movie, five (or was it six) Spider-Men/Women were needed to take Kingpin down? Not likely.Also, this movie had alot going on and went nowhere. The start of the movie was tedious, plodding and slow. And, most importantly, the formula was incredibly predictable. If there were any jokes, they fell flat and were unremarkable, sans the obligatory Stan Lee cameo as the comic shop owner.Once the action started, it was kind of pointless and repetitive. And I kept coming back to the central question I had while watching the movie, as they kept introducing version after version of Spider-Men: do these comic characters already exist somewhere else and this movie is just a ploy to expose them to a wider audience?So, the questions are: Are we being exposed to the NEW Spider-Man? Are we being exposed new, multiple Spider-Men? Why were there no new villains (and making Dr. Octopus a woman is NOT making a new villain, by the way). All of that (and more) brings me back to the central idea of this review - I'm not sure what the point of this movie was.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","26 September 2021","Miles Morales(Moore, easy to relate to, more interesting than many others, with his bilingual, biracial background) is a huge fan of Spider-Man, so he's of course ecstatic when he gets a chance to meet him. And then he meets another one, who's kind of jaded. And that's not the last good person he meets who has that set of abilities...So this is easily the best solo movie featuring the titular character(s). It's just so incredibly well done in almost every single way. The animation doesn't only take countless traits directly from the medium of comic books, it basically puts one on the silver screen, the first time that's truly been done. Music, both the original score and the licenced songs, work astonishingly well, are deeply memorable. It's tremendously funny employing countless different types of comedy... situational, references, wit, sarcasm, sight gags, not to mention its amazing use of subversion of expectation, which also works for the drama. This is tremendously moving. The action is exciting, cool and impactful. It was honestly about time for some diversity for this New York hero - can you believe that in 16 years, 6 live-action entries, 3 continuities, we still didn't have even one non-white lead? And instead of resting on its laurels, it also includes multiple superpowered women, one of whom is Asian.This is arguably too intense for anyone below the age of 9, and be ready to have a reassuring conversation with any child you show this to as soon as the credits roll(be sure to stay through them for the stinger!). Other than that, there is nothing featured that means it can only be watched by teens or adults. And yet it manages to be very mature. I recommend this to anyone who thinks that there is some chance that they might find the concept appealing. 10/10.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","view_and_review","30 December 2018","You know, I had my doubts about this movie. Spider-Man as a full animation. I just kept thinking, ""gonna be quirky."" Well, it was quirky at times, but it worked.The fact that they toyed with the idea of multiple universes actually made the quirkiness work. The featured universe has a new Spider-Man by the name of Miles Morales. When other universes collide with his we get multiple versions of Spider-umm... beings. I can't call them Spider-Men or Women because one of them was actually a pig. I know it sounds strange and blasphemous even, but it worked.The story worked really well and the animation-ness of it allowed for some freedom with the action. I wasn't mad at it because it didn't go too far off the rails. It held onto enough real Spidey drama to suspend the hardcore Spider-Man fans while diverging enough to attract those looking for something new. I liked it a whole lot more than I expected to.","6/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","dromasca","3 February 2019","I do not have the habit of apologizing for my guilty pleasures, and I will not do it this time either. From time to time I love to watch animation movies. I do it not only for the nostalgia of Walt Disney's masterpiece or to remember the pleasure of sharing the experience with my kids some time ago (it's the turn of my grand-kids now), but also because I believe that the animation films, like any other genre, have their own successes as well as failures. When it succeeds, good animation is an aesthetic pleasure, a source of emotions and thrills, a joy that we remember in time as we remember any other good films. But this is not the case with 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' - the latest success from the House of Marvel. And I will not argue with the success either.The more ambitious films of the comic-inspired genre are trying to bring new ideas to attract viewers, as even the most passionate fans of the genre need something new from time to time. In 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse', not even this new idea is exactly original - I've already seen in quite a few other movies the heroes of different comic series as they were brought to the screen and combined as heroes into the same story. In this case, the heroes of the various variants drawn or derived from Spider-Man, including Spider-Man Noir and Spider Girl, are gathered in one place (Manhattan, where else). Parallel universes of different stories with spider-men meet for the pleasure of the connoisseurs. Those less familiar with the sub-genre characters will not get that much from this reunion, and the resulting action did not seem terribly interesting to me either.The result is, in my opinion, that we are dealing with yet another routine movie (animation movie this time), similar to just another magazine in a comics collection. For the enthusiasts it is important not to miss any issue. As an occasional spectator, nothing in the 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' seemed to me to be special, neither the animation nor the 3-D effects, neither the action nor the humor or the characters (the good or the bad). I'm sure this film will take its place in the collection and I am also sure that I'll forget it quickly. Its makers have been able to create something sparkling but already dusty before time.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Brevin_Campbell","24 December 2018","A Review from a comic book nerd XDWhen going into Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse I was very excited. I had been reading Miles Morales since 2014 alongside Kamala Khan, and while I never loved him as much as I loved Kamala I had always enjoyed the story of Miles in the Ultimate Universe. He felt different from Peter Parker as he was more grounded in his responsibility to his family first. He was never defined by some major death of a family member the way Peter was, but rather instead by the loss of his Peter Parker. He became Spider-Man to honor his Peter's legacy, and that felt like a solid motivation to me.Back in the Ultimate Universe era Bendis was on a hot streak with Jessica Jones, Daredevil, and other street level heroes. This fine tuned writing really did well for the Ultimate Spider-Man as he would eventually create a really powerful bond between 616 Peter Parker and the 1610 one, and it was this relationship that I was elated to see get portrayed on the big screen.However there was one major worry I had about this film, and that was the entire concept of the spider verse. I just never liked the idea of a billion spider characters all coming together in one big giant event, and I defiantly didn't want it in Miles's first movie when he should be the focus. It also made me feel like these writers didn't think Miles could stand on his own which also irked me. Luckily though in the film these other characters don't take away from the character of Miles Morales as the film still revolves around him. The other Spider characters are kind of just there to help felt the big bad, and because the film is still called ""Into the Spider-Verse,"" but there not major. I did like Spider-Man Noir a lot, and also Penni Parker was cool too.In regards to the animation for the film I felt it always looked pretty crisp and clean. I liked the style of allowing a comic book come to life in animation. It allows for it to feel more realistic, and for the colors to start to pop more. You can tell that the writers put a lot of love and care when crafting this film with the stylization in mind. It is something that is both amazing and spectacular. Pun intended. :-PThere is quite a lot in the film that pulls from Miles's story in the Ultimate Universe. I really enjoyed seeing Ultimate Green Goblin realized on the big screen, and his battle against Peter Parker was absolutely great. I also loved the death of Ultimate Peter Parker as it both dark and brutal. I literally started to have goosebumps in the theater when watching it. There was also the bond between Aaron Davis and Miles that was captured perfectly, and when Aaron died it felt like my soul left my body.That being said despite my love for this scene I did find Aaron's death to be a bit problematic. It makes Miles lose some of his individuality in my opinion. And with the movie trying so hard to get us to see that Miles is more than a Peter Parker knock off the idea that Miles would need another major loss to define him really undercuts his development. Especially when we have a more compelling story to tell with his relationship with his Uncle were Miles is caught between the world of crime and the world of a hero.Going into some performances I thought everyone did a pretty solid job. I thought Chris Pine's portrayal of Peter Parker was very original and a different take on the character. I found Jake Johnson's Peter to be absolutely amazing and quite memorable too. Hailee Steinfeild as Gwen Stacy was perfect casting in my opinion, and her friendship that she created with Miles was really heartfelt. And I can't wait for that to be developed more if we ever get a sequel to this movie.Overall this was a exceptional film with a really heartfelt story. It understands what makes Miles a really compelling character, and was just a lot of fun to watch on screen, and so for that reason and others I truly believe that this movie deserves many accolades.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Zac_La_Porte","7 August 2023","It's without a doubt that what really shines about this Spider-Man movie is its gorgeous blend of 2D animation techniques and 3D computer graphics. Say if it were still an animated or even just a live-action film, but excluding the stylish visual aspect that the creators were able to piece together, Into the Spider-Verse would be exciting, humorous, heartfelt, but it would lack being truly memorable. It feels like the style the filmmakers chose gains them a point that brings them to jump over a barrier that that separates the unforgettable and the fantastic-but-still-disposable.Miles Morales is an awkward young teenager who also happens to be the protagonist of the film, as he suddenly gains spider-like superpowers after being bitten by a spider. But when a threat against the Multiverse shows up, he must team up with other individuals from different dimensions and become the Spider-Man of his universe. In terms of the animation techniques, which are better described as distinguishable animation techniques combined together, you can probably find a dozen dissections of the style used here.This is an absolutely beautiful movie to look at; singular action sequences alone with take your breath away. But the story, which is paced perfectly with a smooth runtime between 110 minutes and 120 minutes, is also to desire when it comes to making a superhero movie. The characters are excellent; all voiced by talent, and there's a lot of jokes that hit the spot as well. For most audiences, the thing about the story that will attach to most of them other than the fact that it's very entertaining, is the emotional family aspect and themes of grief it wants to take on. By the end, some of these grief concepts aren't touched on satisfyingly enough, but a sequel might address some of these leftover details.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","10/10"

This film gives nonstop punches with awesome fight scenes, and plenty of fresh humor between the fights.Each of the voice actors felt perfect for their counterpart, even Nick Cage as Spider man Noire.But of course, what I loved the most was the amazing animation. Unique, accurate, and every different spider man has its own art style! Penny has a more manga art style, Spider Ham has a very cartoony style, and Noire has the 40 and 50's crime show vibe. And it nailed ALL OF THEM!The plot took some turns I really wasn't expecting, and tons of tiny details put into the movie made me pleasantly surprised. For example, how real those moments in school felt before Miles was spider man. All that talk about puberty had me dying.So, I'm conclusion, if you like action movies, see this movie. If you like comedy, see this movie. If you like superheroes, see this movie. Absolutely incredible film, and well deserving of a 10/10","10/10"

The visuals in the movie are just amazing, but sometimes can get too much.The trailer was perfect cuz it didn't show most of the action (that's how trailers are supposed to be!). The movie is not boring!! It keeps you awake and interested. Every minute of the movie is worthy. Different type of superhero movie.
Go watch it in the cinema!! Great experience...","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Littleman95","30 November 2020","Since I follow the artist that gives life to Spider-Gwent I was interested into watch it and see if they used her in a proper way.
Well, I found nothing interesting in this cartoon. Nothing special. On one side the base idea is quite intriguing but how is developed is not for adults. And there are some ""spider-man"" that, in my opinion, are not actually spider-man. What I'm saying is that there are some things that are too much at the edge of the concept of Spider-Man. The real one, I mean.And the animation is so... squared. Was released in 2018, right?Conclusion: just a cartoon for kids.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","potatovsgaming","19 December 2018","I have never seen a superhero movie like this before. An animated superhero movie like this... I've never seen anything like it. Would recommend to see in theaters before it's to late.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","kid_slackerz","17 December 2018","They say if a fan writes your movie it gonna be trash, mind you this is far from. From the little nod to Raimi's spiderman, to the origin story that was done to death.. this is a true spidey fan movie. Although you may not be familiar with miles morales but you have at least seen the 90's show and this is that but brought to life only the magic of cinema can.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","silverlve","24 December 2018","This movie was such a great bundle of fun, it's colorful, crazy active and so funny. It moves like a living comic book at times with so much action and laughs thrown in.
Loved how the story flowed, the characters all had great personalities and the build to the climax will keep you on the edge. Can't wait to own this one.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","TheBigSick","15 December 2018","Most of the characters are unoriginal, and are plagiarized from previous work. For instance, the villain Octavius is copied from the 2004 stunner Spider-Man 2. Also, there is a girl character from Japanese cartoon. The motivation of the movie is confusing, too. It is really unnecessary to make such a movie. Perhaps it is politically correct to think : why does the spider-man have to be a white? It could also be a black. OK, why does Jesus Christ have to be a white? He could also be a black. Well, cash grab should be another motivation, as Sony does not have much IP. Besides, the premise, or setting, of the film is unconvincing. Why would there be multiple universes?","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","riovegaz","23 December 2018","Into the spider-verse really brought something new to the spider-man universe.It is very light-hearted in any way. With some funny anf emotional moments inside it.The unique animation style was visually stunning and really pushed to say that this is one of the best animated movie ive ever seen..","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse","Slarkshark","7 November 2020","This is the Spider-Man we know and love. Consider this a sequel to the original trilogy with Tobey Maguire. In my opinion and many others, Dad bod Peter Parker is the Tobey version. Just knowing that makes this whole movie so much cooler. But trust me, that's not the only thing that makes this film cool, not by a long shot.I will guarantee you have never seen an animated feature like this. This is new, exciting, and the future. Visually superior to everything out there, especially since it's a full length movie, not just a short such as 'Love, Death, & Robots'. The music and sound editing was also amazing and worked so well with all their chosen scenes.Every voice actor was incredible. Though I have to give Jake Johnson the most credit. He is the one who makes us remember why Spider-Man is so beloved and the most relatable when it comes to superheroes. He has been through so much and keeps on getting up, but he's tired and beaten down. He's gone through those struggles and trials that we all endure in life. However, he receives new hope and a desire to fix the wrongs in his life. Some of the other characters are a little out there, but hey it's a multi-verse so it works.I have no reservations in saying this is by far the best Spider-Man movie we have had since the first two in the Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire trilogy; it may even be better. When I first saw the trailer I said sarcastically ""oh great another Spider-Man movie, just what we need"". Little did I know at the time, but that statement could actually not be more true. I in no way expected it to be this good.","9/10"
